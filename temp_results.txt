Coming soon!

The sentiment over time to stock price over time graph has not yet been created yet.

This is because the sentiments being calculated are still not up to my standard.

The current analysis models I am using seem to have trouble differentiating between
negative sentiment for Apple, and negative sentiment in general (and vice versa).
For example, an article like "Apple to donate basic resources after devestating flood"
should have a very positive sentiment for Apple, but NewsMTSC and FlairNLP especially
may have trouble differentiating the subjects.
