        "title": "Microsoft Says 'Disappointment' of New MacBook Pro Has More People Switching to Surface Than Ever Before",
        "body": "Microsoft has announced November was its best month ever for consumer Surface sales. In a blog post, the company said more people are switching from Macs to Surface devices than ever before following the \"disappointment\" of the new MacBook Pro, particularly among professional users.\nMore people are switching from Macs to Surface than ever before. Our trade-in program for MacBooks was our best ever, and the combination of excitement for the innovation of Surface coupled with the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro \u2013 especially among professionals \u2013 is leading more and more people to make the switch to Surface, like this. It seems like a new review recommending Surface over MacBook comes out daily. This makes our team so proud, because it means we\u2019re doing good work.\nShortly after the new MacBook Pro launched, Microsoft launched a trade-in promotion offering MacBook Pro and MacBook Air owners up to $650 credit towards a new Surface Book or Surface Pro 4. Microsoft also unveiled the Surface Studio in October, and the all-in-one desktop has been met with positive reviews.\nMicrosoft's Surface Book starts at $1,499, the same price as Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Pro with a standard row of function keys. Touch Bar-equipped models start at $1,799 for 13-inch models and $2,399 for 15-inch models.",

        "title": "Super Mario Run requires a persistent internet connection to play, no offline mode due to piracy concerns",
        "body": "Super Mario Run is set to debut next week; the first Mario game for iPhone. In the game, Mario runs forward automatically and players use one finger to make him jump up onto new platform, avoid obstacles and collect coins. Both Apple and Nintendo is hyping its launch with demos at retail stores and a round of press interviews.\nHowever, one tidbit is putting a bit of a downer on the whole thing. It turns out that Super Mario Run will require a persistent internet connection to be playable, which significantly limits the appeal of a mobile game \u2026\nIn an interview with Mashable, producer Shigeru Miyamoto explains that Super Mario Run will require a constant connection to a network for the game to be played, as the company is worried about software piracy.\nThe game is free to download but features a one-time $9.99 purchase to unlock all levels. iOS software piracy is possible on jailbroken devices with app stores dedicated to downloading cracked apps and games.\nFrom Mashable, Miyamoto says there is no ability to play offline to protect against software piracy:\nFor us, we view our software as being a very important asset for us. And also for consumers who are purchasing the game, we want to make sure that we\u2019re able to offer it to them in a way that the software is secure, and that they\u2019re able to play it in a stable environment. We wanted to be able to leverage that network connection with all three of the [Super Mario Run] modes to keep all of the modes functioning together and offering the game in a way that keeps the software secure. This is something that we want to continue to work on as we continue to develop the game. Just to be clear: When you say \u201csecurity,\u201d you mean the risk of piracy, right? That\u2019s correct.\nAccording to the transcribed interview, Nintendo is worried about piracy risks as the game is launching in 150 countries on devices it does not control. He says that the network connection is used to update game saves and sync progress across devices via a Nintendo cloud account. They wanted to have the World Tour story mode available offline \u2018at one point\u2019 but this proved to be a technical challenge as the game state has to cooperate with the other two modes, Toad Rally and Kingdom.\nIt does not seem like this news will be received well. One of the primary advantages of iPhone games is that they are not tethered to a particular location and can be played anywhere. Requiring an internet connection means the game will be unavailable on plane journeys, underground trips and various other places users might conceivably want to play.\nThere\u2019s a chance Nintendo could relax the restrictions in a future update. Miyamoto does not sound steadfast in his statements, indicating that the design is based off the \u2018current development environment\u2019. Nevertheless, offline play will not be available at launch and this will likely dampen the enthusiasm for an otherwise blockbuster iOS title.\nSuper Mario Run will be available on the App Store for iPhone and iPad next week, December 15. The title is free to download and try with a one-time $9.99 purchase to unlock all content and levels. You can sign up to be notified when the game launches.",

        "body": "It seems that the iPhone 7 won\u2019t be the only flagship smartphone to ditch the 3.5mm headphone socket: SamMobile is reporting \u2018confirmation\u2019 of an earlier rumor that Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8 \u2013 set to be unveiled in February \u2013 will follow Apple\u2019s lead.\nThe move is said to be in an effort to make the device thinner while allowing for a larger battery. The report says that Samsung will use a USB-C port for charging and data transfers, and it\u2019s likely this will also be available to those who want to continue using wired headphones.\nThe S8 is also said to be adopting a feature long-rumored for next year\u2019s iPhone: replacing the physical Home button with a virtual one embedded into the display.\nApple\u2019s \u2018courageous\u2019 decision to ditch the headphone socket of course generated a great deal of controversy. By the time Samsung does the same, it\u2019s likely that a lot of the fuss will have died down as increasing numbers of consumers switch to wireless headphones.\nSamsung\u2019s S8 will be an especially important launch for the company following its disastrous recall and abandonment of the Note 7.",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Tim Cook assures employees that it is committed to the Mac and that \u2018great desktops\u2019 are coming",
        "body": "One of the memes to come out of the somewhat contentious rollout of the MacBook Pro is that Apple has given up on the desktop Mac. Given the slower upgrade cycle of desktops and how well my Retina 5K iMac is holding up, it took me a while to pay attention to what was going on there \u2014 until it had reached a fever pitch.\nThe consensus was that Apple is no longer interested in keeping up its desktop business because the portable market was eating it alive.\nIn a posting to an employee message board, CEO Tim Cook seems intent on putting that particular branch of discussion to bed.\n\u201cSome folks in the media have raised the question about whether we\u2019re committed to desktops,\u201d Cook wrote. \u201cIf there\u2019s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.\u201d\nCook cites the far better performance of desktop computers, including screen sizes, memory, storage and more variety in I/O (ha) as a reason that they are \u201creally important, and in some cases critical, to people.\u201d\nSo no matter how you feel about the state of the Mac at the moment, you have new machines to look forward to. No mention of whether that meant iMac or Mac Pro or both, but at the very least it\u2019s encouraging to those of us who couldn\u2019t live without a desktop computer.\nAlso posted to the message board was a section on what Cook thinks is Apple\u2019s greatest differentiating factor, which I found particularly interesting. Though the Mac statements may be the news hook here, hence the headline, there are some interesting things in this section to pull apart, as well.\nHe\u2019s responding to the following question: What do you consider to be Apple\u2019s biggest differentiator, and what can employees do to foster and advance those efforts?\nHe first says that the people and culture are the foundation, which in itself is really not that revelatory; every tech CEO says that.\n\u201cOur greatest differentiator is our culture and our people. They are the foundation by which everything else comes about. Without great people and a great environment that people can live in, we wouldn\u2019t have intellectual property. We wouldn\u2019t have the best products. We wouldn\u2019t have the inventions or features I mentioned earlier,\u201d Cook responds.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s that \u2018change the world\u2019 attitude and boldness that\u2019s deeply embedded in our culture, that \u2018good isn\u2019t good enough.\u2019 All of this is the fuel for everything else that we do.\u201d\nThis kind of thinking in its culture is often cited by Apple executives and ex-employees as a truism. Apple pushes. That doesn\u2019t always (ever) result in perfection but it does result in truly impressive results from time to time, like the recent AirPods, which are an incredible weaving together of Apple\u2019s hardware and software teams to produce something that works so much better than what came before it\u2019s laughable.\nCook also re-emphasizes this commonly stated stance in the posting. \u201cFrom a strategic point of view, we also focus on things where software, hardware and services all come together and bring out the magic that only Apple can,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s our secret sauce. It shows up in a lot of different places, and it\u2019s something that we look for in new employees.\u201d\nBut what comes after is probably the most interesting. He says this:\nYou can rarely see precisely where you want to go from the beginning. In retrospect, it\u2019s always written like that. But it\u2019s rarely like that. The fantastic thing about Apple employees is they get excited about something, and they want to know how it works. What it will do. What its capabilities are. If they want to know about something in an entirely different industry, they start pulling the string and see where it takes them. They\u2019re focused more on the journey, which enables so many great things to happen. Just in the past couple years, pulling that string on Watch and fitness led to ResearchKit, and ResearchKit led to CareKit. We\u2019ve got a ton of things on our roadmap that I can\u2019t talk about, but that I\u2019m incredibly excited about, that are the result of pulling that string and not being bound by the box that so many people in life get bound by.\nNo company on the planet is willing to go as far as Apple to find out whether there is a there, there. The Apple Watch launched with so many features because Apple was willing to let it define its own role as determined by customers. It was probably the world\u2019s most expensive focus group. And it managed to do that while still providing a genuinely useful tool right out of the gate.\nHis conclusion drives that point home.\n\u201cWith so many things that we\u2019ve done, we don\u2019t do it because there\u2019s a return on investment. We don\u2019t do it because we know exactly how we\u2019re going to use it. We do it because it\u2019s clear it\u2019s interesting and it might lead somewhere. A lot of the time it doesn\u2019t, but many times it leads us somewhere where we had no idea in the beginning.\u201d\nI think this is an often overlooked cultural strength at Apple. A willingness to devote extra-ordinary resources, time and attention to a problem or piece of technical research because there is a feeling that it may lead somewhere \u2014 eventually. All too often technology companies are obsessed with the goal. The end result. And everything is bent into service of achieving that goal.\nThis methodology is not ineffective, but it is short-sighted. You may be able to get the result that you wanted by driving hard toward that goal, but you\u2019re never going to recognize the better, potentially more rewarding result you didn\u2019t expect. You\u2019ll never see it because any branch that leads you to such a potentiality would have gotten killed off as a distraction or failure before it had time to bear fruit.\nAnyway, this isn\u2019t a philosophical screed, it\u2019s internal PR, but it rings true with the company\u2019s public actions and what I know of its internal culture. Interesting stuff.\nIn the same Apple Web posting, Cook also talked about why he chose to go to the meting with President-elect Trump last week, and you can read about that here.\nThe full postings are below:",

        "title": "After bragging about beating AirPods to market, Bragi delays Headphone, offers PDF to leave under tree",
        "body": "Accessory maker Bragi has announced delays for its upcoming cord-free earbud product called \u201cThe Headphone.\u201d\nPart of Germany-based Bragi\u2019s story has always been that it was one of the first to market with a truly wireless, cord-free earbud, The Dash. That product didn\u2019t receive glowing reviews over the last year, but when the company announced a less expensive and refined version with The Headphone, it looked like it could be a true competitor to Apple\u2019s wireless AirPods. But the AirPods officially launched last week and are arriving to customers this week, and now Bragi is announcing a delay to its product that was supposed to ship for the earliest pre-order customers in time for Christmas. The product\u2019s estimated shipping date was later pushed back to early January, but it looks like Bragi will miss that date for some pre-orders as well.\nIn an email to customers, the company says it doesn\u2019t have \u201cenough to fulfill all pre-orders.\u201d\nHello Bragi friends, Unfortunately, this email is not the Christmas message we wanted to send\u2026 The Headphone did start its shipping journey from Asia last week. The first Headphones are on their way, but not enough to fulfill all pre-orders\u2026 All of us at Bragi were excited by this milestone, but incredibly disappointed that we couldn\u2019t fulfill all orders.\nThe reason? Bragi is finding manufacturing the products at scale more difficult than it anticipated: \u201c\u2026our production team has been building headphones at a slower speed than expected. Building The Headphone is a precision process with very tight tolerances both physically and electronically. As long as we do not consistently hit those tolerances, the production cadence cannot and should not be increased to maintain the quality.\u201d\nTo make up for the delay, Bragi is offering an extension of 30 days for the sales return warranty for pre-orders made in 2016. As consolation, the company also put together a PDF that you can print out and leave under the tree if you want your friends and family to hate you.\nIn our review, we actually found The Headphone to be a decent cord-free earbud experience and one of the best yet prior to the AirPods launch. It\u2019s harder to recommend them now that AirPods are out at almost the same price point with overall a more solid experience (in-depth comparison coming soon).\nWhile Apple finally launched its AirPods last week following delays from a launch originally planned for late October, it also delayed its new BeatsX wireless earphones into February. A specific reason for the delay wasn\u2019t given, but it\u2019s possible it could be related to supplies of the Apple-designed W1 chip for fast pairing, switching, and maintaining a reliable connection that both the BeatsX and AirPods use.\nAs of writing, Bragi\u2019s website still lists \u201cearly January\u201d for orders placed as of December 1st, but doesn\u2019t otherwise specify when new orders will be shipped out. The company\u2019s memo to customers says it should be able to fulfill all orders in 6 days once it works out kinks in manufacturing, but it doesn\u2019t estimate how long that might take.",

        "body": "Just over a year after Netflix began allowing iOS users to subscribe to its service via in-app purchases, the Netflix app has summited the Top Grossing Apps chart for iPhone on the U.S. App Store. The app had flirted with the No. 1 spot previously on November 14, 2016, when it ended the day at No. 2, and returned to second place yesterday before topping the chart for the first time today.\nThe Netflix app's ascent to the top can be seen in the category ranking history below, from our App Intelligence platform. Following some stumbles in the early days of fall 2015, it's been a steady climb to the No. 1 position. In addition to being the top app in the U.S., it also occupies the No. 1 grossing spot on iPhone in India, Mexico, and Colombia as of this post.\nNetflix has seen its app's revenue increasing steadily, even as it faces challenges in growing its user base in the U.S. Below, we've charted its weekly net revenue on iOS in the U.S. since in-app subscriptions were introduced in fall 2015. Over this time, its weekly net revenue has grown from less than $50,000 to nearly $2.9 million. Last month, Netflix was the No. 7 grossing iOS app overall in the U.S.\nHaving recently added the ability for users to download selected TV shows and movies for offline playback in its app, Netflix has focused on growing its subscriber base through original television and film content, such as its incredibly popular Marvel Entertainment series Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage, which was just renewed for a second season. Netflix also intends to make a big push into unscripted programming with 20 such shows slated to debut in 2017.",

        "body": "Apple is reportedly building its own servers amid suspicions that its hardware is being intercepted prior to its arrival at the company's datacenters.\n(Image: file photo)\nA report by The Information (paywalled) said that the iPhone and iPad maker has \"long suspected\" that servers it orders from the traditional supply chain were intercepted while they were in the mail. That's where \"unknown third parties\" would add chips and modify firmware to \"make them vulnerable to interception.\"\nIt became so much of a concern that the company would assign people to \"take photographs of motherboards and annotate the function of each chip, explaining why it was supposed to be there,\" the report said.\nBuilding its own servers in-house on motherboards it designed and manufactured would be a \"surefire way\" to prevent such interception.\nIt's not clear exactly when Apple began to suspect its servers were being intercepted. But it wouldn't have been a big surprise given that networking giant Cisco fell victim to the same kind of interception tactics.\nDocuments leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden showed that the National Security Agency (NSA) would regularly intercept Cisco equipment in the mail designated for customers, install implants, then place repackaged items back into transit.\nApple's move to create its own servers would indicate a push to develop its own cloud service, rather than rely on third-parties (and rivals), such as Amazon and Google, which currently power Apple's iCloud service.\nBut also bringing that hardware effort in house would add to the company's ever increasing effort to double-down on security, all while cutting out law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

They alleged that the company failed to give them meal and rest breaks, and didn't pay them in a timely manner, among other complaints.\nCalifornia law requires employers to give hourly workers a 30 minute meal break if they're working more than five hours a day. They're also require to provide 10 minute breaks for every four hours worked.\nIn 2013, the case became a class action lawsuit that included California employees who had worked at Apple between 2007 and 2012, approximately 21,000 people. Apple made changes to its scheduling policy in 2012.\nRelated: Apple Store employees tell Tim Cook: We're treated like criminals\nJeffrey Hogue, one of the attorneys who represented the class action, said the $2 million verdict came down last Friday -- but Apple could owe more money.\nThe second half of the case is expected to conclude next week, Hogue told CNNMoney.\nApple (AAPL) did not immediately reply for request for comment.\nIt's unclear how much of the $2 million will go to the workers. If divided evenly, it would be just $95 per employee, but it's likely some of the money will go toward attorney fees.\nThe complaint says Apple's culture of secrecy keeps employees from talking about the company's poor working conditions. \"If [employees] so much as discuss the various labor policies, they run the risk of being fired, sued or disciplined,\" the complaint reads.",

Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, Inc., will be the commencement speaker for the Class of 2017.\n\u201cThe student body at MIT has always appreciated that technology should play a larger role in society,\u201d Cook said in an interview with The Tech. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly excited about [speaking there].\u201d\nCook has led Apple since 2011, after Steve Jobs resigned from that position to become chairman of the board. As CEO, Cook launched Apple Watch and Apple Pay, and introduced the iPhone 7. Prior to being named CEO, Cook oversaw the company\u2019s worldwide sales and operations, and managed Apple\u2019s global supply chain.\n\u201cMr. Cook\u2019s brilliance as a business leader, his genuineness as a human being, and his passion for issues that matter to our community make his voice one that I know will resonate deeply with our graduates,\u201d President L. Rafael Reif told MIT News.\nCook has led Apple through milestones like the sale of its billionth iPhone in July and the finalization of its largest acquisition, the headphones and music streaming service Beats, in August. In February, facing pressure from the FBI to help \u201cunlock\u201d an iPhone used by a terrorist who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., Cook wrote a letter to customers that came down on the side of privacy. He wrote that creating a \u201cbackdoor\u201d in the company\u2019s products would ultimately undermine \u201cthe very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.\u201d\nCook received a B.S. in industrial engineering from Auburn University in 1982, and an MBA from Duke University in 1988. In an interview with The Tech Dec. 7, he spoke about the role of liberal arts in technological innovation, prioritizing long-term vision, and salient human rights issues. The interview has been edited for clarity.\nThe Tech: Thank you for making this time to speak with me. We\u2019re really looking forward to welcoming you at commencement. The first thing I wanted to ask is, why choose to speak at MIT? What interested you about it?\nTim Cook: MIT has always intrigued me because I see a lot of parallels between Apple and MIT. The student body at MIT has always appreciated that technology should play a larger role in society, that it\u2019s not just about technology. It\u2019s about the intersection of technology and liberal arts that\u2019s really great for our country. That parallel endeared me to MIT and I was quite honored to be asked to do it, and I\u2019m incredibly excited about doing it.\nThe Tech: What do you see as the role of liberal arts in tech innovation?\nCook: Apple has always stood at the intersection of the liberal arts and technology. We don\u2019t think technology for technology\u2019s sake advances humanity. It\u2019s the intersection of the two things that really moves the country forward and allows not just us, but other people, to change the world for the better.\nPeople work at Apple because they want to change the world. They want to make the world\u2019s best products that really enrich people\u2019s lives. They come to work every day and focus on how to do that. That\u2019s what has always been the driving force of Apple.\nThe Tech: That sounds like a very unique culture. What is the role of a community\u2019s culture in producing great ideas? What kind of culture do you strive to create at Apple?\nCook: The culture at Apple is very much a change-the-world kind of culture. It\u2019s a culture that deeply believes in a fairly simple North Star, and that North Star is creating the best products in the world that enrich people\u2019s lives.\nThere are lots of things we could work on, and there are always more ideas than we could possibly work on. But the ones we try to choose are the ones that are the best, and make a significant contribution to society. Focus is a part of our culture: we say \u2018no\u2019 to many, many more things than we say \u2018yes\u2019 to. We say no to really good ideas because we know we can only do a few things really, really great.\nOur culture is very focused on caring; people really care about the details here. They know that innovation really comes from people caring deeply about things, and thinking at a much deeper level about a problem that we\u2019re trying to address or a product we\u2019re trying to create. That\u2019s the Apple culture.\nIt\u2019s non-bureaucratic, very collaborative. We strongly believe in collaboration because we think the best work comes from having a diverse culture, bringing people together that look at issues differently, see things through a different lens, have a different life experience. Then you put them together and you provide an environment where people can collaborate, and bounce ideas off one another, and watch the ideas grow and become bigger than any single individual could ever do. That\u2019s what happens here, and it\u2019s really magical.\nThe Tech: How do you choose what problems to focus on?\nCook: That\u2019s a good question. For us, we try to select things where we can control the primary technology. We do things that require hardware, software, and services, because we think the real magic occurs at the intersection of those. We have great debates internally about what things to work on and not, because we know we can only do a few things well.\nWe always pick things that really will change things, that empower people to change the world. We provide tools for people that do that. We\u2019re always looking at how something will be used, and if it will have a broader purpose and benefit to society.\nThe Tech: In that process, how do you balance long term and short term outcomes? What do you do to keep sight of the bigger picture?\nCook: The real answer to that is: we don\u2019t focus on the short term. When we decide to enter a new product category or create a new product, we\u2019re thinking long term about it. We\u2019re very willing to sacrifice short term results for the benefit of the long term.\nWe make sure that we don\u2019t run Apple on a 90-day clock. I realize some companies do that and they think that\u2019s good, but we\u2019re investing in things that will see daylight many years from now. It\u2019s very important that we take the noise out of our thinking, and think about the long-term benefit. That allows us to make investments that others would not, and create products, frankly, that others could not.\nThe Tech: On a more personal level, when you were graduating from college, what did you think you were going to be doing next?\nCook: [Laughs] Something very different than what occurred. When I was a graduate student, I had a class on Corporate Strategy \u2014 I was in business school at Duke at the time. As part of that corporate strategy class, the instructor asked us to prepare a personal strategy \u2014 a fairly detailed one that talked about what you were going to personally accomplish in life and your career and so forth.\nA few years ago, I found that document, and at the time that I found it, it was 25 years old. And I looked at it, and virtually nothing had happened that I\u2019d listed on it.\nI think the lesson there is \u2014 and I\u2019ve really learned this at Apple and I credit Steve [Jobs] being a great mentor here \u2014 the joy of life is really in the journey. If you fixate too much on the specifics, you don\u2019t tend to enjoy the journey along the way. You say, \u201cI\u2019ll get to that after this happens,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to feel great after I graduate,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to do that after I get my first job.\u201d You keep kicking the can down the road, and life passes by.\nI\u2019ve learned over the course of the last couple of decades to enjoy the journey, and not get too fixated on the specifics.\nThe Tech: You\u2019ve said that \u201cevery generation has the responsibility to enlarge the meaning of human rights.\u201d What do you see as the human rights challenge of our generation?\nCook: I think there are many. The ones that are very clear today range from religious freedoms, to LGBT rights, to gender equality. Even though the U.S. has made improvements on racial human rights, there are clearly racial injustices in the world.\nI think if you sort of look at it from a macro point of view, there are issues everywhere, including in this country and in many countries around the world. People may talk about the issues themselves a bit differently, but they\u2019re the same issues of a decade ago, and two decades ago, and five decades ago. There\u2019s progress, so I\u2019m not saying the magnitude of the issue is the same, but I think it\u2019s about each generation moving forward and enlarging the definition of human rights for people.\nYou look at the U.S. and it shows up in many different ways. It\u2019s changing the way people treat each other, because at the end of the day, if you boil it down, it\u2019s about human dignity and human respect, and trying to eradicate the view that people are inferior because of something in their makeup or composition. I think it\u2019s incumbent on all of us to advance it.\nI wouldn\u2019t pin it to a certain thing. I see issues everywhere, although, on a positive note, I see progress in many places as well. We have a lot further to go here. Not only in this country, but even more so in many countries around the world.\nCook will address the graduating class at MIT\u2019s 140th commencement on Friday, June 9.",

        "title": "New MacBook Pro Users Report Improved Battery Life on macOS 10.12.2",
        "body": "Apple released macOS 10.12.2 yesterday with stability improvements and fixes for several key bugs, including major graphics issues plaguing some late 2016 model MacBook Pro users.\nWhat the changelog did not mention is that Apple also removed the \"time remaining\" battery life indicator following an increasing number of battery life complaints, likewise among new MacBook Pro users.\nA new MacBook Pro on macOS 10.12.2 with a 99% charge and an estimated 9 hours and 21 minutes of battery life remaining\nWhat it may have also failed to mention is that macOS 10.12.2 appears to have led to battery life improvements for some users. A growing number of MacRumors forum members using the new MacBook Pro claim to be experiencing longer battery life after updating to macOS 10.12.2, despite experiencing less-than-desirable battery life while running macOS 10.2.1 just days earlier.\nMany of the users using battery apps like coconutBattery have noticed their new MacBook Pro's battery is discharging with lower wattage, and if accurate, the lower power consumption would certainly lead to longer battery life.\nMacRumors forum member lobo1978 \u2014 edited slightly for clarity:\nOk it is official. macOS Sierra 10.12.2 fixed my battery. I am up back to 9-10 hours of regular use. Before updating, idle power consumption was not going lower than 6 watts. On macOS Sierra 10.12.2, it is now <4 watts at 60% brightness with the ambient light sensor on.\nMacRumors forum member JohnnyGo:\nBefore the update was getting 7-9 hours with 50-60% brightness. Now getting >10 hours with 70-75% brightness with the same workload (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on of course).\nAt least a dozen other users have reported similar results since yesterday after upgrading to macOS 10.12.2. Since publishing this article, a number of Reddit users have also confirmed seeing longer battery life.\nWhile the user reports are worth acknowledging, they remain anecdotal and reflect only a small subset of new MacBook Pro users. It remains to be seen if Apple actually made battery life optimizations in the latest macOS Sierra update; if it did, however, Apple could be choosing to do so quietly as to not confirm that battery life issues were actually a problem for some users.\nApple officially says the new MacBook Pro is rated for up to 10 hours of battery life. Specifically, its tech specs page says all new 13-inch and 15-inch models are capable of up to 10 hours of wireless web browsing, up to 10 hours of iTunes movie playback, and up to 30 days of standby time on a single charge.\nFollowing the release of macOS Sierra 10.12.2, Apple told The Loop that, after a lot of testing, it stands behind the 10-hour battery life advertised.\nAs more user reports surface, we should be able to see if the alleged battery life improvements are circumstantial or part of a larger trend.",

        "title": "Super Mario Run made $5 million in under 24 hours",
        "body": "Missed the GamesBeat Summit excitement? Don't worry! Tune in now to catch all of the live and virtual sessions here.\nWhile you collect coins as Mario on your iPhone, Nintendo is collecting fat stacks on cash.\nSuper Mario Run has generated approximately $5 million in in revenues after five million downloads in its first 24 hours, according to intelligence firm Sensor Tower. That\u2019s a far bigger download number than competing data firm Apptopia reported earlier today, but it\u2019s in line with data from app-market-tracking company App Annie, which estimates 4.7 million downloads in the United States in the first day. All of those numbers clearly indicate that Nintendo is riding a massive wave of excitement for its first Mario game in the $36.6 billion mobile gaming market. Super Mario Run is the most-downloaded game in 80 countries and the top-grossing app in 30 of those.\n\u201cIt is easily the best first day for an app launch, game or otherwise,\u201d Sensor Tower head of mobile insights Randy Nelson wrote in a message to GamesBeat.\nBut this early success isn\u2019t a guarantee of future revenues. It\u2019s possible that this initial spike in spending for Super Mario Run could quickly subside. The game is free to download, and then it has only one $10 purchase that unlocks all of its content. Nintendo has not included any way to continue charging players for more items or levels. So that $5 million won\u2019t necessarily grow in a compound way going forward, which is different from the ongoing spending that something like Pok\u00e9mon Go continues to see.\n\u201cBased on the early numbers we see coming in and the response from consumers, we expect Super Mario Run to initially earn on the lower end of our forecast, around $12 million to $15 million in its first month,\u201d SuperData Research analyst and chief executive Joost van Dreunen explained in a note to GamesBeat. \u201cRequiring players to always be online is prohibitive, and the game is still a bit too heavy-handed for quick play on a phone.\u201d\nAt the same time, people are enjoying the game. The average player has spent 15.5 minutes playing in the first 24 hours across four sessions, according to Sensor Tower. Those numbers should start coming down soon as players either reach the end of the content or decide not to spend $10. To keep the game performing well, analysts already expect Nintendo to discount the price.\n\u201cWe anticipate Nintendo to announce a discount after the holidays to keep momentum,\u201d said van Dreunen.\nThat would represent a break from tradition for Nintendo\u2019s console pricing. The publisher is notorious for taking years to drop the prices of its first-party games on 3DS, Wii U, and other systems.",

        "title": "Report: Apple developing indoor mapping features, will use flying drones to collect data for Apple Maps",
        "body": "Apple is looking to continue expansion of Apple Maps with new indoor location mapping features for 2017, such as airport and museum navigation, according to a new Bloomberg story. The company is also working on new turn-by-turn features, including improved directions to switch lanes whilst driving.\nPerhaps most interestingly, the report says Apple plans to deploy a fleet of flying drones to help with data collection efforts for Apple Maps. The drones would be able to analyze street signs, track the status of roadworks and more. Apple does not plan to release a drone as a consumer item to compete with products like the Parrot Drone; the fleet would be for its own private business uses.\nApple already uses a team of camera-equipped vehicles for ground truth efforts; these cars are constantly driving around the world taking photos of places and collecting information about roads through a variety of sensors.\nHowever, these cars have to be manned by a person (self-driving vehicles aren\u2019t a reality quite yet) so the scale of this team is naturally limited. Adding drones in to the mix would greatly expand the reach of this data collection work.\nDrones can also reach places that cars sometimes can\u2019t, as well as skip pedestrian traffic. The Bloomberg report says Apple\u2019s drone fleet could watch the progress of construction projects and then \u201crapidly update the Maps app\u201d with the latest information. The FAA granted Apple\u2019s application to operate an unmanned aircraft system in March 2016.\nHowever, there are a lot of regulations regarding where and when drones can be flown for commercial data collection purposes, so it remains to be seen where Apple\u2019s drones will actually be located in the real world.\nIndoor mapping features for Apple Maps have been rumored for several years. Google already offers indoor mapping of major POI locations in its mapping product. The Bloomberg article says Apple wants to add an indoor view to the Maps app for popular landmarks, museums and airports. An Apple user would then follow instructions on their iPhone to get to their destination inside the buildings.\nIn an August interview, Apple executive Eddy Cue explained that Maps is a big investment for the company with little monetary reward; it is expensive to maintain an accurate worldwide mapping service which has no clear direct revenue stream.\nFlying a fleet of semi-autonomous drones is not cheap either but Apple has the bank balance to make it happen. Bloomberg says Apple has hired at least one person from Amazon\u2019s Prime Air division to get the drone project off the ground.",

        "body": "Dear Apple: Give Us Control Over Stalkerware Michael S. Fischer \u00b7 Follow Published in HackerNoon.com \u00b7 \u00b7 Dec 4, 2016 3 min read -- 9 Listen Share\nIf you, like me, would like to convince Apple to help us, please send a message to Apple referencing this page via their iPhone feedback form. Apple does listen!\nDear Apple:\nI love that you care about our privacy. You fight hard for us when you refuse to hand governments the keys to our phones. You say that enforcing privacy is a civic duty. It\u2019s important to me and to millions of other users. Your stance on privacy protections is one of the many reasons your customers choose Apple products over those of your competitors.\nToday, we need your help in a small but important way.\nIt\u2019s come to light that Uber and other companies have begun tracking our locations in more circumstances than ever. We\u2019ve always relied on their apps to use our location \u2014 to do helpful things like find us a fast and convenient way to get where we want to go.\nBut this time, they\u2019ve gone too far. They\u2019re now insisting that we provide them our location, when we don\u2019t need them to, or don\u2019t want them to, to use their services.\nSpecifically, anyone who installed or upgraded the Uber app in the past few weeks and enabled them to view their location is now giving their location to Uber all the time (unless they subsequently manually disabled their access to their location). Uber can now track us whenever they like \u2014 even if we have no intent to use their service anytime soon, or haven\u2019t used their app in months.\nAnd most users don\u2019t even know Uber and others have this ability. It\u2019s creepy and it\u2019s unnecessary, and makes us unsafe.\nThere\u2019s a word for software that insists they know where you are all the time: Stalkerware.\nHow have Uber and others developed such stalkerware? Through one small loophole, and one that can easily be remedied by Apple.\nAs you know, iOS allows users to control how apps can access the user\u2019s location. There are three choices: \u201cAlways,\u201d \u201cWhen using the app,\u201d or \u201cNever.\u201d These are reasonable options. Some users might never want an app to have access to their location. Others might have a strong trust relationship with the app and its authors and allow the app always to track them.\nMost of us, though, fall into the middle camp: We want to allow apps to use our location for the purpose of providing a service, but want to control our privacy when the app or its authors cease doing business with us. So what we\u2019re asking is simple:\nDon\u2019t allow app developers to disable the \u201cwhen using the app\u201d Location privacy option.\nIt\u2019s simply unnecessary for Uber or others to track us when the app isn\u2019t in use. How do we know this? Because these apps worked adequately before they disabled this option. We were able to meet our drivers by opening the app, finding our location, and hailing a driver. We gave them enough information to get the job done, and we were satisfied with the results.\nUber argues that they want to use more location data to improve the user experience \u2014 for example, to track a rider\u2019s location between the time the driver was summoned and the time the rider was picked up, even if the rider closed the app. That may be so. But that doesn\u2019t mean I or anyone else should be forced to give up my location to them, at their whim.\nSo, Apple, we ask you: Help us keep our privacy and safety. If app developers want to know our location, they can ask us. But we should have the right to give Uber and others our location only when they truly need it \u2014 and the mechanism for doing so already exists. We shouldn\u2019t have to flip a switch to enable our location so we can use it, then flip the switch back to get our privacy back.\nThank you for your help.",

        "title": "Apple Publishes Its First Artificial Intelligence Paper",
        "body": "This article is more than 6 years old.\nEarlier this month, Apple made a splash when it told the artificial intelligence research community that the secretive company would start publishing AI papers of its own. Not even a month later, it\u2019s already starting to make good on that promise.\nApple has published its very first AI paper on December 22. (The paper was submitted for publication on November 15.). The paper describes a technique for how to improve image recognition training using computer-generated images rather than real-world images.\nIn machine learning research, using synthetic images (like those from a video game) to train neural networks can be more efficient than using real-world images. That\u2019s because synthetic image data is already labeled and annotated, while real-world image data requires somebody to exhaustively label everything the computer is seeing \u2014 that\u2019s a tree, a dog, a bike. But the synthetic image approach can be problematic as what the algorithm learns doesn\u2019t always carry over neatly to real world scenes. The synthetic image data \u201cis often not realistic enough, leading the network to learn details only present in synthetic images and fail to generalize well on real images,\u201d the paper from Apple says.\nTo improve training with synthetic image data, the paper suggests what the Apple researchers call Simulated+Unsupervised learning, where the realism of a simulated image is boosted. The Apple researchers use a modified version of a new machine learning technique called Generative Adversarial Networks, which pits two neural networks against each other and has been used to generate photorealistic images.\nThe paper\u2019s lead author is Apple researcher Ashish Shrivastava, who holds a PhD in computer vision from University of Maryland, College Park, according to his LinkedIn. The other Apple employees listed as co-authors on the paper include Tomas Pfister, Oncel Tuzel, Wenda Wang, Russ Webb and Josh Susskind, who co-founded an AI startup that assessed a person\u2019s emotions by looking at facial expressions called Emotient, which Apple acquired earlier this year.\nApple\u2019s first AI paper marks a major step for the company. For years, the AI research community has been critical of Apple\u2019s secretiveness. Its secrecy has even hurt the company\u2019s recruiting efforts for AI talent. The move towards more openness with the community is important for Apple as the push for more advanced AI software spreads across the tech industry. AI software is becoming essential for everything from the camera capabilities in Apple\u2019s latest iPhones to the internet services running in the data center.\nI\u2019ve reached out to Apple for comment.\nGet the best of Forbes to your inbox with the latest insights from experts across the globe.\nFollow me on Twitter.\nSend me a secure tip",

        "title": "macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Removes 'Time Remaining' Battery Life Indicator",
        "body": "macOS Sierra 10.12.2, released this morning, features several key bug fixes and addresses an issue that has plagued some customers who purchased a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar -- battery life.\nApple believes that the battery life indicator in macOS Sierra is ultimately inaccurate and has led to some confusion about battery performance, and so it has been removed in macOS Sierra 10.12.2.\nGoing forward, the battery icon in the Mac's menu bar will offer a look at remaining battery percentage, but it won't provide estimates on how long the MacBook Pro's battery will last. Here's what Apple said about it to The Loop:\nApple said the percentage is accurate, but because of the dynamic ways we use the computer, the time remaining indicator couldn't accurately keep up with what users were doing. Everything we do on the MacBook affects battery life in different ways and not having an accurate indicator is confusing. Besides the apps we are working on all the time, there are a lot of things that are happening in the background that users may not be aware of that affects battery life.\nMacBook Pro buyers have complained about getting less than 10 hours of battery life, reporting as little as three hours of battery life in some cases, but battery performance can vary significantly based on the apps and processes that are running.\nCustomers with poor performance may be using apps that are not optimized for the new MacBook Pro, and on the 15-inch machine, if an app engages the discrete GPU, battery life takes a significant hit. For MacBook Pro owners who are seeing bad battery life, it's worth checking the Activity Monitor to make sure the dGPU is not in use.\nSpotlight indexing, iCloud photo syncing, and other behind-the-scenes processes can also have an impact on battery life, especially when a machine is new.\nAccording to The Loop, Apple has done extensive battery life testing on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and continues to stand by its battery life estimates of up to 10 hours. It seems Apple believes reports of bad battery life are largely based on the faulty indicator, but there have been some real world tests that don't rely on the estimate and still show poor performance.\nApple says its new MacBook Pros can get up to 10 hours of battery life when browsing the web or when watching iTunes movies.",

        "title": "Apple says more iPhone 6s models may be affected by random shutdowns, issuing iOS update",
        "body": "Apple has said that the random shutdowns plaguing some iPhone 6s models may be more widespread than it first believed.\nApple initially said that it found that battery components in a particular batch of iPhones were exposed to the air for too long before assembly, causing the batteries to cut out. It has now updated its statement to say that some customers with phones from outside this batch have also experienced shutdowns, and that it will be issuing an iOS update to help track down the cause \u2026\nIn a support document seemingly not yet posted in English, Apple said that it needed additional diagnostic data to determine the cause of the problem. However, it believes that a software fix may be possible for units outside the original batch.\nOutside the affected batch, a small number of customers reported an unexpected shutdown. Some of these shutdowns may be normal, because the iPhone will shut down to protect its electronic components. To gather more information, we will add an additional diagnostic feature to the iOS software update that is released next week. This feature collects a variety of information in the coming weeks that may help us improve algorithms for managing battery performance and shutdown operations. If such improvements can be achieved, we will deliver them through further software updates.\nApple launched a free repair program for iPhone 6s units within certain serial number ranges, but it now appears that these may not be the only ones affected.\nThe repair program followed shortly after another one for iPhone 6 Plus models suffering from \u2018Touch Disease.\u2019 In that case, Apple said the issue was caused by impact damage, and that customers would be required to pay a flat fee for repairs.\nVia Gizmodo.

        "body": "Yesterday Consumer Reports revealed that Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro became the first MacBook to fail to achieve a recommendation due to inconsistent battery life. Apple SVP Phil Schiller today tweeted that the Cupertino company is working with Consumer Reports to understand the battery tests.\n\"Working with [Consumer Reports] to understand their battery tests, \" Schiller tweeted. \"Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data.\" Apple claims its internal testing has seen the new MacBook Pro providing up to 10 hours of battery life when watching iTunes movies or browsing the web.\nWorking with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data. https://t.co/IWtfsmBwpO \u2014 Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 24, 2016\nConsumer Reports' test has come under scrutiny since publication of the non-recommendation. The tests were conducted by opening a series of 10 web pages sequentially on Safari. This tests' inconsistency had the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar registering 16 hours, 12.75 hours and 3.75 hours of battery life. A 15-inch MacBook Pro ranged from 18.5 hours to 8 hours of battery life.\nWhen Consumer Reports tried the test with Chrome rather than Safari, it found consistently high battery life. \"For this exercise, we ran two trials on each of the laptops, and found battery life to be consistently high on all six runs,\" the report said. Consumer Reports did not think it was enough data to draw a conclusion, though they also point out their test results only take default browsers into consideration.\nCritics, like iMore's Rene Ritchie, argue that inconsistent test results require more testing to ferret out whether the issue is easily fixable, like a Safari glitch. Consumer Reports noted in its report that if Apple issues a software update that it claims will fix battery life inconsistency, they will conduct fresh tests.",
