        "title": "iPhone protected you from Facebook call scraping. Android, not so much.",
        "body": "When you think there's something lurking in the dark, you turn on the lights. And, now that Facebook's data harvesting, hoarding, and exploitation is being lit up by the internet version of the Bat Signal, more and more problems are being discovered. Most recently: That Facebook was scraping call and SMS logs of Android phone users.\nAnd yes, this is what happens when neither your operating system nor your app care about your privacy.\nFrom ArsTechnica:\nThis past week, a New Zealand man was looking through the data Facebook had collected from him in an archive he had pulled down from the social networking site. While scanning the information Facebook had stored about his contacts, Dylan McKay discovered something distressing: Facebook also had about two years worth of phone call metadata from his Android phone, including names, phone numbers, and the length of each call made or received.\nOthers reported finding the same, and Ars was able to independently verify the data collection.\nIf you granted permission to read contacts during Facebook's installation on Android a few versions ago\u2014specifically before Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)\u2014that permission also granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. The permission structure was changed in the Android API in version 16. But Android applications could bypass this change if they were written to earlier versions of the API, so Facebook API could continue to gain access to call and SMS data by specifying an earlier Android SDK version. Google deprecated version 4.0 of the Android API in October 2017\u2014the point at which the latest call metadata in Facebook user's data was found. Apple iOS has never allowed silent access to call data.\nPeople began looking into the records because of the #DeleteFacebook movement, which followed the revelation that the Facebook data of 50 million users was abused by political data firm Cambridge Analytica.\nIt's unclear whether Facebook's tool to delete contact information would also delete the call and SMS logs. It's also unclear why this was happening, whether Facebook was intentionally scraping the information for exploitation, or whether it was an unforeseen side-effect of the contact sharing implementation. What is clear, though, is that repeated problems like this form a pattern and a pattern of problems makes negligence indistinguishable from malice.\nMore recent versions of Android should prevent this kind of data collection.\nThe salient point is, of course, that iOS never allowed it. This type of abuse was simply never possible if you used an iPhone. Apple built it that way on purpose and it protected its users from privacy violations like this before they ever happened.\nGoogle and Facebook's business model allow them to give you a lot of great, convenient services for free. Apple's business model allows them to give you great privacy protections by default.\nIf you're concerned about any of this, consider how much, if at all, and in what way you want to continue using Facebook or Android. Everything is a tradeoff. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. But for many, those cost of free-as-in-your-data is becoming too high a price to pay.",

        "title": "California to Introduce 'Right to Repair' Bill Requiring Smartphone Manufacturers to Offer Repair Info and Parts",
        "body": "California is preparing to join several other states with a new Right to Repair bill, which will require smartphone manufacturers to provide repair information, replacement parts, and diagnostic tools to product owners and independent repair shops.\nCalifornia Assemblymember Susan Talamantes Eggman this afternoon announced plans to introduce the new California Right to Repair Act. Eggman says the bill will provide consumers with the freedom to choose a repair shop of their choice.\niPhone X image via iFixit\n\"The Right to Repair Act will provide consumers with the freedom to have their electronic products and appliances fixed by a repair shop or service provider of their choice, a practice that was taken for granted a generation ago but is now becoming increasingly rare in a world of planned obsolescence,\" Eggman said.\nMark Murray, Executive Director of Californians Against Waste said smartphone manufacturers and home appliance makers are \"profiting at the expense of our environment and our pocketbooks\" while Kit Walsh, Senior Staff Attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the new bill is \"critical to protect independent repair shops and a competitive market for repair,\" which will lead to \"better service and lower prices.\"\nIn addition to California, 17 other states have already introduced similar Right to Repair legislation, including Washington, Massachusetts, Vermont, New York, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia.\nSeveral states began introducing Right to Repair legislation early last year, and the Right to Repair movement has continued on since then, spurred by Apple's iPhone throttling controversy.\nSince last year, Apple has been lobbying against Right to Repair bills in various states, as have several other technology companies. In Nebraska, for example, Apple said approving Right to Repair would turn the state into a \"mecca for bad actors\" making it \"easy for hackers to relocate to Nebraska.\" Other arguments from tech companies and appliance manufacturers have suggested Right to Repair bills would compromise device security and safety.\nRight to Repair bills are heavily endorsed by repair outlets like iFixit, independent repair shops, and consumer advocacy groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nIn California specifically, the Right to Repair bill is particularly interesting because as Motherboard points out, there are strong repairability laws already in place. California Civil Code Section 1793.03 states that companies must offer parts for repair for at least seven years after a product is released, which is why on Apple's vintage and obsolete products list, it lists California as the sole state where consumers can continue to get repairs on vintage products.\nApple currently requires customers who have Apple products in need of repair to visit an Apple retail store, mail a product to an Apple repair facility, or visit an Apple Authorized Service Provider to receive support for their devices. Repairs from third-party repair shops that are not Apple Authorized Service Providers can void a device's warranty.\nApple's current flagship iPhone, the iPhone X, earned a repairability score of 6 from repair site iFixit. Repairs on the device require a special Apple-specific screw driver, delicate cables are often in the way and are difficult to replace, and Apple's waterproofing makes repairs complicated. Other Apple products, like MacBooks, have much lower repairability scores.",

        "title": "After Cambridge Analytica scandal, publishers see Apple News as a solid alternative to being burned by Facebook, Google",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nFor years, Facebook and Google have been bleeding the publishing industry dry, appropriating the work of its reporters while replacing the ads that traditionally supported the news business with their own targeted surveillance advertising that does little to support actual journalism. It took a major scandal to wake the industry up, but it's increasing warming to Apple News and its unique model of privacy.\nThe exposure of how Cambridge Analytica was able to obtain private data on 50 million Facebook users without permission, and why Facebook did nothing for two years after finding out about the egregious misuse of the massive social graph it maintains, has awakened a \"Delete Facebook\" movement among users tired of web advertising's malicious incompetence running roughshod over any remaining notion of online privacy and digital security.\nBut it's also a wakeup call to news publishers, who have long partnered with Facebook and Google with the expectation that all of the surveillance data those advertisers collect would eventually be of benefit to publishers, rather than just continuing to take away the revenues that have historically supported journalism.\nFacebook and Google are \"built to eviscerate publishers\"\nToday, in a piece for Recode headlined, \"Google and Facebook can't help publishers because they're built to defeat publishers,\" Peter Kafka wrote, \"no matter how hard Google and Facebook try to help publishers, they will do more to hurt them, because that's the way they're supposed to work. They're built to eviscerate publishers.\"\nUnlike Facebook and Google, which rely entirely upon advertising revenue and have been working to take as much funding as possible away from their news partners, Apple developed its iOS News app with the same goal as the App Store and iTunes: to make its premium hardware more attractive and engaging to customers by surrounding it with ecosystems of valuable content from many sources.\nApple's efforts to bring valuable curation and publishing tools to online journalism have been gaining ground since the release of its News apps as part of iOS 9. Publishers can choose to work with Apple to monetize their work, or use their own ad technology. It's becoming an increasingly attractive option for news publishers as they realize what a mistake they made to partner with Facebook and Google.\nIn February, The Information published a report by Tom Dotan titled \"Inside Apple courtship of news publishers,\" noting that \"Apple News has generated half of Vox.com's daily traffic at times.\"\nThe traffic itself isn't necessarily generating revenue, but publishers are learning how to convert readership into paid subscriptions. A report by Digital Content Next cited Dave Merrell, a lead product manager at The Washington Post, as outlining Apple's iOS demographic as a particularly valuable segment of readers.\nMerrell said the Post has \"had a subscription offer in Apple News since the launch of iOS 10, and we have been pleasantly surprised by this audience's propensity to subscribe. After only a year, Apple News is a thriving subscription channel for us.\"\nHe also noted, \"Apple News traffic and subscriptions didn't just fall into our lap. We recognized the opportunity of a news platform built directly into iOS and made Apple News an integral part of our editorial processes immediately. We spent a lot of time studying the Apple News audience and their habits, and our editors watch Apple News analytics every day in order to ensure that audience is getting our best journalism.\"\nApple is actually quite well positioned to help publishers.\nApple News is secretly a powerful platform for publishers. https://t.co/1TejYBSElA \u2014 Ben Bajarin (@BenBajarin) March 21, 2018\nDavid Lee, a Silicon Valley reporter for the BBC, tweeted yesterday that Apple News is a \"Massive traffic driver for us. Particularly video.\"\nApple vs the surveillance advertisers\nApple's initial efforts to support journalists and news publishers with a digital periodical model focused on iPad was collectively jeered at by the news industry, which largely wanted to suck up unlimited data on their readers and use that to target them for new revenues in the web model they'd been adopting.\nThey generally saw Apple as standing in the way of their cherished cookies, and most refused to support a digital medium for journalism that offered less access to reader analytics and behavior than Google's surveillance ads had been offering them on the web.\nWhen iPad first shipped in 2010, news publishers were also largely wedded to the idea of using Adobe Flash to deliver a digital facsimile of their print publications. Rather than adopting Apple's model for delivering HTML5 content or building custom iOS apps (the way conventional PC software makers successfully did), major publishers including Cond Nast worked with Adobe to throw out \"something very lazy and/or desperate,\" effectively huge, unwieldy images of their magazines packaged in an app wrapper.\nWhen customers passed on paying for lazy, poorly implemented subscription-based apps that offered nothing new that couldn't already be found elsewhere, often for free, publishers complained that it was Steve Jobs' fault for not singlehandedly saving journalism on their behalf.\nApple's rough path to the News app\nIn 2011, Apple promoted \"The Daily,\" an effort to tailor news for iPad users by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Yet it was competing against, essentially, Napster-News, an endless array of legitimate (and less legitimate) news sites offering content on the web or in apps for free, generally monetized by display adverting from Google. Even at its 99 cents per week price, \"The Daily\" wasn't enough to capture enough readers' attention to sustain a newsroom of journalists working to create professional content for it.\nThe next year, Apple focused on iPad digital books to take on the textbook industry, an effort that resisted by textbook publishers as well as attacked by Amazon. Despite being the leading digital bookseller with majority market share, Amazon successfully complained to the federal government that Apple had colluded with publishers to sell ebooks priced higher than the prices it was capable of forcing publishers to sell their work for.\nApple spent several more years working on a publishing strategy for news, starting with \"Newsstand,\" a dedicated iOS folder for news-related App Store titles, with a specialized store designed to highlight subscription-based content. This too didn't gain much traction in a world where plenty of other content was available for free online, and most news apps were simply lazy wrappers for huge images of print magazines.\nCreative App Store developers, however, began working on new ways to present interactive, digital book and magazine layouts. Former Apple employees Mike Matas and Kimon Tsinteris launched Push Pop Press with the intent of facilitating the creation of dynamic books as native iOS apps.\nAfter Apple appeared interested, Facebook bought the startup in 2011 and flubbed its own execution in trying to launch the concept as Paper. It didn't launch until in 2014, and was then abandoned by Facebook after two years.\nIn 2012, a digital publisher in Netherlands, led by Michel Elings, relaunched its formerly Adobe InDesign-based TRVL publication as an iOS-native digital app with interactive features, created using a the Prss development tool it custom built for the task.\nThe slick app and the technology behind it also caught Apple's attention. It highlighted the team's work in 2012 at WWDC, and it subsequently ended up acquiring the team by the end of 2014.\nThe following year Apple released iOS 9 with a new Apple News app replacing Newsstand, with features that appear to derive from Prss. At the time, Apple also stressed that News readers' personal behaviors and recommendations would not be tracked or linked to their Apple ID.\nSince then, Apple has expanded the curation and customization of News feeds, allowing users to set up notifications for breaking news, select news sources or subjects of interest similar to the recommendation system in Apple Music, subscribe directly to publications, search for news by subject and save articles for reading offline later.\nApple News also began managing an updated Spotlight of related, trending stories of the day and has added specialized coverage for events including the recent Olympic Games (above).\nEarlier this month, Apple acquired Texture, an app that offers instant digital access to both new and legacy issues of around 200 of the most popular publications. Its unlimited access subscription model has been dubbed the \"Netflix of magazines,\" and appears to fit into Apple's increasing interest in building a content empire beyond Apple Music and iTunes Movies and Apple TV.",

        "title": "2 Out of 3 Apple Devices Ever Sold Are Still in Use - The Mac Observer",
        "body": "Two out of three Apple devices ever sold are still in use, according to Asymco. Horace Dediu arrived at this number by taking the total number of monthly active devices and comparing it to the total number of devices sold. But it\u2019s not just about the number of devices, it\u2019s also about customer satisfaction.\nThe Number\nDr. Edward Deming, a statistician, said that \u201cthe numbers that best define a company are\u2026the value of a satisfied customer and the value of a dissatisfied customer.\u201d And these numbers difficult to quantify.\nApple sends out satisfaction surveys to customers and that is what the company measures . But Horace points out that people tend to lie and say things that they judge the listener will want to hear, in an effort to be liked more.\nSo to get around that, he created a formula to chart Apple devices: S\u00f7(1+EXP(\u22121\u00d7(t\u2212o)\u00f7g)) where S is the point of saturation or maximum population size, t is the period or count of quarters (1 for Q1 2007 and 2 for Q2 2007, etc), o is the offset to 50% or the point of inflection, in quarters, and g is the growth factor. The S-curve in the chart corresponds to S=1.8 billion, o=35 and g=8.\nOnce you have an estimate of the active device (user) base size, you can use to to predict units sold and revenue. The conclusion is the ratio between cumulative units and active units, which gives us the number 64%. This is the percentage behind the \u201c2 out of 3 Apple devices sold are still in use\u201d rule of thumb.\nThis is the number you use to predict Apple\u2019s business. It\u2019s a better satisfaction measurement than surveys, because raw data doesn\u2019t lie. And presumably you can chart this into the future to make predictions, which is what good science is about.",

        "body": "Apple ($AAPL) hiring trend data suggests that the company is finally taking its Siri intelligent assistant seriously. According to hiring data that we track at Thinknum, the number of open positions that contain the term \"Siri\" has accelerated in recent weeks, with a current all-time high of 161 job listings posted today alone. This marks a jump in hiring for the keyword of 24% in just over a month.\nAs you see in the chart above, hiring for Siri-focused positions accelerated in mid-February. The hiring trend has been on an upward trajectory since summer 2016, but only recently did the openings spike so acutely.\nApple has come under fire of late for Siri's lagging intelligence, especially when compared to her competitors at Amazon and Google.\nThe job openings are largely based at Apple's new headquarters in the Santa Clara Valley.

Category Unique ID (Count) Software Engineering 154 Design 1 Product Management 3 Information Systems and Technology 3\nAs for patterns in the job titles, the most common title is \"Siri - Software Engineer\", of which there are 5 positions. With three positions, \"Siri - iOS Engineer\" has three replicated openings. The rest is a smattering of engineering skillsets, from Infrastructure Engineers, to Machine Learning Engineers, to Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engineers.\nSending Siri to School\nIt's easy to see that this is a concerted effort by Apple to make Siri smart. Or, at least, smarter than she has been. It's no secret that Siri is perceived as lagging behind her competing AI cousins at Amazon (Alexa), Google (Google Assitant), and Microsoft (Cortana). While the other assistants are picking up new skills on a daily basis (Alexa Skills and Google Actions are massive, growing categories), Siri is still struggling to take notes and turn off lights. When Apple released the long-awaited HomePod, critics praised the speaker's sound quality but unanimously called it crippled by Siri's lack of smarts.\nIt's clear from our hiring data trail that Apple knows where it needs to improve.\n\"Hey Siri - get your learn on,\" the company appears to be saying. In this case, the tutors are software engineers.\nAd placeholder",

The pen tool draws a small line whereas the marker has thicker strokes, bigger and wider.\nIntuitively, I think the marker is the obvious choice to cover up some text. It takes less strokes to write over a region simply because it\u2019s larger. However, the marker is actually slightly transparent. If you do only one coat, this is obvious. If you do two or three coats, the human eye just sees solid color, and it is reasonable to believe that the content underneath is lost.\nThis is not true regardless of whether you do one brush stroke with the marker (which is easily transparent) or multiple (when it appears to be solid).\nThis is the \u2018problem\u2019 with trying to use Markup for redaction. Whilst it looks like the content is covered up, you only need to take the picture into a photo editor and lighten the image.\nI used Pixelmator Pro and adjusted two sliders in Color Adjustments to instantly reveal what was underneath. If you redact with a white marker, you can darken instead of lighten and the text underneath is very much readable.\nIn both of these examples below, it is trivial to find out who really took the picture (this is a random image I found online, don\u2019t actually attribute it to me):\nYou can see another example in the header image of this post with black text on a white background, and the black Markup marker. You don\u2019t necessarily need a third-party app to do this either; often you can reveal it just as easily using the Photos app built-in light adjustment controls.\nThis isn\u2019t just a theoretical issue. I was prompted to write this up because of a recent Reddit thread where the poster had used the iOS Markup feature on a screenshot of a wedding invite to cover up the names of the people involved and the address of the event. However, the comments were quickly flooded with the real names and location, from people spending five seconds in Photoshop.\nThis isn\u2019t really a bug or flaw as iOS Markup is not designed for censoring sensitive information, it\u2019s just easy to confuse it for something that does. The pen tool is not susceptible because it does draw truly opaque strokes but it\u2019s inconvenient because the size of the brush is so much smaller. If you really have to, use the pen tool (the first one in the row) not the marker. Update: It is possible to add a rectangle shape with a solid color. Tap the +, select Square, position, and then tap the options button and change the style from outline to a filled in shape. This works fine, and not susceptible to the marker transparency issues, although it is quite buried in the interface.\nThe real solution is to use an actual app meant for this task, like Redacted on iOS and Mac. There are plenty of lightweight App Store utilities for quickly annotating and redacting screenshots. For what it\u2019s worth, it would be nice if Apple added an actual redact tool into iOS Markup in future software updates.\nThere you have it. Nothing to start a #gate over. Just a little heads up.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "body": "A new report from Digitimes citing supply chain sources indicates that Android phone makers are \u2018rushing\u2019 to implement fingerprint sensors under the display for upcoming handsets.\nAndroid manufacturers have decided that recreating the 3D facial recognition used by iPhone X is simply too costly to include, and are instead focusing on implementing Qualcomm\u2019s ultrasonic fingerprint scanners.\nThe report says that including an Infrared depth-sensing facial recognition system like the iPhone X is simply too expensive for Android smartphones to offer, which cannot command the same price premiums as Apple\u2019s iPhones.\nThis is a combination of hardware and software development costs. Digitimes claims the cost of the TrueDepth 3D sensors in iPhone X peaked at $60 per unit, an incredibly high proportion of the overall phone cost if accurate.\nAndroid makers are also worried about possible patent infringement from adopting Infrared dot projector systems. Instead, they have turned to in-display fingerprint sensors as their next-generation of device authentication.\nThis depends on using Qualcomm technology for ultrasonic-based fingerprint scanners, which can sit below the cover glass and work even if fingers are wet or greasy. The Huawei Mate 11 may be the first mass-market product to debut with the feature, expected in the second half of 2018 although the device is unlikely to be released in the US market.\nApple was rumored to be exploring in-screen Touch ID options for the iPhone X, but obviously abandoned the feature in development. Apple execs have said that Touch ID was never on the table for the iPhone X, and that they were \u2018all in\u2019 on facial recognition.\nApple\u2019s 2018 iPhone lineup is reported to bring Face ID across all three of the new models, eschewing the physical Touch ID home button for good.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "It's 2018 and Android phones still can't compare to the iPhone's Taptic Engine",
        "body": "You've probably heard of Apple's Taptic Engine before. It's the vibration motor that first appeared on the iPhone 6S, eventually running out the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 and consequent models. It's also what allowed Apple to replicate the clicking button of the old days on newer iPhones with nothing more than a firm buzz under a pressure-sensitive portion of the glass. Subtle as it may be, the Taptic Engine has made a huge difference in the overall experience of using an iPhone.\nMeanwhile, Android phones haven't exactly made haptic feedback a high priority, with most phones limited to only a few different settings for vibration intensity. Most users probably don't notice the difference, largely because they've likely never experienced the iPhone's Taptic Engine, but spending even a few hours with a modern iPhone can make it hard to go back to the rattly motors of most Android phones.\nWhat's so great about the Taptic Engine?\nRemember that HTC phone you used to have that sounded like it was going to explode every time you got a notification? Remember getting scared half to death because you left your phone on the table and the vibrations practically shook the entire room?\nThe Taptic Engine focuses on more subtle and focused vibrations. Unlike a lot of other phones, the iPhone doesn't aggressively alert you of a new text or email; it's more like a tap or a knock in your hands. But the Taptic Engine isn't special just because it's gentle; it's because nearly every interaction with it is different.\nThanks to the Taptic Engine, getting a text won't cause an earthquake with your iPhone.\nWhen you get a text, the iPhone vibrates along with your notification tone, matching the dynamics with softer and harder pulses. Same goes for phone calls \u2014 you can really take advantage of this by setting different ringtones for certain callers. Even with the phone set on vibrate, you can literally feel who's calling.\nThe Taptic Engine works great alongside the iPhone's 3D Touch display, as well. As I mentioned before, the non-moving home button on newer iPhones (save for the iPhone X, which eliminates the home button entirely) is just a pressure-sensitive portion of the front glass. The \"click\" is emulated by the Taptic Engine, and you can adjust how hard you need to press down \u2014 and how strongly it vibrates back at you \u2014 in the settings.\nYou can also feel the effects of 3D Touch and the Taptic Engine on the home screen and throughout the UI; pressing an icon on your home screen with a bit of force will prompt a small buzz and open a contextual menu for the corresponding app. Similarly, you can 3D Touch a module in Control Center to open additional options \u2014 again, with a light haptic response.\nThe Taptic Engine isn't great because of any one feature; it's a series of nuanced interactions that make the iPhone more enjoyable to use.\nWhich Android phones get the closest?\nI've seen a lot of people clamor over the great haptic feedback on the Pixel 2, and it's certainly better than that of any Pixel or Nexus before it. But after buying a Pixel 2, along with an iPhone X, earlier this month (for my fiancee and myself, respectively) and using both side by side ... let's be honest, it's not even close. It doesn't feel rattly like other Android phones, which is a huge plus, but there's really no correspondence between the vibration motor and the different actions on your phone.\nThe LG V30 has the best haptic response of any Android phone I've tried, and it's not even close.\nLG gets a lot closer to greatness with its HD TouchSense technology on the V30. Rather than using the same two or three vibration settings throughout the entire UI, LG spent some time configuring parts of its software to exhibit small details in the haptic feedback, much like on the iPhone. Pressing one of the navigation keys feels nice, with a quick tap-like response, but the best showcase of the V30's high-quality actuator is the camera software.\nIf you personally carry a V30, you already know what I'm talking about. Tapping the shutter button to take a photo actually sort of feels like taking a photo with a real camera because the button clicks back at you. If you dive into manual controls, scrolling lists will click back at you as if you were spinning a dial. It's one of my favorite uses of what LG calls \"HD haptics,\" and something even the iPhone doesn't do, because, well \u2014 the camera doesn't have manual controls.\nWhen I was formulating this article, my colleague Daniel Bader mentioned that Sony's newly announced Xperia XZ2 has some pretty great haptics of its own, and while I haven't yet tried it for myself, it definitely has my interest. In short, the \"Dynamic Vibration System,\" as Sony likes to call it, uses a larger than normal vibration motor and buzzes along with movies and music. Unfortunately, Daniel also says that Sony's motor isn't as accurate as that of the V30 or iPhone X in general, but it's a step in the right direction.\nIs it really that big a deal?\nIf you're coming away from this article thinking \"it doesn't matter that much,\" I don't blame you. Haptic feedback will vary in importance from person to person, but it's hard to imagine calling poor haptics a deal-breaker on an otherwise attractive phone.\nStill, the more I use the iPhone X it's becoming increasingly noticeable when I pick up another phone and feel just how far behind other vibration motors are. I sincerely hope LG continues to integrate its fantastic TouchSense system, and hopefully other OEMs will soon follow suit.\nWhat are your thoughts and experiences with haptic feedback, Taptic or otherwise?

        "title": "Apple AirPods: the audiophile review - A fantastic article that proves even people who regularly use high end headphones can recognize the brilliance of AirPods",
        "body": "As The Verge\u2019s resident headphones obsessive, I\u2019m not supposed to like the AirPods. My initial reaction upon first seeing them many months ago was to pour scorn on Apple\u2019s designers for crafting a pair of expensive and easy-to-lose cigarette butts. The AirPods were the resurrection of the awful Bluetooth headsets of years past, I thought. But this year, I finally got around to testing a pair of the AirPods for myself, and I finally understand why everyone who owns them loves them.\nTaking the AirPods seriously hasn\u2019t been easy for me. I spend my days attached to large and pricey headphones like the exceptional Audeze MX4 because my priorities are heavily skewed in favor of maximizing sound quality over convenience. Convenience for audiophiles is a pair of cans that don\u2019t require a toaster-sized amplifier. So when I first cast eyes on the AirPods, all glossy, frail, and vanishingly small, I had no faith that they\u2019d sound good enough to justify their $159 price. Hearing they were just like the EarPods didn\u2019t fill me with confidence either.\nSo much more than just wireless EarPods\nBut here\u2019s the thing: using the AirPods isn\u2019t merely a \u201cwireless EarPods\u201d experience. Or rather, there are surprising aspects to making the EarPods wireless that I didn\u2019t appreciate until I used the AirPods. My impression of the EarPods has always been colored by how loosely they sat in my ears. The merest tug or tension on their wire would unseat them. Well, without a wire, that entire issue is obviated, and moreover, the stem of the AirPods sits flush with the side of my face and helps to anchor them in place. I have run with the AirPods, I\u2019ve done push-ups, lifted weights, and moved around vigorously without either one coming close to falling out. Your mileage will, of course, vary, but I can\u2019t say the same about Google\u2019s Pixel Buds or the majority of other earbuds on the market, wired or wireless.\nBecause the AirPods are so much more comfortable for me, I find their sound is also more dynamic and emotive than anything I\u2019ve heard from the EarPods. Apple isn\u2019t threatening any hi-fi audio companies (yet), but I think that both it and Google have figured out a new class of high-enough-fi for audio products that appeal with strengths other than sound quality. The Google Home Mini and Pixel Buds also sound extremely decent for their compact dimensions.\nApple\u2019s sound is good enough for most people, myself included\nThe AirPods convey a full sense of the mood and intent of the music I listen to. By that, I mean that they\u2019re not technically spectacular. They don\u2019t fill my world with a sparkling shimmer when listening to \u201cRachel\u2019s Song\u201d on the Vangelis Blade Runner soundtrack, but they still put me in that longing, wistful mood. Similarly, the AirPods\u2019 bass doesn\u2019t make my world shake, but it still hits with surprising impact on songs like Woodkid\u2019s \u201cIron.\u201d There\u2019s enough of everything \u2014 bass and treble extension, soundstage, clarity, and detail \u2014 in Apple\u2019s tuning to render a convincing reproduction of most genres of music.\nI say the AirPods aren\u2019t technically amazing, but that\u2019s only when comparing against existing standards for sound quality. In the category of truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods are the best I\u2019ve yet heard. Bragi\u2019s The Headphone and Dash Pro left me underwhelmed, with the latter being especially bloated and disfigured by an overabundance of bass. At CES this year, Jabra introduced the Elite 65t, which sound good, but I can\u2019t listen to them for longer than 15 seconds without the wireless connection dropping out.\nApple\u2019s AirPods design, which I initially ridiculed, is actually the best and most functional one available for truly wireless buds today. Because Apple moved the Bluetooth electronics and batteries to the stem, it was able to use the full cavity of each bud for sound reproduction. That\u2019s how the AirPods reproduce a wider soundstage than most Bluetooth earbuds without being any thicker or protruding from the ear. For a counterexample, you can try listening to the Jaybird X3s, which are very well tuned, but everything inside them sounds condensed like a closed accordion because of how close the sound driver is to the listener\u2019s ear. Apple\u2019s design compromise, extending that stem down toward the face, is simply the most optimal one we have at the present time. Yes, the AirPods are designed for function first, in spite of their stylized appearance.\nThe AirPods work brilliantly with Android devices, too\nI started testing the AirPods alongside the iPhone X a few weeks ago, and the seamless pairing between the two is just as wonderful as advertised. But I\u2019ve now spent the last two weeks using the AirPods with a Google Pixel 2, and that\u2019s been entirely unproblematic, too. The only missing features on Android are the auto-pause and the battery life indicator on the phone \u2014 neither of which I miss. Maintaining a consistent and reliable Bluetooth connection, the thing I actually care about, is still sadly uncommon among truly wireless buds, so Apple\u2019s wireless earphones are easy to recommend even to Android phone users.\nMy wireless-doom scenario is walking into my kitchen, which is so full of metal things that it\u2019s like a Faraday cage, while leaving my music source device in the bedroom: every non-Apple pair of wireless headphones I test becomes unusable in that situation. With the AirPods (and the Beats Solo and Studio 3, which have the same W1 wireless chip) connected to my MacBook Pro, I maintained a pretty decent connection with only minor dropouts in the kitchen.\nThe design of the AirPods case is a total masterpiece. It\u2019s tiny but holds multiple extra charges for the earphones, and the rounded sides make them irresistible fidget toys. The tension of the case lid is perfect, delivering a satisfying snap when it opens and closes. When I was trying out the Elite 65t, by contrast, I managed to chip a nail trying to open their (similarly shaped, but infinitely more finicky) case. Anyone who\u2019s used the AirPods will know the experience of absent-mindedly opening and closing their case for minutes at a time. It\u2019s subtly great design, where both form and function are served to the utmost degree.\nThe price is fair and the compromises are acceptable\nThe AirPods still come with substantial compromises. They don\u2019t isolate external sound at all, and so you can carry on a conversation with someone next to you without ever taking them out. That renders the AirPods difficult to use for noisy urban commutes (where you\u2019re likely crank up the volume to unsafe levels to compensate), and it also leads to people just leaving them in at all times, which is irritating to others. The four-hour battery life on a single charge isn\u2019t great. The $159 price is higher than most people are happy to spend on earphones for uncritical daily listening. And that Lightning charger totally spoils the USB-C hegemony of my current tech loadout.\nBut when I look at the limits of what\u2019s possible today \u2014 in terms of miniaturization of audio and wireless components \u2014 I can\u2019t see a better combination of price, features, and performance than what\u2019s offered by the AirPods. The price is fair and the compromises are acceptable. I make it my job to review (and enjoy) super heavy and expensive headphones that do amazing things with music, recreating and illuminating every minute detail of a recording. That makes me extremely picky about any products I listen to, and the thing the AirPods share with the giant cans built by the likes of Audeze and Focal is that they convey the sense and intent of the music. And the reason I now reach for the AirPods even when I\u2019m at home, the unique thing that delights all their users, is their unrivalled ease of use.",

Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nAt the China Development Forum this weekend, Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke about Facebook's misuse of customer data, and sounded the call for stricter rules across the board on what companies are allowed to do with harvested information.\nFirst reported by Bloomberg on early Saturday morning, Cook was asked at a discussion about the Cambridge Analytica debacle, and if the use of consumer data should be dialed back as a result.\n\"I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,\" said Cook. \"The ability of anyone to know what you've been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view it shouldn't exist.\"\nCook noted that Apple had been aware of the possibility of misuse of consumer data for a long time.\n\"We've worried for a number of years that people in many countries were giving up data probably without knowing fully what they were doing and that these detailed profiles that were being built of them,\" added Cook. \"That one day, something would occur and people would be incredibly offended by what had been done without them being aware of it. Unfortunately that prediction has come true more than once.\"\nCook has notably in the past obliquely referred to companies' use of consumer data, noting that if a product was free, then the consumer \u2014 and all associated data \u2014 was the product paying for the service.\nThe FTC is probing Facebook following the revelation that the UK-based Cambridge Analytica acquired the data of as many as 50 million Facebook users, reports Bloomberg, which may have been misused to influence a number of political events world-wide.\nIn a post on March 21, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained that Aleksandr Kogan, the researcher at the center of the scandal, had accessed data of 300,000 Facebook users with permission when he created a personality quiz back in 2013. In doing so, the users who took the poll gave up information on millions of connections without their permission with an academic account, and not a commercial one.\nKogan shared that harvested data with Cambridge Analytica, with some debate over whether or not Cambridge Analytica deleted the data even after promising Facebook that it had done so.\nIn the wake of the revelations, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica and parent company Strategic Communications Laboratories for violating the site's Terms of Service, specifically rules about the collection and retention of data.\nCook also spoke out in the wake of a series of hacks in 2014, and detailed Apple's stance on user data and privacy.",

        "body": "It seems that it\u2019s not just in benchmarks that Samsung\u2019s new flagship Galaxy S9 is failing to keep up with the iPhone \u2013 the same seems to be true of its new Intelligent Scan face unlock system \u2026\nSamsung\u2019s early attempts at face-recognition were embarrassingly bad. Both the Galaxy S8 and Note 8 were quickly shown to be defeated by photos and video. The company even tacitly admitted the security failings by not allowing face-recognition to be used for its Apple Pay competitor, Samsung Pay.\nWhile Samsung is touting what is ostensibly a smarter version of face unlock in the Galaxy S9, it seems the system is simply faster, rather than more secure.\nCNET reports that the S9 appears to first try the same low-security 2D face recognition system used in earlier devices, then attempt an iris scan if that doesn\u2019t work, and finally combine the two if neither is successful on its own. The result is that unlock is quicker and more reliable, but no more secure.\nOne security researcher believes Samsung was trying to match the speed, rather than security, of Face ID.\n\u201cThey want to provide some level of security but also make it easy and effective for you to get into the phone,\u201d said Andrew Blaich, a researcher with mobile security company Lookout. \u201cThis is probably trying to play catchup with how smooth the user experience is for the iPhone.\u201d\nThe security researcher who successfully defeated the iris scanner in the Galaxy S8 says he can\u2019t even see the sport in doing it again with the S9.\nJan Krissler, a security researcher known as \u201cStarbug\u201d with the hacking group Computer Chaos Club, exposed the Galaxy S8\u2019s weaknesses last May when he fooled Iris Scan with a photo and contact lens. He said his group\u2019s not interested in trying to crack Intelligent Scan if there\u2019s nothing new. \u201cThere is no fun in hacking just a new release of the same system,\u201d Krissler said in an email.\nAnd Samsung, once again, doesn\u2019t allow Intelligent Scan to be used with Samsung Pay, seemingly confirming its own view of the level of security offered.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "body": "Apple's second-generation iPhone X and so-called iPhone X Plus could be priced from $899 and $999 respectively in the United States, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani.\niPhone X and iPhone X Plus dummy models via Ben Geskin\nDaryanani said the current iPhone X has experienced \"limited success\" at $999 and up, leading him to believe that lowering the base price by $100 could reinvigorate sales of the 5.8-inch model. A widely rumored 6.5-inch model, dubbed iPhone X Plus, would then fill the $999 price point.\nWhile this is merely a prediction from one analyst, the strategy could make sense if iPhone X sales have slowed significantly, as a series of supply chain reports have suggested. We won't know for sure until Apple's next earnings report, likely to be released around late April or early May.\nAt this point, all we know is that the iPhone X was likely a key contributor to Apple's record-breaking revenue of $88.3 billion last quarter, easily topping its previous all-time high of $78.4 billion set in the year-ago quarter. Whether that momentum carried forward to the current quarter remains to be seen.\nBased on Daryanani's research note, obtained by MacRumors, here's our take on how the next iPhone lineup could look in terms of pricing:\n6.5-inch second-generation iPhone X Plus: $999\n5.8-inch second-generation iPhone X: $899\n6.1-inch mid-range iPhone X with LCD: $799\niPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: $549 and $669\niPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: $449 and $569\niPhone SE: $349\nHere's a rough idea of how the next iPhone lineup could look if Apple maintains its current pricing strategy instead:\n6.5-inch second-generation iPhone X Plus: $1,099\n5.8-inch second-generation iPhone X: $999\n6.1-inch mid-range iPhone X with LCD: $799\niPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: $549 and $669\niPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: $449 and $569\niPhone SE: $349\nApple will likely unveil its next iPhones in September as usual, and presumably only the company's top executives are privy to pricing plans.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nA subsidiary of longtime Apple supply partner Foxconn on Monday announced the acquisition of popular accessory maker Belkin, which also owns Linksys, Phyn and Wemo brands, for approximately $866 million.\nFoxconn Interconnect Technology Limited and Belkin revealed the move in a joint statement published to Belkin's website, saying the acquisition will be accomplished in an all-cash deal.\n\"FIT is excited to acquire Belkin and its capabilities in the premium consumer products space,\" said Sidney Lu, CEO of FIT. \"Integrating Belkin's best-in-class capabilities and solutions into FIT, we expect to enrich our portfolio of premium consumer products and accelerate our penetration into the smart home.\"\nBelkin was founded in California some 35 years ago, subsequently making a name for itself as a quality peripheral manufacturer during the personal computing boom. Starting with an assortment of add-on devices like surge protectors, USB hubs and, of course, cables, Belkin went on to capitalize on Apple's renaissance with iPod products in the early 2000s.\nCurrently, the company produces a range of goods serving owners of computers, smartphones, tablets, smartwatches and other electronics. Belkin addresses the burgeoning connected home segment with a separate brand called Wemo.\nIn 2013, Belkin entered the networking hardware business with the purchase of Linksys, bringing the former Cisco entity and manufacturer of routers, switches and other equipment into the fold.\nMost recently, Belkin and plumbing supplier Uponor in 2016 partnered to establish new company called Phyn. The firm's first product, an iPhone-connected water monitoring device dubbed Phyn Plus, debuted at CES earlier this year.\nUnder terms of the agreement with Foxconn, Belkin will continue to operate as a subsidiary of FIT with CEO and founder Chet Pipkin at the helm. Pipkin is expected to join FIT's management team as part of the arrangement.\nAccording to the Financial Times, the merger must be approved by the U.S. Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investment, which recently took exception to chipmaker Broadcom's hostile pursuit of rival Qualcomm.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nAccount credentials for Apple's online services are being sold by online scammers for an average of $15.39, a report into stolen account sales on the 'dark web' reveals, but despite the seemingly low cost, Apple-based accounts appear to be priced more than individual user accounts for a considerable number of other online destinations.\nA person's entire online identity can be worth less than $1,200 to online criminals, according to research by VPN comparison site Top10VPN into the secretive online markets. The firm's Dark Web Market Price Index for February 2018 shows there to be a wide difference in price for account credentials, ranging from the hundreds of dollars for finance-related services down to sub-dollar accounts.\nApple's $15.39 price on the list indicates it to be one of the more valuable offerings outside of the expected high-ticket listings. It is likely the use of the same account across Apple's various digital storefronts, as well as access to the Apple Music streaming service and the potential personal data archive on iCloud, makes it a potentially more attractive account type to acquire than others with fewer uses.\nThe list puts Apple against other \"Entertainment Logins,\" which typically provide access to online content services. Compared to the $15 of Apple, Netflix is its nearest competitor in the category at $8.32, followed by Twitch at $2.08 and Ticketmaster at $2.07.\nFor social media accounts, Facebook is seen to be the most valuable at $5.20 per account, with LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram following at $2.07, $1.66, and $1.28 respectively.\nCredentials for email accounts, usually treated as a main attack vector for other online services due to the high amount of personal information available to attackers, are worth even less. The popular Gmail and Yahoo accounts typically sell for just $1.04 each, while oddly AOL is the most expensive account in the category to acquire at $4.16.\nNotably, Apple accounts also sell for more than credentials for accounts managed by major telecommunications firms in the U.S. The top end of the category lists Verizon at $15, followed by AT&T for $14.64, T-Mobile accounts at $10.51, and Rogers at $10.39, while Xfinity accounts fetch just $1.77 each.\nNone of the online shopping logins beat Apple either, though Macys is closest at $15.34 per account, with eBay and Amazon lagging behind at $12.48 and $9 respectively.\nAt the top end of the scale are financial services, topped by working PayPal logins selling for $247 per account and Western Union logins for $101. Online banking, debit card, and credit card details fetch $160.15, $67.50, and $50 in turn.\nProof of a person's identity, such as scans of utility bills or other forms providing sensitive details that could be used for scams, are traded for an average of $29.59, while passport scans are more expensive at $62.61 each.\nThe report was compiled by analyzing thousands of listings for stolen identification, hacked accounts, and personal information relevant to U.S. users that surfaced on three of the most popular dark web marketplaces. Relevant listings were categorized and combined to create average sale prices.\nThe price of each type varies depending on a number of factors, including funds available in accounts, the ease of accessing information that can be used in potentially more lucrative ways, and the ability to hijack the account for scams and other uses. Bundles containing large swathes of sensitive details about individuals are also popular on these markets.",

        "body": "Apple takes a very un-tech approach to solving fake news: human editors\nShow Caption Hide Caption 3 big things Apple may soon unveil For those of us who have just about every Apple gadget available from iPhones to Macbooks, you might want to pay attention. Buzz60\nWe all agree there's too much disinformation on the Web.\nRussians and bots played havoc with Fakebook and Twitter during the 2016 election, because nearly anyone can join and post on social media networks and much of the ad-buying is automated.\nThis week Apple said it was serious about tackling the issue, and bought a magazine subscription app with popular titles (including Consumer Reports, Vanity Fair and the New Yorker) to beef up its News smartphone and tablet app.\nMeanwhile the YouTube video network, fighting a backlash against conspiracy videos that anyone can post to its platform, went in a totally different direction to battle fakeness\u2014turning to crowd-sourced Wikipedia to provide viewers with links to what it hopes are authoritative viewpoints.\nLet's take a look at the two approaches.\nApple's News app is on the front page of every iPhone and iPad, and promises to give users a curated, personalized view of the news, with bigger pictures and fonts than seen when reading stories in apps or on the Safari browser. Apple said in 2016 the News app had over 70 million users, and while it hasn't updated the numbers, it does say the app has grown substantially since.\nAt the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas this week, Apple senior vice-president Eddy Cue said his app is differentiated from what we see on Facebook and Twitter in that it's vetted by human curators and thus, more authentic.\n\"We want the best articles, we want them to look amazing and we want them to be from trusted sources,\u201d Cue said, per Deadline. \u201cSo we don\u2019t have a lot of the issues going around.\u201d\nOn Apple News, publishers big and small can sign up to have their work included in the app, for free. But unlike on Facebook, on News, would-be publishers need to submit at least three articles to Apple before being approved.\nNot so at YouTube, where some 400 hours of video is uploaded every minute, without prior oversight\nThe video network has been caught in a two-year battle against conspiracy and extremist videos showing up as legitimate news videos, and it has taken several steps to fix the issue, by de-monetizing them and removing their ads, and now, also at South by Southwest, in announcing a new strategy.\nYouTube will add links from the crowd-sourced Wikipedia online encyclopedia to conspiracy videos. If you're scratching your head on this, so are we.\nWikipedia is even easier to game than the YouTube algorithm. Anyone can edit a post and add their spin to it \u2014whether that be the biography of President Donald Trump, the history of the Santa Monica Pier or a post about the blogger Lance Ulanoff.\nThe longtime tech journalist woke up one morning and found that his listing has been updated, falsely, to say that he was \"a member of the French Foreign Legion.\"\nIt eventually got updated, but Ulanoff doesn't think YouTube will find much success with its Wikipedia fix.\n\"It will be like a band-aid that will work at first, and within a few days it will be tattered and dirty,\" he says.\nThe problem, he notes, is that once Wikipedia is used to verify the bogus videos on YouTube, those same people who make and post the videos will descend upon Wikipedia to synch the facts with their point of view, he says. \"It's a very slippery slope.\"\nThe bottom line: kudos to Apple for a terrific app that has so far not experienced the issues found on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, and for the video network \u2014nice idea, but it's back to the drawing board. Next?\nFlippy lessons - the future won't be here overnight Flippy, the burger flipping robot only lasted two days before the plug was pulled, temporarily, suggesting that the future we dream about is going to take a whole lot longer to arrive. Jefferson Graham explains on #TalkingTech USA TODAY\nMeanwhile, in other tech news of the week:\nThe Grocery Wars: Retail giant Walmart said it would have same-day food delivery available in 100 markets by the end of the year, joining Target and Amazon-owned Whole Foods, which have made the same predictions.\nDon't get singer Rihanna mad at you.

        "title": "Apple, everyone needs more free iCloud storage",
        "body": "During yesterday\u2019s education-focused event that saw the introduction of a new iPad, Apple executive Greg Joswiak revealed that the company is upgrading the amount of free iCloud storage given to students. Previously, managed student accounts had the same 5GB as regular consumers, but now, Apple is raising that limit to a much more spacious 200GB. This applies to students who have Apple IDs provided and administered by their school.\nThat\u2019s a great thing! Apple is displaying a focused, determined approach to providing educators with powerful new hardware and improved classroom software and services. 200GB is an enormous amount of runway for collaboration and creation among students.\nBut why shouldn\u2019t people shelling out hundreds of dollars for an iPhone or iPad have a similar, worry-free chunk of storage in the cloud for their photos, documents, message history, and other precious content? Apple charges consumers $2.99 per month for that same 200GB allotment (which can be shared between family members), so you\u2019d be paying just shy of $36 annually. That\u2019s not much, but it continues to feel like ill-disguised penny pinching from the world\u2019s biggest and richest tech company. In January, John Gruber said the included allotment of 5GB \u201cseems ridiculous\u201d when it comes alongside a 64GB device. If you\u2019ve got a 256GB iPhone or 512GB iPad, it becomes even more unreasonable.\nApple has stuck with 5GB of free cloud storage since iCloud was introduced nearly seven years ago.\nThe 5GB limit has been in place since Apple unveiled iCloud at WWDC 2011. It\u2019s been almost seven years! That\u2019s too long to be stuck in place, and it\u2019s reminiscent of the way Apple dragged its feet in moving away from 16GB iPhones. It eventually happened, but long after many of us had determined 16GB to be an unworkable amount of space.\nA lot of people (most?) buy the base-level iPhone, so Apple\u2019s decision on how much storage goes inside is a critical choice. And the same holds true for iCloud; I\u2019d wager that most customers never upgrade from the free tier. They just won\u2019t give in, whether it\u2019s out of principle or because they\u2019re sensibly trying to avoid yet another monthly charge in their lives.\n5GB makes things way more difficult for those people than they should be. Fundamental tasks like backing up your device become cumbersome chores. If you never upgrade, you\u2019re likely going to have a worse time using an iPhone. Full stop. It surprises me that Apple continues to let that fly.\nAlso disappointing is that the paid tiers have continued to increase in capacity over time, but the free allotment hasn't budged even once.\nAnd despite Apple\u2019s best efforts (like the video above) to explain how you can manage iCloud, customers are inevitably confused, frustrated, and annoyed when they hit the ceiling. It usually happens well before they approach the limits of their iPhone or iPad\u2019s physical storage, and that disconnect between the two only makes things more irritating.\nThe most effective ad that Google has ever made for Google Photos was aimed at the dread of seeing Apple\u2019s \u201cnot enough storage\u201d message pop up on your iPhone\u2019s screen. It works because it\u2019s a thing that millions of people have experienced. Joanna Stern likens the message to a ransom note; you\u2019d better pay up if you want to keep all that data safe.\nApple\u2019s ideal scenario involves you continuing through those prompts and upgrading to a higher tier of monthly iCloud space in seconds. And sure, maybe that\u2019s an inevitability if you\u2019re storing years of photos in the cloud. Apple has no obligation to give you a free digital locker for everything. Buying an expensive gadget doesn\u2019t somehow make us entitled to that. But people are hitting this wall way, way too soon in their experience with an iPhone or iPad.\nFor context, let\u2019s look at what you get on Android:\nGoogle: 15GB of free cloud storage with Google Drive, unlimited photo backup with Google Photos at \u201coptimized\u201d quality. 100GB for $1.99 / month, 1TB for $9.99 / month, or 10TB for $99.99 / month.\nSamsung: Samsung Cloud, the iCloud equivalent for Galaxy S and Note smartphones, also offers 15GB of storage to start out. 50GB is $0.99 / month, and 200GB matches Apple\u2019s monthly price of $2.99.\nSo 15GB is the baseline for Apple\u2019s competitors. That still feels insufficient, but it\u2019s a big enough increase to make a difference when it might count.\nI\u2019m hopeful yesterday\u2019s announcement for schools was a precursor to an increase in iCloud storage for everyone at WWDC in June. Apple is long overdue to raise it up to an amount that\u2019s actually helpful for the people storing their lives and data on an iPhone. 200GB is certainly overkill for most. At the bare minimum, I think Apple should match the competition. But I\u2019d love to see the company increase free iCloud storage to 50GB, which currently costs $0.99 / month. That would be a substantial improvement and help make device backups and putting more photos in the cloud much less stressful. Keep charging for people who want hundreds of gigabytes or a terabyte of space, sure. Apple\u2019s services division is turning into a money-making machine, and iCloud upgrades certainly factor into that.\nBut the bigger the free number ultimately is, the better. Customers who\u2019ve just handed over their hard-earned money for an iPhone should be getting it anyway. We talk about iMessage, FaceTime, and other software as powerful ways of locking consumers into Apple\u2019s ecosystem. But I can think of another way to accomplish that: give customers enough free iCloud storage that the thought of one day switching to something else and moving out of Apple\u2019s cloud would seem hopelessly daunting.",

        "body": "IDC is out today with its numbers on the global sales of wearables for 2017. Without any surprise, the data shows Apple Watch on top, like we saw confirmed from other firms last month.\nIDC\u2019s report shows Apple as the global leader in wearables for Q4 2017 with 8 million units shipped. Fitbit came in a relatively distant second place with 5.4 million sales.\nApple also took the number one spot for 2017 sales overall with 17.7 million units. Xiaomi took the number two spot with 15.7 million for the year.\nThe most impressive part about Apple Watch sales is the estimated 57.5% YoY growth for the holiday quarter and 55.9% YoY growth for 2017. This data lines up with a Canalys report we saw last month and tracks with the vague details Apple shared during its last earnings call.\nApple is catching the market at the right time with many users of basic wearables moving on to smartwatches and cellular connectivity (available on select Series 3 Watches) is earning a warm reception among end users, if only for the convenience of leaving their smartphone behind. The late-year push of 8.0 million units separated Apple from the competition to emerge as the overall leader of the wearables market for the year.\nNotably, Xiaomi and Fitbit \u2013 who had the second and third most shipments \u2013 saw a -0.3% and -31.6% drop in shipments YoY for 2017. This leaves Apple Watch in prime position to dominate 2018 and beyond.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "body": "Facebook\u2019s executives have spent much of the past week dealing with the fallout of reports claiming millions of its users had their data harvested from a quiz app without their consent. CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg issued a long non-apology on Facebook, and appeared on cable news to explain how the company was responding to what he called \u201ca breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it.\u201d\nZuckerberg should have heeded what he heard from the late Steve Jobs eight years ago. Then, when the social network had a measly half-billion users, Jobs spoke at The Wall Street Journal\u2019s AllThingsD conference, where Zuckerberg was in the audience, waiting to be interviewed himself, and described what privacy meant.\nAdvertisement\nJournalist Walt Mossberg asked Jobs his thoughts on recent privacy issues around Facebook (which at the time was revamping its privacy controls after criticism it was forcing people to share data) and Google (which was literally recording private wifi information), and whether Silicon Valley looks at privacy differently than the rest of the world.\n\u201cSilicon Valley is not monolithic,\u201d Jobs responded, \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a very different view of privacy than some of our colleagues in the Valley.\u201d Apple, for instance, does not leave it up to developers to decide whether to be dutiful about warning users that their apps are tracking their location data, instead forcing pop-ups on users to alert them that an app is tracking them, and to turn off that ability if they don\u2019t want. \u201cWe do a lot of things like that, to ensure that people know what these apps are doing,\u201d he added. It\u2019s a stance his successor, Tim Cook, still holds.\nMossberg then asked Jobs if that applied to Apple\u2019s own apps in the cloud. Here\u2019s what Jobs said:\nPrivacy means people know what they\u2019re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly. I\u2019m an optimist; I believe people are smart, and some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you\u2019re going to do with their data.\nAdvertisement\nZuckerberg has faced criticisms about as long as Facebook has been around about how it handles its users\u2019 data. He apologized in 2007 when a Facebook product took user tracking too far. In 2010, he acknowledged the privacy problem again, and the company changed its settings. And in 2014. And now again in 2018. If the company had been more forthright about how developers could take data shared with them by Facebook users and sold to third parties, it may not have been in the mess it\u2019s in today.\n\u201cA lot of people in the Valley think we\u2019re really old-fashioned about this,\u201d Jobs said in the interview, \u201cAnd maybe we are, but we worry about stuff like this.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the full clip:",
