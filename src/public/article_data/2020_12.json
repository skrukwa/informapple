        "body": "Some users have noticed that Instagram is unexpectedly accessing the camera, reports The Verge.\nUsers have reported that the green \"camera on\" indicator was displayed in iOS 14 when scrolling through their feed, but not taking a photo or a video. In a statement to The Verge, a spokesperson for Instagram said that the behavior was a bug and is being fixed.\n\"We only access your camera when you tell us to \u2014 for example, when you swipe from Feed to Camera. We found and are fixing a bug in iOS 14 Beta that mistakenly indicates that some people are using the camera when they aren't,\" the spokesperson said. \"We do not access your camera in those instances, and no content is recorded.\"\nInstagram's bug is the latest in a series of unexpected app behavior controversies revealed by iOS 14's aggressive privacy notifications. iOS 14 notifies users when an app or widget pastes text from the clipboard or accesses the camera or microphone. Since the release of the iOS 14 developer and public beta, a large number of popular apps, such as LinkedIn, Reddit, and TikTok, have been discovered to be covertly accessing clipboard data.\nLast year, Instagram's parent company, Facebook, was found to be accessing the camera in the background whenever the app was in use, without the users' knowledge.",

        "title": "Apple Announces AirPods Max Over-Ear Headphones With Noise Cancellation, Priced at $549",
        "body": "Apple today introduced new wireless over-ear headphones called AirPods Max, with key features including high-fidelity audio, Adaptive EQ, Active Noise Cancellation, and spatial audio. Priced at $549, the headphones can be ordered starting today on Apple.com and in the Apple Store app, with availability beginning December 15.\nAirPods Max come in five colors, including space gray, silver, sky blue, green, and pink. Apple says the headphones feature a \"breathable knit mesh\" spanning the headband that distributes weight to reduce on-head pressure.\nApple says the ear cups have acoustically engineered memory foam to create an effective seal, and the telescoping stainless steel headband arms smoothly extend and then stay in place to maintain the desired fit on your head.\nAirPods Max feature a 40-mm Apple-designed dynamic driver that is said to provide \"rich, deep bass, accurate mid-ranges, and crisp, clean high-frequency extension.\" Each ear cup is equipped with Apple's H1 chip for \"computational audio\" to deliver the \"highest quality listening experience possible,\" according to Apple.\nSimilar to the Apple Watch, AirPods Max feature a Digital Crown on one ear cup for precise volume control and the ability to play or pause audio, skip tracks, answer or end phone calls, and activate Siri voice control. There's also a noise control button for switching between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode, which lets some outside sound in so you can interact naturally with your surroundings.\nAirPods Max feature up to 20 hours of battery life with Active Noise Cancellation and spatial audio enabled \u2014 fine print reveals that Apple had volume set to 50% during its testing. Apple says a five-minute charge delivers 1.5 hours of listening time.\nAs with other AirPods models, AirPods Max have one-tap setup and automatic pairing with all the devices signed in to a user's iCloud account, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. AirPods Max have built-in optical and position sensors that automatically detect when the headphones are on someone's head. Once in place, AirPods Max play audio and can pause once removed, or when the user lifts one ear cup.\nApple's announcement provides more details on audio features:\n- Adaptive EQ: AirPods Max use Adaptive EQ to adjust the sound to the fit and seal of the ear cushions by measuring the sound signal delivered to a user and adjusting the low and mid-frequencies in real time \u2014 bringing rich audio that captures every detail. - Active Noise Cancellation: AirPods Max deliver immersive sound through Active Noise Cancellation so users can focus on what they are listening to. Each ear cup features three outward-facing microphones to detect environmental noise, while one microphone inside the ear cup monitors the sound reaching the listener's ear. Using computational audio, noise cancellation continuously adapts to the headphone fit and movement in real time. - Transparency Mode: With AirPods Max, users can switch to Transparency mode to simultaneously listen to music while hearing the environment around them \u2014 ensuring everything, including a user's own voice, sounds natural while audio plays perfectly. Switching between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode can be done with a single press using the noise control button. - Spatial Audio: AirPods Max use spatial audio with dynamic head tracking to place sounds virtually anywhere in a space \u2014 delivering an immersive, theaterlike experience for content recorded in 5.1, 7.1, and Dolby Atmos. Using the gyroscope and accelerometer in AirPods Max and iPhone or iPad, spatial audio tracks the motion of a user's head as well as the device, compares the motion data, then remaps the sound field so it stays anchored to the device, even as the user's head moves.\nFor phone calls and Siri commands, beam-forming microphones help to block out ambient noise and focus on the user's voice.\nAirPods Max come with a carrying case called the \"Smart Case\" and a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box. Apple says the Smart Case puts the AirPods Max in an ultra-low power state that helps to preserve battery charge when not in use.\nAirPods Max are launching in the United States and more than 25 other countries and regions, with shipments set to begin arriving to customers on Tuesday, December 15. AirPods Max can be ordered on Apple.com starting today.\nMore Coverage",

        "title": "Samsung plans to ditch power adapters just 3 months after mocking Apple over the same",
        "body": "Right after the Apple event in October, Samsung mocked the company for not including the power adapter in the iPhone 12 box and also removing it from the older models. Now, as some rumors have predicted, the Galaxy S21\u2019s documentation suggests that it will also not come with a charger included in the box.\nAs reported by Brazilian website Tecnoblog, the new Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+, and Galaxy S21 Ultra have just been approved by ANATEL in Brazil, which is the equivalent agency to the FCC in the United States. The new devices have the codenames SM-G991B/DS, SM-G996B/DS, and SM-G998B/DS, respectively.\nWhile the documentation filed at ANATEL doesn\u2019t reveal much detail about upcoming Galaxy smartphones, it does reveal a noteworthy change in the lineup of Samsung\u2019s phones for the next year. ANATEL says that all three new Galaxy S21 models will not have a charger included in the box. Headphones will not be included either.\nThis doesn\u2019t come as a surprise since rumors already predicted that Samsung would ditch included chargers in its future smartphones, but it\u2019s ironic that the company continues to mock Apple but then it does the same things later. A few years ago, the South Korean company made jokes about Apple removing the headphone jack from the iPhone in 2017, then the Galaxy Note 10 was introduced in 2019 without the headphone jack \u2014 just like the iPhone.\nWhat is also interesting to mention is that Brazil\u2019s National Consumer Secretary is considering forcing Apple to sell iPhones with included charger in the country. If this happens, Samsung may also be forced to keep the charger in the box of its smartphones in Brazil \u2014 and perhaps other countries will do the same.",

        "title": "Child spends $16K on iPad game in-app purchases",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nOver the summer of 2020, a six-year-old spent over $16,000 in the App Store, on in-app purchases for the iPad version of Sega's \"Sonic Forces.\"\nJessica Johnson of Wilton, CT. discovered a series of withdrawals made from her credit card over a series of months, posted by Apple's in-app purchasing system. The purchases were made by her youngest son, George, who was repeatedly acquiring in-game currency for the game Sonic Forces.\nThe spending spree, which totaled $16,293.10, took place over a series of months starting in July, when George started buying add-ons in the game, starting from a $1.99 pack to $99.99 bundles, reports the New York Post. On July 9, 25 charges were made to her account, valued cumulatively at over $2,500, over eight times the price of the cheapest iPad currently available.\nThe transactions were initially thought to be fraud or a mistake by Johnson, who found it \"almost impossible\" to figure out that they originated from in-app purchases. After filing a fraud claim with Chase, she was then informed the charges were genuine, and was told to contact Apple.\nOnce she contacted Apple and was talked through a \"buried running list of all the charges\" and seeing the Sonic icon, she realized it was her son's fault. \"It's like my 6-year-old was doing lines of cocaine - and doing bigger and bigger hits,\" Johnson said.\nApple refused to refund her money, as she didn't inform the company within 60 days of the charges. Johnson says that she didn't tell Apple on time, because Chase told her the transactions were likely to be fraud.\nApple Support was also apparently cold to when Johnson admitted she wouldn't have been able to make a mortgage payment. The support person reportedly told her that \"there's a setting, you should have known.\"\nIt isn't clear why the parents weren't alerted sooner to the purchases by the email notifications sent to the iCloud account address on file when the account was billed.\nOn initial setup, the Johnson family had to bypass defaults set in place for account and in-app purchase verification for this to happen, without the child knowing the family iCloud account credentials. Johnson admits she did not take precautions to lock down the account, but claims she didn't know about them.\n\"Obviously, if I had known there was a setting for that, I wouldn't have allowed my 6-year-old to run up nearly $20,000 in charges for virtual gold rings,\" Jessica added.\nThe mother then went on to accuse the games of being \"completely predatory\" in encouraging spending by younger users. \"What grown-up would spend $100 on a chest of virtual gold coins?\"\nApple has offered a number of parental control options over the years to manage a child's access on an iPhone or iPad, including limiting purchases and access to apps themselves. Similar controls are also available in macOS.\nApple has also attempted to educate parents about ways to manage their children's usage habits and the existence of limiting features via a dedicated microsite, in part driven by the various high-spend incidents that occasionally become news.",

On the other hand, Apple and Samsung are the closest rivals. And every move each of them makes, will be criticized by another one undoubtedly. In this regard, when the iPhone 12 was out and we found no charger and headphones inside the box, Samsung began joking on this. However, it seems the Galaxy S21 seems to be preparing to follow in the footsteps of the iPhone 12. Moreover, Samsung officials seem to have deleted previous posts mocking Apple.\nEarlier this year, Samsung was still mocking Apple for launching the iPhone 12 without a charger, and announced that \u2018Our Galaxy phone can provide you with everything you need, from the basic charger to the best camera, battery, performance, and memory.\u2019 From this point of you, we have been thinking that Samsung will focus on what Apple has \u2018missed\u2019 and will bring a 120Hz screen as well as the charger. We were na\u00efve.\nGizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram\nNow, as we can see, Samsung has deleted their Facebook posts mocking Apple. This has become a strong evidence of its decision to imitate Apple. It is worth noting that Brazil and the European market are facing this situation. It is unclear whether other markets will follow up on this decision.\nSamsung Galaxy S21 Features\nIn other aspects, according to previously exposed news, the new Samsung Galaxy S21 series will still have the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+ and Galaxy S21 Ultra three models. They all will adopt a center-opening full-screen design. The S21 and S21+ will sport a flat/straight screen design, while the S21 Ultra will use a curved screen. In addition to the new Snapdragon 888 chip, selected markets will get a version equipped with its own brand new Samsung Exynos 2100 mobile platform.\nThe new Samsung Galaxy S21 series flagship will be unveiled on January 14 next year. Of course, the selling point is the chip Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and Samsung Exynos 2100 based on 5nm process. But it will come with an improved camera, faster charging, and other highlights as well.",

According to figures cited by Facebook, the new measures will be \"devastating to small businesses\".\nNot everyone is turned off by the move, Firefox developer Mozilla recently came out in full support of measures, calling on its users to petition Apple to implement the changes as soon as possible, calling them \"a huge win for consumers.\"\nBrand new App Store nutrition labels for privacy recently revealed the staggering amount of data Facebook holds on its users, a list of data points on the App Store runs to more than 650 words.

Regardless, some companies like Facebook are still unhappy about the upcoming change, and a group of advertising companies and publishers in France have gone as far as filing an antitrust complaint over the matter.\nThis pressure from some advertisers has led Firefox maker Mozilla to launch a new page in which it urges people to show their support for Apple's decision, so that it does not further delay. \"We need a massive outpouring of support for Apple's decision to help strengthen its resolve to protect consumer privacy,\" says Mozilla. \"Sign this thank you to let Apple know consumers are eagerly anticipating anti-tracking protection on iPhone.\"\nLast year, Mozilla urged Apple to reset the unique IDs used to serve interest-based ads in the App Store and Apple News apps on a monthly basis. Mozilla now says that Apple \"went even further than what Mozilla supporters had asked for,\" calling the planned anti-tracking changes a \"huge win for consumers.\"",

        "title": "Apple targets car production by 2024 and eyes 'next level' battery technology - sources",
        "body": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc is moving forward with self-driving car technology and is targeting 2024 to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nThe iPhone maker\u2019s automotive efforts, known as Project Titan, have proceeded unevenly since 2014 when it first started to design its own vehicle from scratch. At one point, Apple drew back the effort to focus on software and reassessed its goals. Doug Field, an Apple veteran who had worked at Tesla Inc, returned to oversee the project in 2018 and laid off 190 people from the team in 2019.\nSince then, Apple has progressed enough that it now aims to build a vehicle for consumers, two people familiar with the effort said, asking not to be named because Apple\u2019s plans are not public. Apple\u2019s goal of building a personal vehicle for the mass market contrasts with rivals such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo, which has built robo-taxis to carry passengers for a driverless ride-hailing service.\nCentral to Apple\u2019s strategy is a new battery design that could \u201cradically\u201d reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle\u2019s range, according to a third person who has seen Apple\u2019s battery design.\nApple declined to comment on its plans or future products.\nMaking a vehicle represents a supply chain challenge even for Apple, a company with deep pockets that makes hundreds of millions of electronics products each year with parts from around the world, but has never made a car. It took Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla 17 years before it finally turned a sustained profit making cars.\n\u201cIf there is one company on the planet that has the resources to do that, it\u2019s probably Apple. But at the same time, it\u2019s not a cellphone,\u201d said a person who worked on Project Titan.\nIt remains unclear who would assemble an Apple-branded car, but sources have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner to build vehicles. And there is still a chance Apple will decide to reduce the scope of its efforts to an autonomous driving system that would be integrated with a car made by a traditional automaker, rather than the iPhone maker selling an Apple-branded car, one of the people added.\nTwo people with knowledge of Apple\u2019s plans warned pandemic-related delays could push the start of production into 2025 or beyond.\nFILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo/File Photo\nShares of Tesla ended 6.5% lower on Monday after their debut in the S&P 500 on Monday. Apple shares ended 1.24% higher after the news.\nApple has decided to tap outside partners for elements of the system, including lidar sensors, which help self-driving cars get a three-dimensional view of the road, two people familiar with the company\u2019s plans said.\nApple\u2019s car might feature multiple lidar sensors for scanning different distances, another person said. Some sensors could be derived from Apple\u2019s internally developed lidar units, that person said. Apple\u2019s iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro models released this year both feature lidar sensors.\nReuters had previously reported that Apple had held talks with potential lidar suppliers, but it was also examining building its own sensor.\nAs for the car\u2019s battery, Apple plans to use a unique \u201cmonocell\u201d design that bulks up the individual cells in the battery and frees up space inside the battery pack by eliminating pouches and modules that hold battery materials, one of the people said.\nApple\u2019s design means that more active material can be packed inside the battery, giving the car a potentially longer range. Apple is also examining a chemistry for the battery called LFP, or lithium iron phosphate, the person said, which is inherently less likely to overheat and is thus safer than other types of lithium-ion batteries.\n\u201dIt\u2019s next level,\u201d the person said of Apple\u2019s battery technology. \u201cLike the first time you saw the iPhone.\u201d\nApple had previously engaged Magna International Inc in talks about manufacturing a car, but the talks petered out as Apple\u2019s plans became unclear, a person familiar with those previous efforts said. Magna did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTo turn a profit, automotive contract manufacturers often ask for volumes that could pose a challenge even to Apple, which would be a newcomer to the automotive market.\n\u201cIn order to have a viable assembly plant, you need 100,000 vehicles annually, with more volume to come,\u201d the person said.\nSome Apple investors reacted to the Reuters report on the company\u2019s plans with caution. Trip Miller, managing partner at Apple investor Gullane Capital Partners, said it could be tough for Apple to produce large volumes of cars out of the gate.\n\u201cIt would seem to me that if Apple develops some advanced operating system or battery technology, it would be best utilized in a partnership with an existing manufacturer under license,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAs we see with Tesla and the legacy auto companies, having a very complex manufacturing network around the globe doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d\nHal Eddins, chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said Apple has a history of higher margins than most automakers.\n\u201cMy initial reaction as a shareholder is, huh?\u201d Eddins said. \u201cStill don\u2019t really see the appeal of the car business, but Apple may be eyeing another angle than what I\u2019m seeing.\u201d",

        "body": "If you\u2019ve ever wished Apple made matte black MacBooks, a new patent shows that the company is at least considering the idea.\nApple begins by explaining the likely reason it hasn\u2019t yet done it: it\u2019s really hard to get a true black, rather than a dark grey \u2026\nHere\u2019s what the company says in the background to the patent:\nEnclosures for portable electronic devices can include an anodized layer that can be dyed in different colors in order to enhance their cosmetic appeal to consumers. However, certain colors are far more difficult to achieve than others. In particular, attempts by consumer electronic device manufacturers to achieve a true black color have fallen short. Indeed, the best attempts have attained only a dark grey color. One challenge to achieving a true black color is that anodized metal can have a relatively high floss finish, which is capable of specularly reflecting large amounts of visible light [\u2026] Merely depositing dye particles within pores of an anodized layer is insufficient to impart a true black color. Indeed, the anodized layer plateaus at an L* value in the low 20s. Part of the challenge to achieving a true black color is that the surface of these enclosures generally has a high gloss finish, which contributes to specular reflection of a large amount of visible light.\nThere are two secrets to pulling it off, says the patent.\nThe etched anodized surface of the enclosures having light-trapping features (also referred to as light-absorbing features) is capable of absorbing generally almost all visible light incident thereupon. Additionally, whatever visible light not absorbed by the light-trapping features is diffusely reflected by the light-trapping features. As a result, the etched anodized part is characterized as having a matte, low gloss finish. The matte, low gloss finish combined with black color particles infused within pores are capable of hiding surface geometries of the external surface.\nAs with all Apple patents, there\u2019s no telling whether or not the idea will ever make it to market, but there seems little doubt that matte black MacBooks would prove popular.\nIn the meantime, ColorWare does offer a matte black skin for the MacBook, but this suffers from the problem Apple describes: it looks more like grey than a true deep black.\nVia Patently Apple",

Get your party on.\u201d Organizers would have to approve everyone who wanted to attend, and those who got approved would receive the address two hours before the event. Most of these gatherings would have been illegal under current US pandemic restrictions \u2014 which may explain why the app required you to submit a profile for approval before you were allowed on.\nScreenshots from the iOS App Store page.\nCalling a phone number on Vybe Together\u2019s site connected The Verge with someone who identified themselves as Albin, one of the app\u2019s co-founders. They said that the app had a few thousand users, and that a few thousand additional applicants had requested access to it since the company started putting videos on TikTok. Applying involved submitting your Instagram handle and uploading pictures of you partying to the service, presumably to make sure that you weren\u2019t someone who was going to spill the beans about the events.\nVybe Together largely had a low profile before today, although it was mentioned in at least one EventBrite invitation to a New York party in September. It received wider exposure after The New York Times reporter Taylor Lorenz critically tweeted screenshots of the website and described it as an app for \u201cfinding and promoting COVID-unsafe large, indoor house parties.\u201d\nVybe Together\u2019s now-removed FAQ page acknowledged the danger of the pandemic, but it said the app was designed to promote \u201csmall gatherings\u201d rather than \u201cbig parties.\u201d (Smaller gatherings of people from different households can still spread the coronavirus, creating chains of infection that extend far beyond the original event, putting people who didn\u2019t attend the party at risk.)\nIn a statement to The Verge, a spokesperson denied that the app was intended to promote unsafe behavior. \u201cVybe Together was [a minimum viable product] designed to help other people organize small get-togethers in parks or apartments during COVID,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe never hosted any large parties, and we made one over-the-top marketing video that left a wrong impression about our intentions, which has since been taken down. We do not condone large unsafe parties during a pandemic.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unknown whether the app substantially contributed to people holding unsafe events, although it promoted \u201cgatherings every weekend\u201d \u2014 including an upcoming New Year\u2019s Eve party \u2014 in a TikTok video. The Vybe Together app had only 25 ratings before being removed, and its Instagram page has under 1,000 followers. In a statement to The Verge, TikTok said the account on that platform had only 139 followers when it was removed. The app appears to have launched previously under the name Trendies, a name mentioned on its now largely empty Instagram page.\nVybe Together\u2019s website also advertised a \u201cVybe House\u201d for the 2021 Zamna Festival music event in Tulum, Mexico. The house\u2019s pictures correspond to an Airbnb listing for a rental called the Casa Remy Villa. However, the listing\u2019s manager couldn\u2019t confirm the existence of a \u201cVybe House\u201d event to The Verge.\n\u201cWe have rented the villa to some influencers,\u201d said the owner, who said they had \u201cno idea\u201d if any renters were linked to the app. \u201cBut they know parties aren\u2019t allowed of any kind as they are forbidden by authorities during [the] pandemic, with the risk of shutting down the property and a huge fine.\u201d The Airbnb host also notes that the Zamna Festival was recently postponed to April \u2014 not the January dates listed on its website.\nVybe Together\u2019s Instagram account now contains a single text post. \u201cBlown out of proportion by media,\u201d it reads. \u201cWe DO NOT CONDONE LARGE GATHERINGS.\u201d\nUpdate December 29th, 8:06PM ET: The app\u2019s creators have now clarified that Apple was the one to pull the app from the App Store.",

Apple is featuring the news on its homepage in the US and other countries after first showing up on Apple\u2019s Japanese site.\nThis past April, Apple and (RED) starting giving a portion of eligible proceeds to the Global Fund for COVID-19 relief but now it\u2019s being bumped to 100% through June 30, 2021.\nHere\u2019s the announcement that notes providing pandemic relief will help keep \u201clifesaving HIV/AIDS programs\u201d going in Africa.\nFor 14 years, our partnership with (RED) has led to almost $250 million in donations to fund HIV/AIDS treatment programs.

        "title": "Facebook and Apple are in a fight. Your browsing history is in the middle.",
        "body": "Apple and Facebook are going to need each other in the long run, because billions of people want their social media apps to work well on their phones and tablets. But first, the two California tech giants need to settle a brawl that\u2019s playing out in newspaper ads, industry meetings and potentially federal court.\nFacebook on Thursday ran its second full-page newspaper advertisement in as many days, attacking Apple's plans to tell iPhone and iPad users when apps are tracking them online.\n\u201cApple plans to roll out a forced software update that will change the internet as we know it \u2014 for the worse,\u201d Facebook said in the ad.\nIt\u2019s a high-stakes and unusually personal fight between two companies that have wide-reaching influence. At the center of the battle is how the advertising-dependent part of the internet is going to work in the years ahead.\nIn the next few weeks, Apple is planning to roll out a new feature on its devices that will alert people when an app such as Facebook is trying to \u201ctrack your activity across other companies\u2019 apps and websites.\u201d People will have options such as \u201cAsk App not to Track\u201d or \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\u201cUsers should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites \u2014 and they should have the choice to allow that or not,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cApp Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 does not require Facebook to change its approach to tracking users and creating targeted advertising, it simply requires they give users a choice.\u201d\nFor Facebook, the possibility that many people will disallow tracking threatens one of the data streams that make its advertising business so lucrative. Facebook uses data such as browsing history to show people ads they\u2019re more likely to want to see, and to prove to marketers that its ads are working.\n\u201cApple\u2019s move isn\u2019t about privacy, it\u2019s about profit,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. It argues that Apple stands to gain if more of the internet becomes subscription-based, because Apple collects commissions from its app store.\nThe two companies, headquartered a 15-minute drive apart, have been circling each other warily for years. Apple CEO Tim Cook has dinged Facebook for \u201ccollecting gobs of personal data,\u201d while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has fired back by calling iPhones an expensive product for the world\u2019s elite, not the masses. Facebook encourages its employees to use rival Android devices.\nLast year, Apple caused temporary disarray at Facebook headquarters by shutting off Facebook employees\u2019 access to internal Facebook corporate apps that run on iPhones. Apple had determined that Facebook improperly paid teenagers and others for their smartphone data.\nThe companies have radically different business models. Facebook last year made $70 billion from advertising, almost its only revenue source. Advertising sales are a small part of Apple\u2019s $275 billion annual revenue, which comes mainly from device sales and app store commissions.\nApple has said the new tracking notifications will start to appear in early 2021. Privacy groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation support them.\nBut Facebook is making a last-ditch effort to persuade Apple to back off or compromise with industry standard-setters.With offline ads in newspapers such as The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, the social networking company is trying to rally to its side the millions of small businesses who buy ads on Facebook and Instagram.\nThe latest ad, on Thursday, argues that free online publishers won\u2019t be able to survive if Apple has its way, unless the publishers charge subscriptions \u2014 which Apple may get a cut of, thanks to the rules in its app store.\n\u201cTake your favorite cooking sites or sports blogs. Most are free because they show advertisements,\u201d Facebook said in its ad. \u201cApple\u2019s change will limit their ability to run personalized ads. To make ends meet, many will have to start charging you subscription fees or adding more in-app purchases, making the internet much more expensive and reducing high-quality free content.\u201d\nFacebook has raised the prospect of antitrust legal action. It said in a blog post that it was committed to providing information to a federal court in an ongoing lawsuit against Apple filed by Epic Games, which is seeking to reduce the fees it pays through the Apple app store.\n\u201cWe believe Apple is behaving anti-competitively by using their control of the App Store to benefit their bottom line at the expense of app developers and small businesses. We continue to explore ways to address this concern,\u201d Facebook said.\nFacebook is battling antitrust complaints from states and the Federal Trade Commission, and both Zuckerberg and Cook have been compared to \u201cemperors.\u201d\nApple, for now, is standing by its plans for tracking notifications and pointing to a long record of advocating for online privacy.\n\u201cWe believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users,\u201d Apple said.",

        "body": "An Amazon Web Services (AWS) virtualization engineer has shown what Windows 10 on Arm could be like if Microsoft licensed its Arm-based OS to the public rather than just to Windows 10 manufacturers.\nWith Apple's new M1 Arm-based system on chip, Mac users who need to use Windows 10 can't run Microsoft's Arm-based version of Windows using Apple's Bootcamp.\nThe key obstacle is that Microsoft doesn't license Windows 10 on Arm to any entities other than its own Surface group and Windows 10 on Arm OEMs like HP, Asus and Lenovo.\nSEE: Windows 10 Start menu hacks (TechRepublic Premium)\nTechnically, there's nothing stopping owners of the M1 MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13-inch or Mac mini from running Windows 10 on Arm, as Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi recently pointed out.\n\"We have the core technologies for them to do that, to run their Arm version of Windows, which in turn of course supports x86 user mode applications. But that's a decision Microsoft has to make, to bring to license that technology for users to run on these Macs. But the Macs are certainly very capable of it,\" said Federighi.\nBut Microsoft's reluctance to create a license for Windows 10 on Arm for end users hasn't stopped creative engineers from putting together a working example of what things could be like if it did.\nAWS principal engineer Alexander Graf did just that, using the open-source QEMU virtualization software for Windows on Arm. QEMU emulates access to hardware such as the CPU and GPU. Graf's work was spotted by The 8-bit, via 9to5Mac.\n\"Who said Windows wouldn't run well on #AppleSilicon? It's pretty snappy here,\" Graf wrote in a tweet.\nGraf previously worked on the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) for Linux distribution SUSE for over a decade. He also worked on the SUSE Arm team to bring \"openSUSE and SLES to all Arm platforms where it made sense\", according to Graf's Linkedin profile. And he worked on Mac OS X virtualization using KVM.\nNow he's a KVM developer at AWS, which today announced new Mac instances for AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) based on Nitro System, an AWS hypervisor for EC2 instances.\nAWS EC2 Mac instances with the Apple M1 chip \"are already in the works, and planned for 2021\". But the current AWS offering include instances of 8th generation, six-core Intel Core i7 processors running at 3.2GHz. The instances allow developers to run applications for the Apple's macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, and Safari.\nSEE: Digital transformation: The new rules for getting projects done\nA developer using the handle @imbushuo on Twitter has posted Geekbench versions 4 and 5 scores that compare Windows 10 on Arm on an M1 computer with the Microsoft-made Surface Pro X.\nWindows on an M1 got a single-core score of 1,288 and multi-core score of 5,685 whereas the Surface Pro X's scores were roughly 800 and 3,000 in those respective benchmarks. Per MSpoweruser, the Surface Pro X benchmark was made using the SQ2 Arm-based chip that was co-developed by Qualcomm and Microsoft for Microsoft's latest Surface Pro X computers.\nThe benchmarks don't bode well for Microsoft's Windows on Arm ambitions to create an ecosystem of Windows OEMs if Apple's new in-house M1 chips make Macs the highest-performing hardware for running Windows on Arm.",

        "title": "Apple's New Privacy-Focused Tracking Prompt Begins Appearing in iOS 14.4 Beta",
        "body": "As a privacy measure, Apple will be requiring developers of iPhone and iPad apps to request permission from users to track their activity across other apps and websites for personalized advertising purposes starting early next year.\nAhead of time, the prompt for users to allow or deny tracking has started to show up in the first beta of iOS 14.4, seeded last week. A screenshot shared in the MacRumors forums shows the NBA app requesting to track a user's activity, with the customizable fine print indicating that the data will be used to provide users \"a better and personalized ad experience.\"\nUpdate: We've learned that apps have been able to prompt users for tracking permission since iOS 14 was released in September, and some apps already introduced the prompt prior to the iOS 14.4 beta. Apple is still planning to require use of the prompt \"early next year.\"\nLast week, Facebook claimed that Apple's new requirement will hurt small businesses, adding that the move is \"more about profit than privacy.\" In a full-page newspaper ad, Facebook said that Apple's move will force small businesses to turn to subscriptions and other in-app payments for revenue, in turn benefitting Apple's bottom line.\n\"They're hurting small businesses and publishers who are already struggling in a pandemic,\" said Facebook, in a blog post. \"These changes will directly affect their ability to use their advertising budgets efficiently and effectively.\"\nIn response to Facebook, Apple expressed that users deserve control and transparency. \"We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users,\" said Apple, adding that \"users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites \u2014 and they should have the choice to allow that or not.\"\nEarlier this week, the non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called Facebook's campaign against Apple \"laughable\" and applauded Apple for its \"pro-privacy\" change.\n\"When a company does the right thing for its users, EFF will stand with it, just as we will come down hard on companies that do the wrong thing,\" the EFF said. \"Here, Apple is right and Facebook is wrong.\"",

        "title": "An iOS 14 bug doesn\u2019t show notifications when some new messages arrive",
        "body": "If you\u2019ve noticed that you\u2019re receiving SMS texts and iMessages from people but aren\u2019t getting any notifications about them, you\u2019re not alone. Far from it. I\u2019m one of many people experiencing an annoying bug where messages come through fine \u2014 but without any pop-up notification or even the usual red badge to indicate that there\u2019s a new message waiting to be read.\nLast month, MacRumors wrote about increasing reports of the problem on the new iPhone 12, 12 mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max phones. But it seems to also be affecting people with older iPhones as well, so this is looking more and more like an iOS 14 issue. What\u2019s more aggravating about the glitch is that it doesn't always happen. I\u2019ve noticed some messages pop up on my lock screen like normal, but others just quietly roll in with me being none the wiser.\nPeople in that very large MacRumors thread have tried to come up with workarounds like turning off Messages on a Mac, or deleting and re-adding contacts. Some are noticing they get notifications if they completely force close the Messages app every time after sending a text. And in other cases, the missing notifications are only happening for pinned conversations, and unpinning contacts seems to do the trick. There are sporadic reports of success with these short-term fixes, but they aren\u2019t working for everyone. There\u2019s also this 42-page thread on the company\u2019s support forums about the ongoing frustrations.\nThose dealing with the issue are understandably disappointed that Apple hasn\u2019t released a thorough fix yet. This is pretty fundamental stuff, and it\u2019s probably causing some awkward conversations between couples or friends when messages just sit there for hours without the recipient knowing they came. And if you\u2019re hoping that all will be well when iOS 14.3 releases next week, I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. Early reports indicate that the no-text-notifications bug remains present \u2014 at least in some cases \u2014 in the second release candidate build of iOS 14.3 that Apple pushed out to public beta testers yesterday.",

        "title": "Facebook Employees Criticize Campaign Against Apple in Leaked Comments",
        "body": "Amid a barrage of public attacks on Apple from Facebook over privacy measures, Facebook employees have expressed their displeasure with the direction of the campaign in comments obtained by BuzzFeed News.\nLast week, Facebook launched a campaign in print newspapers explaining that it was \"standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere,\" and created a website encouraging people to \"Speak Up for Small Businesses.\"\nFacebook argues that Apple's privacy changes in iOS 14, which give users the option to opt-out of ad tracking, will harm small businesses that see increased sales from personalized ads. However, some Facebook employees are reportedly complaining about what they perceived to be a self-serving campaign.\nBuzzFeed News obtained internal comments from one of Facebook's private message boards and audio of a presentation to Facebook workers, revealing that there is discontentment among employees about the angle used to attack Apple's privacy changes. One Facebook engineer, in response to an internal post about the campaign from Facebook's advertising chief Dan Levy, said:\nIt feels like we are trying to justify doing a bad thing by hiding behind people with a sympathetic message.\nAhead of an internal meeting to explain the rationale of the campaign against Apple, Facebook employees asked and voted up several questions that focused on the consequences of the campaign on Facebook's public image. The most popular questions asked reportedly all expressed skepticism or concern:\nAren't we worried that our stance protecting [small- and medium-sized businesses] will backfire as people see it as \"Facebook protecting their own business\" instead? People want \"privacy,\" Facebook objecting here will be viewed with cynicism. Did we know this would be bad PR, and decide to publish anyway? How do we pick a message that looks less self-serving?\nIn response, Facebook vice president of product marketing Graham Mudd said that the company has been \"really clear\" that Apple's changes do \"have a financial impact on us,\" in addition to small businesses:\nWe're not trying to sweep that under the rug. We are, you know, a profitable, big company and we're going to get through this and adapt our products and so forth. But the real folks that are going to get hit by this are small businesses, and that's why we made them the focus of the message.\nFollowing the presentation, many Facebook employees were apparently unconvinced. Some did not understand how Apple's changes would negatively affect small businesses, while one highlighted that Apple's privacy changes also prevent \"malicious actors\" from tracking people:\nWe're not going to\u2026 be the only ones that should be allowed to track people without their consent \u2014 any company can do that, even smaller startups and malicious actors.\nThe same employee launched a scathing attack on Levy's post, accompanied by a popular meme with the text \"Are we the baddies?\"\nThe only thing I'm hearing, again and again, is \"this is bad for the businesses,\" and I'd really like someone at the top to explicitly say, \"People are better off if they don't know what we're doing, if we don't have to explain ourselves to them, if they don't get a choice to opt-in or opt-out of our practices, if we obscure it as much as possible behind interesting features and then get them to accept surreptitious tracking on the back end as long as we downplay it.\"\nOther critics suggested that Facebook incentivizes opting-in to ad tracking in a positive campaign rather than attacking the notion of a choice to opt-in or out. Levy responded to criticisms explaining that the campaign was simply \"not about our business model.\"\nThat's Apple's marketing working and convincing you to scapegoat us so they can decide how the internet should work \u2014 even beyond their devices. I'm an optimist who works in technology because I think tech can be a lever for democratizing access and giving opportunity. Including for businesses. And if you think this is going to stop with personalized ads... well, then I disagree.\nOther comments from employees highlighted that the spirited defense of small businesses was hypocritical because Facebook has repeatedly disabled the ad accounts of small business advertisers by mistake and increasingly uses automated customer support, leading to a plethora of public complaints from small businesses:\n[They] highlight that we're probably not doing everything we can to \"stand up for small [businesses]\" when we don't provide human customer service support to small advertisers.\nFacebook spokesperson Ashley Zandy responded to BuzzFeed News, insisting that the stories of small businesses are Facebook's priority:\nSince launching this effort we have heard from small businesses literally around the world who are worried about how these changes could hurt their businesses. Because this is such a critical time for [small- and medium-sized businesses], we will continue to share those stories with the public and our employees.\nFollowing the launch of the campaign, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-profit organization that defends civil liberties in the digital world, called Facebook's criticisms of tracking-related privacy measures \"laughable.\"",
