        "title": "Apple removes most of Alex Jones\u2019s podcasts from the Podcasts app",
        "body": "Some of the world's largest social media and tech companies kicked Alex Jones and his conspiracy-theory driven show, InfoWars, off their platforms on Monday after months of hand-wringing about how to handle a personality who claimed he was delivering news but didn't deal in facts.\nApple moved first, striking the entire library for five of Infowars' six podcasts from its iTunes and Podcasts apps. Among the podcasts, which were removed from Apple's iTunes directory, are the show War Room and the popular Alex Jones Show podcast, which is hosted daily by the prominent conspiracy theorist.\nAfter that, platforms that have come under far more scrutiny for hosting Jones and his content \u2014 Facebook and YouTube \u2014 quickly followed suit after long and tortured deliberations. Spotify also did the same.\nIn all, the actions will currently seriously limit Jones's ability to reach his massive audience. Twitter and Periscope remain one of the sole major platforms to still host Jones.\nYouTube's enforcement action will have the greatest impact on Jones. His channel had nearly 2.5 million subscribers and more than 1 billion views over its lifetime. It killed most if not all of the videos hosted on Jones's website.\nYouTube told BuzzFeed News that \"when users violate\" the platform's terms and policies \"repeatedly, like our policies against hate speech and harassment of our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures, we terminate their accounts.\"\nApple's decision to remove all episodes of Jones' popular show \u2014 rather than just specific offending episodes \u2014 was, at the beginning of the day, one of the largest enforcement actions intended to curb conspiratorial news content by a technology company to date.\nApple did not host Jones' shows, but it offered an index that allowed anyone with an iPhone to find and subscribe to them. As of 2018, Apple's Podcasts platform amassed 50 billion all-time downloads and streams.\n\"Apple does not tolerate hate speech, and we have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users,\" Apple said in a statement Sunday evening to BuzzFeed News. \"Podcasts that violate these guidelines are removed from our directory making them no longer searchable or available for download or streaming. We believe in representing a wide range of views, so long as people are respectful to those with differing opinions.\u201d\nThe InfoWars app is still available to download from Apple's store.\nFacebook confirmed on Monday morning that it had removed four pages promoting Jones and his shows: the Alex Jones Channel Page, the Alex Jones Page, the Infowars Nightly News Page, and the Infowars Page.\nIn a lengthy press release, a Facebook spokesperson said the pages were taken down \"for glorifying violence, which violates our graphic violence policy, and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants, which violates our hate speech policies.\"\nFacebook last week removed four of Jones' videos for violating hate speech and bullying rules and suspended Jones himself from being a page admin for 30 days. This further action was taken after more videos were reported by users.\nA Spotify spokesperson confirmed on Monday morning that the company has removed all episodes of The Alex Jones Show, after it removed some selected episodes last week. Spotify's hate content policy prohibits anything that \"expressly and principally promotes, advocates, or incites hatred or violence against a group or individual based on characteristics.\" The policy warns that repeat offenders will be removed from the platform.\nYouTube acted on Monday afternoon. Jones had been warned by the company that his live-streaming privileges were suspended for 90 days, however Jones attempted to livestream on other channels in clear violation of YouTube's rules.\nThe sweeping move is just the latest in a line of technology companies taking action against Jones and Infowars for violating rules against hateful content. Last month YouTube pulled down four videos posted by Jones and the podcast app Stitcher removed Jones' audio show, citing hateful content policies.\nAs the internet's largest podcast platform, Apple faced pressure all week from media and activists to remove Jones and Infowars from its services. Sleeping Giants, the online activist group that has lobbied for tech platforms to cut all ties with Jones, roundly condemned Apple last week for being slow to join Spotify and Stitcher, suggesting Jones' content routinely breaks the company's terms of service.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nGoogle updated help center documentation Thursday to clarify its location data collection policies, changes made in light of recent revelations that the firm's apps and website continue to harvest user information even when a global \"Location History\" setting is disabled.\nEarlier this week, the Associated Press, with help from Princeton researchers, broke news that Google logs users' location data even when features that are meant to stop the tracking are enabled. Whether on iOS or Android, many Google apps \u2014 including Google Maps \u2014 store a user's location whenever the app is opened.\nIn response to the report, Google updated its support documents to better explain the feature, called \"Location History,\" though it continues to collect the data.\nApps like Google Maps require location access in order to provide real-time directions, meaning users must allow iOS to share that data with the app. In an effort to help users who would want to use the app, but don't want their data stored, Google offers a feature called Location History which can pause logging of that data.\nPreviously, Google's support page said Location History can be turned off by the user at any given time, assumedly preventing visited places from being stored on Google's servers.\n\"With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored,\" the document read. The AP investigation showed this was not the case.\nGoogle's updated language now says, \"This setting does not affect other location services on your device,\" and adds, \"Some location data may be saved as part of your activity on other services, like Search and Maps.\"\n\"We have been updating the explanatory language about Location History to make it more consistent and clear across our platforms and help centers.\" Google said in a statement to the AP.\nUsers who wish to stop tracking altogether must disable \"Web and App Activity\" in addition to Location History. Leaving Web and App Activity enabled while turning Location History off only prevents additions to the Google Maps timeline, and does not stop data collection.",

        "body": "Earlier today, Samsung officially unveiled its brand new (and oft-leaked) Galaxy Note 9 with a 6.4-inch display. While Samsung touts the device\u2019s Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset and 6GB or 8GB of RAM under-the-hood, but earlier benchmarks show the device is still outperformed by the iPhone X\u2026\nAs highlighted by Tom\u2019s Guide, who tested the Galaxy Note 9 with 6GB of RAM, the iPhone X was able to come out on top in the majority of benchmark tests.\nIn Geekbench 4 testing, the iPhone X was able to outperform all other devices with a score of 10,357. That compares to the Galaxy Note 9 at 8,876 and the OnePlus 6 at 9,088.\nGeekbench 4 measures overall performance, and the Note 9 delivers solid performance in the benchmark\u2019s multi-core test. The Note 9 notched 8,876, which is considerably better than last year\u2019s Note 8. It also smokes the Pixel 2 XL, but that phone was running an older Snapdragon 835 chip, just like the Note 8.\nMeanwhile, in the Slingshot Extreme benchmark test, which is \u201cone of the most demanding graphics test in 3DMark\u2019s mobile arsenal,\u201d the Galaxy Note 9 was again outperformed. This time, the OnePlus 6 came in at the top with a score fo 5,124, while the iPhone X came in second at 4,994. Those numbers compare to the Note 9 and 4,639.\nSlingshot Extreme is the most demanding graphics test in 3DMark\u2019s mobile arsenal, and the Note 9 fared pretty well, but it\u2019s outperformed by both the iPhone X and OnePlus 6. The Galaxy Note 9 scored 4,639, which is slightly better than the Galaxy S9+ (4,634) and ahead of the LG G7 (4,201). However, the OnePlus 6 with 8GB of RAM smoked the Note 9 with a score of 5,124 and the iPhone X (4,994) also fared better.\nOne area where the Galaxy Note 9 did fare well, however, is in display testing. The device\u2019s AMOLED panel registered an impressive 224 percent of the sRGB color gamut, which is far better than the iPhone X\u2019s 128.6 percent. Meanwhile, the Note 9 also emitted 604 nits of brightness, which is brighter than the 574 nits on the iPhone X.\nBenchmarks aren\u2019t the end-all, be-all of smartphone performances, but these results are seemingly the latest evidence that the integration between hardware and software on the iPhone is unbeatable.\nRead more about the Galaxy Note 9 in 9to5Google\u2019s full hands-on.\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

Costco is also outfitting its gas stations with contactless readers, but only a few have gone live.\nCostco had previously been trialing Apple Pay at a warehouse in Issaquah, Washington, near its corporate headquarters, and a handful of other locations, but only now has acceptance rolled out to all of its stores.\nThe tap-to-pay functionality of Costco Anywhere credit cards is also working now. Costco launched this Visa-branded card a few years ago, in partnership with Citi, enabling Costco members to earn 2% cash back on purchases from Costco and Costco.com. It also doubles as a Costco membership card for entry.\nAs one of the biggest retailers in the United States, Apple Pay acceptance at Costco was long awaited.

        "title": "In less than a year, the $1,000 phone has become entirely normal",
        "body": "When you\u2019re paying close attention to the maelstrom of tech industry activity, the pace of change can seem logical, methodical, occasionally even a little slow. But look away for even the briefest period of time, and you\u2019ll be shocked by how quickly and radically things have changed when you check back in. The $1,000 price threshold for smartphones is a good example.\nThree or four years ago, anyone proposing a four-figure price for a phone would have been laughed out of their boardroom meeting. Two years ago, if I\u2019d told you Apple would be successfully selling a phone with a notch in its screen but no headphone jack, at a price of $999, you\u2019d have shaken your head and accused me of wilder wishful thinking than Gene Munster\u2019s Apple TV pipe dream. And even at this time last year, I was busy writing a disbelieving meditation on the topic of Samsung\u2019s upcoming Galaxy Note 8 and how it crossed past the $1,000 mark.\nAnd yet, for all our preconceptions about what reasonable smartphone pricing is and should be, every phone that\u2019s dared to nudge up to the $999 level and above has proven a success. Apple\u2019s iPhone X is selling faster and better than expected, leading one analyst to declare that it has brought 2019 demand forward. Though mostly unavailable in the US, Huawei\u2019s P20 Pro approaches iPhone X pricing, and it\u2019s proven a popular choice in Europe, comfortably eclipsing the sales of its cheaper predecessor. Samsung\u2019s Note 8, which got us all started on this upward trip in pricing, was also a solid hit for its maker, and the recently announced Note 9 is shaping up the same way.\niPhone X. Photo by James Bareham / The Verge\nWhat\u2019s striking to me is how quickly the way we talk about these products has changed. In August 2017, we talked of $1,000 iPhones with the same air of incredulity with which we \u2014 I, in particular \u2014 treated the alien-looking AirPods when they were first revealed. In August 2018, we speak of pricey phones in the same way we discuss AirPods today: different, not for everyone, but worth it for those who decide to take the plunge. I don\u2019t want to belabor this AirPods analogy too much, as the hike in smartphone pricing isn\u2019t tied to a radically improved convenience as in the case of Apple\u2019s truly wireless earbuds. With smartphones, companies pretty much just took a chance that we, the consumers, found more value in our phones than the price we were paying every couple of years. And they were right.\nMy interpretation of the past year, which has seen even the traditionally price-conscious China-centric manufacturers like Oppo bust out $999 models, is that it shows flagship smartphones were fundamentally mispriced. They were too cheap. The ease with which we\u2019ve adapted to the scaling up of the cost of a flagship device makes that clear. Figuring out why that is the case requires more nebulous explanations and a measure of speculation to come in.\nsince humans are irrational, today\u2019s pricing is going to stick\nEveryone\u2019s conscious of the status symbol quality of the iPhone, but a similar intangible value might be attached to a $1,000 Android phone. After all, it must be worth more if it\u2019s priced higher, right? We can pretend we\u2019re rational about these purchase decisions, but our minds tend to anchor on the initial price we\u2019re presented with, and then extrapolate perceived value from that number. There\u2019s tons of research to show how imperfect the correlation between the real and perceived value of a product is. So maybe smartphones last year were more rationally priced than this year, but since humans are irrational, today\u2019s pricing is going to stick, because it better matches the high-end market as it really is.\nOppo Find X. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nAlong with the very highest prices, we\u2019ve also witnessed the cost of midtier devices like those from OnePlus climbing over the past year and a half. I\u2019m not sure where super flagship pricing will go over the next few years, but I doubt midrange phones will get much more expensive. The competition among mass-market suppliers is still absolutely fierce, and price remains a decisive factor for many people shopping for their first or only phone. One potential outcome might be a widening of the gap between cheaper and more expensive phones, which would only reflect the broader economic divergence and inequality in our modern world.",

        "body": "Apple\u2019s next operating system is still in beta, but it already boasts much better performance than iOS 11. Speed improvements are high on Apple\u2019s list of promises for iOS 12, and there\u2019s little room for doubt that Cupertino will deliver.\nSpeed tests performed on older models, including an iPhone 5s, show iOS 12 makes the devices significantly faster.\nPeople are often too nervous to install new OS versions on aging iPhones. Apple releases upgrades for iPhones that are several years old, but there\u2019s a fear that they\u2019ll be more than the hardware can handle.\nTo test these iOS 12 performance concerns, iApple Bytes shot a video with one iPhone 5s running the just-released iOS 12 beta 8 next to a second unit running iOS 11.4.1. (For reference, the iPhone 5s debuted in 2013.)\nDifferences are obvious from the beginning. iOS 12 boots almost 20 seconds faster. In speed comparisons of Apple\u2019s \u201cstock\u201d applications, the newer operating system is almost always at least slightly quicker.\nOne notable exception: Opening the keyboard in iOS 12 proves dramatically faster than in its predecessor.\niOS 12 performance on newer iPhones\nThe iOS 12 performance difference isn\u2019t as significant when the same test is run on an iPhone 7. Still, iOS 12 is frequently at least slightly swifter on most actions than iOS 11.4.1.\nIdentical side-by-side tests were also performed on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s units. The results are similar: iOS 12 performs better, with the older model showing a greater improvement when running the newer operating system.\nThese don\u2019t forget, these comparisons are for prerelease versions of iOS 12. The final version is likely to offer even better performance. A comparison of iOS 12 beta 1 and iOS 12 beta 8 found moderate speed improvements.\nWe at Cult of Mac have been running the just-released iOS 12 beta 6 on an iPhone X, and have had no problems with speed or stability.",

        "body": "Apple first introduced its pride Apple Watch face during the company\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Inspired by the rainbow flag, it\u2019s designed to celebrate gay pride and stand against discrimination to LGBTQ people. While Apple regularly touts its \u201cunwavering commitment to equality and diversity\u201d in highly-produced gay pride videos, the company has its limits. iOS developer Guilherme Rambo has discovered that the pride Apple Watch face is \u201chardcoded to not show up if the paired iPhone is using the Russian locale.\u201d\nReddit users and Apple support forum users have been questioning the lack of a pride watch face in Russia over the past couple of months. The Verge has tested this on an iPhone running the latest iOS 12 beta, and the pride watch face simply disappears once you switch to the Russian locale.\nRussian\u2019s laws are likely to blame\nRussia implemented a \u201cgay propaganda\u201d law in 2013, which the European Court of Human Rights ruled reinforces prejudice and encourages homophobia. The law comes with the threat of jail time and fines for what Russia deems to be offensive speech. Apple appears to be avoiding this particular legal quandary. Apple sells a special pride edition Apple Watch strap, donating a portion of the proceeds toward LGBTQ advocacy organizations. But it doesn't sell it in Russia, either.\nGoogle targeted Russia\u2019s anti-gay laws with a rainbow Olympics homepage during the Winter Olympic Games in Russia in 2014. The Google homepage, including the Russian version, was changed to show a rainbow-inspired Google Doodle and the Olympic Charter, which calls for the Olympic spirit of no discrimination of any kind against every individual practicing sport.",

        "body": "Update: In a statement to TechCrunch\u2019s Matthew Panzarino, Apple says it is committed to protecting user privacy:\n\u201cWe work hard to protect user privacy and data security throughout the Apple ecosystem. With the latest update to our guidelines, we made it explicitly clear that apps should not collect information about which other apps are installed on a user\u2019s device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing and must make it clear what user data will be collected and how it will be used.\u201d\nFacebook is removing its controversial and spyware-like Onavo Protect application from the App Store. The Wall Street Journal reports today that Apple has ruled the app as being in violation of its data-collection policies.\nThe report explains that apple informed Facebook earlier this month that Onavo Protect violated new App Store Guidelines. Following that communication, Apple and Facebook officials met several times last week, with at least one of those meetings taking place at Apple Park, sources said.\nUltimately, Apple reportedly suggested to Facebook that it \u201cvoluntarily\u201d remove the Onavo Protect app from the App Store, to which Facebook agreed:\nThe two sides discussed the issue in meetings last week, at least one of which took place at Apple\u2019s headquarters. On Thursday, Apple officials suggested that Facebook voluntarily take down the Onavo app and Facebook agreed, said the person, who described the discussions as cordial.\nApple introduced new privacy rules as part of its App Store Guidelines back in June that specifically aim to limit collection of data by app developers. It\u2019s these changes in guidelines that seemingly gave Apple grounds to push Onavo Protect off the App Store.\nWhile Facebook touted Onavo Protect as a way for users to keep themselves and their data safe, what it actually did was create a VPN that directed user traffic through a Facebook-managed server:\nOnavo allows users to create a virtual private network that redirects internet traffic to a private server managed by Facebook. The app, which bills itself as a way to \u201ckeep you and your data safe,\u201d also alerts users when they visit potentially malicious sites. Facebook is able to collect and analyze Onavo users\u2019 activity to get a picture of how people use their phones beyond Facebook\u2019s apps.\nFacebook currently plans to remove the app from the App Store at some point this evening. While users who have already downloaded it will continue to be able to use it, Facebook won\u2019t be able to push updates to the app. Facebook currently has no plans to remove Onavo from the Google Play Store.\nRelated Stories:\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Idle Android Devices Send Data to Google Nearly 10 Times More Often Than iOS Devices do to Apple, Research Finds",
        "body": "Idle Android devices typically send data ten times more often to Google than iOS devices do to Apple's servers, according to new research shared by trade association Digital Content Next.\nIn a paper titled \"Google Data Collection,\" Douglas C. Schmidt, a computer science professor at Vanderbilt University, arrives at some stark conclusions regarding how much Google is collecting about consumers who use the company's products, even when they aren't interacting with their smartphones and tablets.\nAmong several findings, Schmidt's experiments found that an idle Android phone with Chrome web browser active in the background communicated location information to Google 340 times during a 24-hour period. An equivalent experiment found that on an iOS device with Safari open but not Chrome, Google could not collect any appreciable data unless a user was interacting with the device.\nIn addition, he found that an idle Android phone running Chrome sends back to Google nearly fifty times as many data requests per hour as an idle iPhone running Safari. Overall, an idle Android device was found to communicate with Google nearly 10 times more often than an Apple device communicates with Apple servers.\nAs well as data transmission frequencies, Schmidt's research also turned up some of the ways that Google can potentially tie together anonymous data collected through passive means with the personal information of its users.\nFor example, on an Android device, so-called \"anonymous\" advertising identifiers that collect activity data on apps and third-party web page visits can get associated with a user's real Google identity by the passing of device-level identification information to Google servers.\nThe same goes for the supposedly user-anonymous DoubleClick cookie ID, which tracks a user's activity on third-party web pages. According to Schmidt's research, Google can associate the cookie to a user's Google account when a user accesses a Google app in the same browser that a third-party web page was accessed.\nThe research follows a recent investigation conducted by the Associated Press which revealed that Google continues to track location data even after a consumer has turned off the setting in many of its apps, including Google Maps.\nIn response to a query about location history tracking, Google said that it is clear about its location policies, yet the company continues to collect data through app features that come under \"My Activity\" even when its \"Location History\" setting is turned off. The practice has since led to a class action lawsuit against the company by a user arguing breach of privacy.\nLocation information stored in \"My Activity\" is used for ad targeting purposes, which is still Google's primary business model. In contrast, Apple uses differential privacy to gather anonymous usage insights from devices like iPhones, iPads, and Macs, allowing it to crowdsource data from a large number of users without compromising the privacy of any individual.\nApple says the data it collects off-device is used to improve services like Siri suggestions, and to help identify problematic websites that use excessive power or too much memory in Safari, but the data is randomized before being sent from devices, so that its servers never see or receive raw data from users.\nWhen users set up their device, Apple explicitly asks users if they wish to provide usage information on an opt-in basis. If a user declines, no data is collected by Apple unless they choose to opt in at a later time.\nApple executives have said several times that Apple customers are not the company's product, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has maintained that privacy is a fundamental human right. The company also has a dedicated privacy website that explains its approach to privacy, outlines tools available to customers to protect their privacy, and details government data requests.",

        "title": "Redesigning Siri and adding multitasking features to iOS",
        "body": "\u00ab Hey Siri, help me \u00bb\nThe first part of this concept is focused on Siri. The idea here is not to create new commands, rather to display existing vocal requests that work well (like \u00ab Find me a good restaurant nearby \u00bb or \u00ab Get me pictures of Japan I took last year \u00bb) in a different way so they could be more useful to the user.\nIn iOS Mogi, Siri has been designed around a concept I call parallel help. The idea is to have a vocal assistant that is non-intrusive (it won\u2019t take the whole screen like it does today), context aware, and can do things in the background for the user while they are doing something else.\nAs images are more explicit than words, here\u2019s a very simple example:\nUsing Siri in Messages.\nWhen using apps, Siri takes the shape of a notification so as to be less intrusive as possible (if summoned from the lock screen or the home screen, it will still be fullscreen).\nSiri in iOS Mogi.\nIn the example above, I ask Siri to show me pictures of Japan as I want to send one to my friend Yannick. Once the request is fulfilled, the result is displayed in the Siri notification so I can continue to do what I was doing without being interrupted. I can swipe down the notification to reveal more and select the photos I want to send.\nSelecting pictures before sending them.\nOr, I can directly drag a picture from the expanded notification to the app below (finally putting to contribution the drag-and-drop API on the iPhone):\nDragging a photo from Siri to Messages. To cancel the drag-and-drop, drag the object to the screen\u2019s borders.\nIf it has not been used for a while, the notification shrinks down to the top:\nShrinking down.\nAnd it is possible to open it again by swiping down from the top of the screen (we\u2019ll come back to it later):\nOpening Siri again. The last request pops up again.\nWhat\u2019s really cool about the new Siri is that the results it displays can be used in another app very easily if needed:\nWhen switching between apps, the result of the request remains accessible so it can be used again.\nI believe designing Siri to be non-intrusive allows for so many use cases and could make a real difference with its competitors, thanks to its deep integration into the OS. Here\u2019s a few examples of what could be achieved with this new Siri:\nIn response to \u201cFind restaurants nearby\u201d. Tap the bubble for more info, or drag to share it. Swipe to see other restaurants nearby.\nProactive Siri. If Siri detects an address or determines you are running late, it pops up and lets you take actions. In this case, tap the notification to send a message to Craig, or swipe down the notification to see your options. An action sheet will let the user choose between their favorite messaging apps.\nAnd there\u2019s even more to it. In iOS Mogi, it is possible to ask Siri to show pages from an app while doing something else on another one. So, for instance, I could be writing an email and wanting to add a picture that a friend sent me on iMessage. Here\u2019s what it would look like in iOS Mogi:\nOpening a conversation while writing an email thanks to Siri.\nThat\u2019s the beginning of a true multitasking on a mobile device, and I think it is more adapted to the mobile limitations than just vertically splitting the screen in 2.\n\u00ab Hey Siri, I want to\u2026 \u00bb\nYou know how sometimes, you feel frustrated when you try to send a message with Siri, and end up taking your phone and typing your text? In iOS Mogi, instead of relying completely on Siri to do things for you, you can ask it to help you get things done faster. No more wandering in the UI, simply begin your sentence with \u00ab I want to\u2026 \u00bb and Siri will let you do it, without leaving what you were doing (in iOS Mogi, what you are doing is really precious).\nWriting a message to Yannick while writing an email.\nAnd it works right from the lock screen:\nWriting to Yannick from the Lock Screen with Siri.\n\u00ab Hey Siri, scroll down a bit \u00bb\nWith Siri now being completely non-intrusive, new use cases show up. One of them is Siri actions.\nSiri actions basically translate any touch gestures into voice commands. From the tap to the scroll, everything can now be performed using solely vocal requests. So I can ask Siri to scroll down my list of albums for instance, and open High as Hope from Florence + The Machine.\nNavigating in Apple Music with Siri.\nElementary use cases like this one were previously not possible as Siri would take the whole screen and would not be context aware. Now, when writing an email for instance, I can ask Siri to change the recipient on the go, modify my signature, or even change the style while I am writing my email:\nEditing an email on the go with Siri.\nI think it would be a huge step forward for disabled people in particular. Siri actions would make it easier than ever for them to navigate in the OS. Even for non-disabled people, I think it would be really useful when hands are busy, like when cooking for example, or just to make some redundant tasks easier (as seen above in Mail).\nAnd things could go even further thanks to ARKit 2 which has proved to be precise enough to track the eye (but let\u2019s try to keep things simple for this concept):\nI believe that Siri actions are very coherent with the initial approach of Siri, which was to allow users to perform simple actions with their voice. Making Siri non-intrusive just takes it a step further.\nSiri actions also come with a new ability for Siri: saving elements from anywhere to use them elsewhere. Open a photo, and say \u00ab Save this photo \u00bb for Siri to save it.\nAsk Siri to save elements and it will keep them for you.\nOpen another app, and drag the photo from the Siri notification to the app:\nDragging a saved picture in Medium.\nAnd it works for copy-pasting too:\nWhen content is copied from somewhere, it appears in a Siri notification so it can be used elsewhere easily. Swipe down the notification to see all of your previous saved content, like text, images, or emails.\nSimply tap to paste your text in the current app where the cursor is at. You can also drag the content to where you want:\nPasting content from Notes to Medium in a second thanks to Siri.\nYou can ask Siri to show you all your saved elements with the sentence \u00ab Show me all my saved elements \u00bb:\nJust ask \u201cShow me my saved elements\u201d and Siri will display them in front of you. You can drag them onto the app below or tap them to edit before use.\nOnce saved elements are used elsewhere, they disappear from the list.\nAnd that\u2019s it for the new Siri. Now, what if we applied the same principles of non-intrusive multitasking to other areas in the OS? Surely, the new gestures and visual code could be applied elsewhere. What could we do with it? Before digging further into this idea, let\u2019s see if we can improve the experience in a particular area where I personally spend a lot of time: Apple Maps.",

        "body": "The Apple logo is seen on a computer screen in this illustration photo taken in Bordeaux, France, February 1, 2017. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\nBy Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) - Apple Inc has acquired a startup focused on making lenses for augmented reality glasses, the company confirmed on Wednesday, a signal Apple has ambitions to make a wearable device that would superimpose digital information on the real world.\nApple confirmed it acquired Longmont, Colorado-based Akonia Holographics. \"Apple buys smaller companies from time to time, and we generally don't discuss our purpose or plans,\" the iPhone maker said in a statement.\nAkonia could not immediately be reached for comment. The company was founded in 2012 by a group of holography scientists and had originally focused on holographic data storage before shifting its efforts to creating displays for augmented reality glasses, according to its website.\nIn augmented reality, digital information is overlaid on the real world as in the popular game Pokemon Go. Mobile phones use their camera system to do this on the phone's screen, but major technology firms are racing to create glasses that will show digital information on transparent lenses.\nAkonia said its display technology allows for \"thin, transparent smart glass lenses that display vibrant, full-color, wide field-of-view images.\" The firm has a portfolio of more than 200 patents related to holographic systems and materials, according to its website.\nAkonia also said it raised $11.6 million in seed funding in 2012 and was seeking additional funding. It was unclear whether that funding ever materialized or who the firm's investors were.\nThe purchase price and date of the acquisition could not be learned, though one executive in the augmented reality industry said the Akonia team had become \"very quiet\" over the past six months, implying that the deal may have happened in the first half of 2018.\nApple has a history of buying smaller companies whose technologies show up years later in its products. In 2013, Apple acquired a small Israeli firm called PrimeSense that made three-dimensional sensors. The iPhone X, launched last year, used a similar sensor to power facial recognition features.\nStory continues\nBloomberg last year reported that Apple was developing augmented reality glasses that could ship as early as 2020. Apple declined to comment on its plans or products.\nBut the company last year launched augmented reality applications for its iPhones and iPads, and CEO Tim Cook has called augmented reality a \"big and profound\" technology development.\n\"This is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it,\" Cook said of augmented reality on a conference call with investors last year.\nThe Akonia acquisition is the first clear indication of how Apple might handle one of the most daunting challenges in augmented reality hardware: Producing crystal clear optical displays thin and light enough to fit into glasses similar to everyday frames with images bright enough for outdoor use and suited to mass manufacturing at a relatively low price.\nAugmented reality headsets currently on the market such as Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) HoloLense and startup Magic Leap's Magic Leap One both use darkened lenses and are intended for indoor use. Both are also intended for software developers testing the technology and cost several thousand dollars.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Cynthia Osterman)",

        "body": "On August 15, 1998, Apple officially released the first iMac, the candy-colored gumdrop-shaped iMac G3, launching a desktop machine that has continued to be updated and revised over the years.\nDesigned by Apple design chief Jony Ive, the iMac G3 was unique among computers at the time for its unusual shape, the use of translucent plastics that allowed the internals to be visible, and the bright colors that Apple adopted.\n\"This is iMac. The whole thing is translucent. You can see into it. It's so cool,\" said Jobs when introducing the iMac G3.\nApple's first iMac, which sold for $1,299 at launch, came equipped with a 233 - 700MHz PowerPC 750 G3 processor, 4GB of storage, a 15-inch CRT, a CD-ROM drive, and an ATI graphics card, components that don't sound impressive today but made for a powerful, well-rounded machine, that, in combination with the design, made the iMac a best seller.\nAt launch, and in the years following its release, Apple released the iMac G3 in a slew of shades that include the famous Bondi Blue, Blueberry, Grape, Graphite, Indigo, Lime, Sage, Strawberry, Ruby, Snow, Tangerine, and two patterned colors, Blue Dalmatian and Flower Power.\nIf you live near Michigan, all 13 colors of the original iMac G3 are on display at the Henry Ford Museum in a popup collection called \"Looking Through Things,\" which has been introduced in celebration of the iMac's anniversary.\nThe iMac G3 was introduced just a year after Steve Jobs returned to lead Apple, and it came at a time when the company was still struggling and trying to find its footing. By 1999, Apple saw its first quarter profits more than triple, with the jump attributed to sales of the new iMac.\nApple in May celebrated the anniversary of the debut of the iMac G3, which, while launched in August, was first introduced by Jobs in May 1998.\n20 years ago today, Steve introduced the world to iMac. It set Apple on a new course and forever changed the way people look at computers. pic.twitter.com/GbKno7YBHl \u2014 Tim Cook (@tim_cook) May 6, 2018\nSince the iMac G3's 1998 debut, Apple has introduced several revisions to the desktop machine, launching design revisions in 2002, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2012, and 2015.\nToday, the iMac is available in 21.5 and 27-inch size options, with 4K and 5K Retina displays, respectively. Kaby Lake chips, AMD graphics, and super fast SSDs are included.\nWe also have an iMac Pro, a workstation class machine aimed at Apple's professional users with a unique Space Gray body, Xeon processors with up to 18 cores, Radeon Pro Vega graphics, and up to 4TB of SSD storage.\nWe're still expecting refreshed iMac models in 2018. There's no word on when the next design change is coming, but in 2018, Apple is expected to add 8th-generation Coffee Lake chips and other internal improvements that make a great desktop machine even better.",

        "body": "Apple\u2019s AirPort line may be discontinued, but AirPort Express got one heck of an update today. Firmware update 7.8 for the latest AirPort Express hardware (2012 2nd-gen model, no longer sold) adds support for AirPlay 2 and Apple\u2019s Home app. The teaser for support has been present since iOS 11.4 beta, but support hasn\u2019t been live before today\u2019s version 7.8 firmware update.\nAirPort Express features a built-in AUX port that lets you wireless stream music to a connected speaker over line-out. The router has long been used as a solution for adding classic peer-to-peer AirPlay to traditional stereo systems, but there were no guarantees that AirPlay 2 would ever be supported.\nWith AirPlay 2 support, you can AirPlay from iOS to multiple AirPlay 2 speakers including HomePod, Apple TV-connected speakers, Sonos, and other AirPlay 2 targets. When assigned to a room through the Home app using HomeKit, you can also play music in a specific room using Siri.\nThe firmware update needed is available through the AirPort Utility app on iOS and macOS (although the iOS version remains letterboxed on iPhone X). AirPort Express is no longer sold by Apple, but you can still find refurb models from Best Buy or used elsewhere.\nAfter installing the latest firmware update, launch the Home app and add a new accessory to get started with room assignment. Choose the option to add an accessory without a code, then select the AirPort Express and give it a speaker name and room location.\nAirPlay 2 provides dramatically improved performance with lower latency and multi-room playback. Classic AirPlay suffered buffering issues and only worked with multi-room from iTunes on a Mac or PC.\nAirPlay 2 and Home support for AirPort Express works on both iOS 11.4.1 and iOS 12.\nSiri on HomePod controlling music on the iPod Hi-Fi \u2728 pic.twitter.com/54D61hrYO0 \u2014 Zac Hall (@apollozac) August 29, 2018\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Exclusive: Apple Watch Series 4 revealed \u2014 massive display, dense watch face, more",
        "body": "In addition to discovering exclusive iPhone XS details today, 9to5Mac can exclusively share the first look at the new Apple Watch Series 4. This is the new Apple Watch that we believe Apple will unveil at its special event announced earlier today.\nThe biggest change is the all-new edge-to-edge display. Apple has been rumored to be working on ~15% bigger displays for both sizes of Apple Watch \u2014 that rumor has been confirmed in the images we\u2019ve discovered. As expected, Apple has achieved this by dramatically reducing the bezel size around the watch display.\nIn addition to taking the display edge-to-edge, we\u2019re also looking at a brand new watch face capable of showing way more information than the current faces offered. The analog watch face shows a total of eight complications around the time and within the clock hands. While we haven\u2019t seen a new digital face yet, it\u2019s likely that Apple has designed more new watch faces to take advantage of the larger display.\nAlso seen in the image is a new hole between the side button and Digital Crown, likely an additional microphone, and compatibility with what appears to be current watch bands. Both the Digital Crown and side button appear modified from the current Apple Watch models as well.\nAgain, for another look at the new Apple Watch Series 4:\n(Not a mockup)\nWe\u2019ll learn much more about what will likely be called the Apple Watch Series 4 on September 12 when Apple is set to unveil its new hardware lineup.\nGuilherme Rambo contributed to this report.\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",
