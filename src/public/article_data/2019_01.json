        "title": "Tim Cook calls on FTC to let consumers track and delete their personal data.",
        "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook has called on the US government to introduce new tools to help users control the online data collected about their lives. Writing in an op-ed for Time magazine, Cook said consumers should have the power to \u201cdelete their data on demand, freely, easily and online, once and for all.\u201d\nIn the column Cook inveighed against what he called the \u201cshadow economy\u201d of data brokers: companies that collect and sell personal data generated by digital tracking. Cook repeated points he made in a speech last year, saying that the public needs new rights to manage this information. Personal data should be minimized, says Cook, it should be secure, and individuals should be able to access and delete it whenever they like.\n\u201cThis problem is solvable \u2014 it isn\u2019t too big, too challenging or too late.\u201d\n\u201cConsumers shouldn\u2019t have to tolerate another year of companies irresponsibly amassing huge user profiles, data breaches that seem out of control and the vanishing ability to control our own digital lives,\u201d writes Cook. \u201cThis problem is solvable \u2014 it isn\u2019t too big, too challenging or too late.\u201d\nAs head of a company that makes privacy a key selling point, Cook has long extolled the virtues of minimal data-collection. But in recent years, as scandals involving big tech companies like Facebook and smaller data brokers like Equifax, have brought shady practices into the light, his message has become more strident. It\u2019s moved from abstract discussions of the rights and wrongs of data collection to concrete calls for legislation.\nIn the op-ed today, Cook is explicit. He says new federal standards are needed, and calls on the Federal Trade Commission to create a \u201cdata-broker clearinghouse\u201d \u2014 a central facility where companies that collect and sell personal information would have to register their activities. This, writes Cook, would enable consumers to \u201ctrack the transactions that have bundled and sold their data from place to place, and [give] users the power to delete their data on demand, freely, easily and online, once and for all.\u201d\nCook is certainly not alone in advocating for this sort of regulation, but there is, as yet, no unified political will to introduce this sort of law. While politicians on both sides of the aisle are now calling for federal legislation of some sort, arguments about what this legislation might look like have only just begun.\nYesterday, for example, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) announced a new data privacy bill, the American Data Dissemination Act. The bill would allow the FTC to write new privacy recommendations for Congress, but would also override existing laws and state-level legislation, like those passed in California last year. This has worried some Democrat politicians, who say the proposal could end up \u201cthrowing the baby out with the bath water,\u201d while allowing big tech to write their own rules for data privacy.",

        "title": "Apple blocks Facebook from running its internal iOS apps",
        "body": "Apple has shut down Facebook\u2019s ability to distribute internal iOS apps, from early releases of the Facebook app to basic tools like a lunch menu. A person familiar with the situation tells The Verge that early versions of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and other pre-release \u201cdogfood\u201d (beta) apps have stopped working, as have other employee apps, like one for transportation. Facebook is treating this as a critical problem internally, we\u2019re told, as the affected apps simply don\u2019t launch on employees\u2019 phones anymore.\nThe shutdown comes in response to news that Facebook has been using Apple\u2019s program for internal app distribution to track teenage customers with a \u201cresearch\u201d app.\n\u201cA clear breach of [Facebook\u2019s] agreement with Apple\u201d\nThat app, revealed yesterday by TechCrunch, was distributed outside of the App Store using Apple\u2019s enterprise program, which allows developers to use special certificates to install more powerful apps onto iPhones. Those apps are only supposed to be used by a company\u2019s employees, however, and Facebook had been distributing its tracking app to customers. Facebook later said it would shut down the app.\nThis poses a huge issue for Facebook. While Apple provides other tools a company can use to install apps internally, Apple\u2019s enterprise program is the main solution for widely distributing internal apps and services. In an email, a Facebook spokesperson said \u201cI can confirm that this affects our internal apps.\u201d\nIn a statement given to Recode, Apple said that Facebook was in \u201cclear breach of their agreement with Apple.\u201d Any developer that breaches that agreement, Apple said, has their distribution certificates revoked, \u201cwhich is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.\u201d Apple declined to comment on shutting down all of Facebook\u2019s internal apps in an email to The Verge.\nRevoking a certificate not only stops apps from being distributed on iOS, but it also stops apps from working. And because internal apps by the same organization or developer may be connected to a single certificate, it can lead to immense headaches like the one Facebook now finds itself in where a multitude of internal apps have been shut down.\nApple and Facebook have already been bickering over privacy, but this is the first instance of Apple taking an action that directly shuts down some of Facebook\u2019s activities. Last March, Apple CEO Tim Cook criticized Facebook\u2019s handling of the Cambridge Analytica data sharing scandal, saying, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in this situation\u201d if he were running the company. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg later said the comments were \u201cextremely glib\u201d and spoke of Apple as a company that \u201cwork[s] hard to charge you more.\u201d",

        "title": "Major iPhone FaceTime bug lets you hear the audio of the person you are calling, before they pick up",
        "body": "UPDATE: Apple has taken Group FaceTime offline in an attempt to address the issue in the interim.\nA significant bug has been discovered in FaceTime and is currently spreading virally over social media. The bug lets you call anyone with FaceTime, and immediately hear the audio coming from their phone \u2014 before the person on the other end has accepted or rejected the incoming call. Apple says the issue will be addressed in a software update \u201clater this week\u201d.\nNaturally, this poses a pretty big privacy problem as you can essentially listen in on any iOS user, although it still rings like normal, so you can\u2019t be 100% covert about it. Nevertheless, there is no indication on the recipient\u2019s side that you could hear any of their audio. There\u2019s a second part to this which can expose video too \u2026\n9to5Mac has reproduced the FaceTime bug with an iPhone X calling an iPhone XR, but it is believed to affect any pair of iOS devices running iOS 12.1 or later.\nHere\u2019s how to do the iPhone FaceTime bug:\nStart a FaceTime Video call with an iPhone contact.\nWhilst the call is dialling, swipe up from the bottom of the screen and tap Add Person.\nAdd your own phone number in the Add Person screen.\nYou will then start a group FaceTime call including yourself and the audio of the person you originally called, even if they haven\u2019t accepted the call yet.\nIt will look like in the UI like the other person has joined the group chat, but on their actual device it will still be ringing on the Lock screen.\nWhilst the call is ringing, swipe up from the bottom of the screen and add yourself to the call.\nThe damage potential here is real. You can listen in to soundbites of any iPhone user\u2019s ongoing conversation without them ever knowing that you could hear them. Until Apple fixes the bug, it\u2019s not clear how to defend yourself against this attack either aside from disabling FaceTime altogether.\nAs it stands, if your phone is ringing with an incoming FaceTime request, the person on the other end could be listening in.\nWhat we have also found is that if the person presses the Power button from the Lock screen, their video is also sent to the caller \u2014 unbeknownst to them. In this situation, the receiver can now hear your own audio, but they do not know they are transmitting their audio and video back to you. From their perspective, all they can see is accept and decline. (Another update: It seems there are other ways of triggering the video feed eavesdrop too.)\nWe have also replicated the problem with an iPhone calling a Mac. By default, the Mac rings for longer than a phone so it can act as a bug for an even longer duration.\nApple has said the issue will be fixed in a software update later in the week. Until then, if you are concerned, you should disable FaceTime in iOS Settings.\nNow you can answer for yourself on FaceTime even if they don\u2019t answer\ud83e\udd12#Apple explain this.. pic.twitter.com/gr8llRKZxJ \u2014 Benji Mobb\u2122 (@BmManski) January 28, 2019\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "body": "Tim Cook is reportedly hosting an all-hands meeting with every Apple employee today about the revelations regarding stalling iPhone sales.\nThe news caused Apple shares to plummet in after-hours trading, taking some Apple suppliers with it. As part of the meeting, Cook will spell out what the news means, and take questions from employees.\nCook\u2019s revelation about the fact that the latest iPhones aren\u2019t selling to expectations \u2014 particularly in China \u2014 caused the company to revise its earnings. The reduced earnings cut the amount of money Apple expected to rake in for the holiday quarter by $9 billion.\n\u201cThis is probably one of the hardest things Tim Cook has had to do as CEO, putting out that letter today,\u201d Michael Gartenberg, a former Apple marketing executive, told Bloomberg after the release of yesterday\u2019s letter. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives called it, \u201cthe most defining moment of Cook\u2019s career.\u201d\nWhat happens next is going to be interesting to watch. Apple will be keen to prove that its disappointing quarterly earnings are not part of a wider trend. We may also see reduced iPhone prices, more emphasis on Apple\u2019s other products, and potentially a revised strategy that focuses less on the unpredictable China.\nWhat do you expect to be the upshot of yesterday\u2019s revelations?

        "title": "AirPower officially misses 2018 deadline, Apple silent on its status.",
        "body": "As the new year begins in Pacific Time, where Apple\u2019s Cupertino headquarters are based, the AirPower charging mat has officially missed its 2018 release window.\nThe charging mat promised to charge iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods on a single compact mat with flexibility on where devices can be placed. However, the product has been rumored to have faced internal development challenges as late as this past summer, which prevented Apple from bringing the product to market as smoothly as it expected.\nThe AirPower mat distinguished itself from standard single-device Qi charging mats in several ways. Most significantly, Apple advertised that the mat could charge a Watch, AirPods, and an iPhone \u2014 and also support an alternate configuration where the mat charged two iPhones simultaneously.\nThe AirPower mat would also coordinate with its charging iOS devices to display charging percentages on the iPhone lock screen.\nHere\u2019s how Apple SVP Phil Schiller positioned the mat at the iPhone X event in September 2017:\nWe hope people love it, that it encourages others to create more advanced solutions based on technology like this. We\u2019re going to be working with the Qi standards team to incorporate these benefits into the future of the standards to make wireless charging better for everyone. So look for the AirPower charger next year.\nClearly, Apple neither launched the mat in 2018 nor has the Qi standard seen any contribution to date from Apple on how to charge multiple devices simultaneously, without clear sweet spots for where the devices must be placed. Apple is also yet to nail down availability for the companion AirPods wireless charging case.\nAside from availability, Apple has also remained mum on pricing. At this point, it\u2019s not clear whether AirPower has been cancelled altogether or is still expected to debut sometime soon. At the end of last year, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seemed confident that the product could be released in the first quarter.\nUnusually, Apple has not provided a statement to press with an update on AirPower\u2019s status. Apple refused to acknowledge the product at its September and October events, and has not responded to press requests for comment at the end of December. The product therefore enters 2019 still in limbo.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Apple CEO Tim Cook: 'I Do Think Price is a Factor' in Declining iPhone Upgrades",
        "body": "During today's earnings call for the first fiscal quarter of 2019, Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked whether he thought that the pricing of the iPhone XR, XS, and \u200ciPhone\u200c XS Max was too high.\nIn response, Cook said that while he didn't feel that was as much of a factor in the United States, it was an issue in emerging markets.\nThe \u200ciPhone\u200c XS is priced the same as the \u200ciPhone\u200c X at $999, while the \u200ciPhone\u200c XS Max, a new device, was $100 more. The XR, at $749, was priced to be right in the middle of the entry level \u200ciPhone\u200c 8 and \u200ciPhone\u200c 8 Plus models. Cook said that's a \"pretty small difference in the United States compared to last year.\"\nIn emerging markets, however, \u200ciPhone\u200c pricing was an issue due to the strength of the dollar. Foreign exchange rates amplified the pricing increases leading to weaker sales. Cook says that in January, in some locations, the company has absorbed all or part of the currency movements compared to a year ago, getting closer to local price compared to a year ago.\nCook in an interview with Reuters earlier today said that Apple is lowering iPhone prices in some emerging markets.\nIn developed markets, like Japan, a lack of subsidies has also become a major factor. Even in the U.S., where subsidies have been phased out for several years, Cook said that a person who last purchased an \u200ciPhone\u200c 6 or 6s for $199 when subsidies were still in place may be reluctant to upgrade to a device that costs upwards of $749 without subsidies.\nApple is working to address the subsidy issue with trade-ins and installment payments.\nCook in a separate statement said all of Apple's devices are designed to last. \"We do design our products to last as long as possible,\" he said. Some customers choose to hold on to those products for as long as possible, while some trade them in. Apple's product cycle has indeed extended and upgrades were less than anticipated last quarter, but Cook says he doesn't know where that will go in the future.\n\"I'm convinced that making a great product that is high quality is the best thing for the customer. That's the way we look at it.\"",

        "body": "Apple's long-awaited wireless charging mat AirPower might finally be on the horizon if the latest rumor is to be believed.\nHong Kong website ChargerLAB cites a \"credible source\" within Apple's supply chain who claims Chinese manufacturer Luxshare Precision has started production of the AirPower. In a conversation on Chinese messaging app WeChat, the source adds he has heard the AirPower will be released soon.\nBreaking: AirPower is finally coming. We just learned from credible source in supply chain that the manufacture Luxshare Precision has already started producing Apple AirPower wireless charging pad. Luxshare Precision is also the maker of Apple AirPods and USB-C cables. pic.twitter.com/UqgWIAh3sx \u2014 ChargerLAB (@chargerlab) January 12, 2019\nMacRumors translated the Chinese messages in the WeChat screenshot using the Google Translate app for photos on iPhone and they appear to be consistent with what ChargerLAB claims in its tweet.\nLuxshare is a member of the Wireless Power Consortium behind the Qi standard and also assembles AirPods for Apple \u2014 and Lightning to USB-C cables, according to ChargerLAB. Reports had suggested Luxshare would be a primary supplier of the AirPower since as early as February 2017.\nLuxshare might not be the only supplier, as a report last year said Pegatron would also be involved in production.\nA few weeks ago, developer Steve Troughton-Smith said he's heard Apple may have overcome technical challenges with the AirPower and could move forward with a release. Those technical challenges included overheating and interference issues, according to Sonny Dickson, an occasional source of Apple leaks.\nWhere is AirPower? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f All I\u2019ve been hearing is \u2018they\u2019ve finally fixed it\u2019, so, if true, it could ship as a product whenever Apple wants. Hopefully alongside the smart battery case for the XS? \u2014 Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) December 31, 2018\nBack in October, in a research note obtained by MacRumors, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple may launch the AirPower by early in the first quarter of 2019 , suggesting that the accessory may be released soon.\nThe delayed release of the AirPower is likely why Apple has yet to release its optional wireless charging case for AirPods, which remains listed as \"currently unavailable\" on Apple's website. Like the AirPower, Kuo said the wireless case may be released in early 2019 ahead of an entirely new pair in 2020.\nAirPower is an oval-shaped mat that would be able to wirelessly charge multiple Apple devices at once, including the iPhone 8 and newer, Apple Watch Series 3 and newer, and AirPods when they are placed in the aforementioned wireless charging case that has been expected to launch alongside the mat.\nApple first previewed the AirPower at Steve Jobs Theater in September 2017, shortly after introducing the iPhone X, and indicated that it would be released at some point in 2018 in a press release. Apple failed to deliver on that promise, however, and hasn't commented on the AirPower for many months.\nFollowing its September 2018 event, Apple removed all but a few mentions of the AirPower from its website. The mat was, however, still referenced in the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR user guides, in some recent Apple job listings, and in a few recent Apple patent applications.\nApple's silence regarding AirPower has led some to believe the product has been canceled, but today's report offers renewed hope.\nLast month, based on documentation obtained from Made for iPhone program members, ChargerLAB accurately reported that third-party Apple-certified Lightning to USB-C cables would be available in early 2019. Right on cue, Belkin and Griffin among others introduced Lightning to USB-C cables at CES 2019 this week.\nChargerLAB did, however, inaccurately report that the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR would be bundled with a faster 18W USB-C power adapter from Apple. The website did show an accurate render of the charger, but it ended up being for the 2018 iPad Pro, so the rumor wasn't entirely off base.\nUpdate: In a follow-up tweet, ChargerLAB cites another source who claims a second Apple supplier Pegatron is set to begin mass production of the AirPower on January 21. The alleged Pegatron employee claims the AirPower has three layers of coils in an 8-7-7 configuration from bottom to top.",

        "body": "In addition to addressing the iPhone XR and Apple\u2019s ever-growing wearables business on CNBC, Tim Cook also talked about Apple\u2019s increasing interest in services and health care. The Apple CEO teased that Apple has new services coming this year\u2026\nOn CNBC\u2019s Mad Money, Jim Cramer asked Cook how Apple planned to further grow its Services business \u2013 perhaps even to the point that it is 40 percent of the company. As usual, Cook wouldn\u2019t go into specifics, but he did tease that Apple has new offerings in the services business coming this year:\nOn services, you will see us announce new services this year. There will more things coming. I don\u2019t wanna tell you about what they are and I\u2019m not gonna forecast precisely, the ramps and so forth. But they\u2019re things that we feel really great about, that we\u2019ve been working on for multiple years.\nApple is rumored to have a news subscription service launching soon, using the Texture magazine platform it acquired last year. Further, Apple continues to develop its original video content, which is also expected to launch in 2019 at some point.\nTim Cook also addressed Apple\u2019s growing interest in health care, saying that in the future when people ask what Apple\u2019s \u201cgreatest contribution to mankind was,\u201d it will be about health initiatives:\nOn healthcare in particular and your wellbeing, this is an area that I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, \u201cWhat was Apple\u2019s greatest contribution to mankind,\u201d it will be about health. Because our business has always been about enriching people\u2019s lives. And as we\u2019ve gotten into healthcare more and more through the Watch and through other things that we\u2019ve created with ResearchKit and CareKit and putting your medical records on the iPhone, this is a huge deal. And it\u2019s something that is very important for people. We are democratizing it. We are taking what has been with the institution and empowering the individual to manage their health. And we\u2019re just at the front end of this. But I do think, looking back, in the future, you will answer that question, Apple\u2019s most important contribution to mankind has been in health.\nYou can read Tim Cook\u2019s full interview with CNBC here or below.\nApple CEO Tim Cook talks China, Wall Street negativity and innovation with CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer from CNBC.\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Apple replaced 11 million iPhone batteries in 2018, up from its usual of 1-2 million",
        "body": "Following Apple\u2019s revision to its Q1 2019 earnings, it was revealed that Tim Cook would hold an all-hands meeting to discuss the results with Apple employees. While the majority of the details from that meeting have yet to leak, John Gruber at Daring Fireball today has an interesting tidbit.\nDuring the all-hands meeting, Tim Cook reportedly stated that Apple replaced 11 million batteries over the duration of the $29 replacement program. During a normal year, Apple plans to replace around between 1 and 2 million batteries, Cook said during the meeting.\nThe $29 replacement initiative was active for almost exactly a year. This means in 2018, Apple replaced as as high as 11 times the number of batteries it usually replaces in a year.\nDuring Apple\u2019s all-hands meeting January 3, Tim Cook said Apple replaced 11 million batteries under the $29 replacement program, and they\u2019d have only anticipated about 1-2 million battery replacements normally.\nGruber shared this factoid while linking to a piece from Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e on the effects of Apple\u2019s battery program on iPhone sales. While it\u2019s easy to argue that Apple\u2019s battery program should have been baked into Apple\u2019s Q1 2019 expectations, Gruber makes a good point:\nMy guess: the effect of the battery replacement program on new iPhone sales wasn\u2019t apparent until after the iPhone XR and XS models were available. A few million extra iPhone users happy with the performance of their old iPhones with new batteries \u2014 who would have otherwise upgraded to a new iPhone this year \u2014 put a ding in the bottom line.\nOther details from Cook\u2019s all-hands meeting remain unclear, but hopefully, we\u2019ll learn a bit more as time progresses.\nRelated stories:\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Face ID, Touch ID unlocks can't be compelled by law enforcement, rules federal judge",
        "body": "Article Hero Image\nThe police cannot force a person to unlock their iPhone with Face ID or Touch ID, a U.S. federal judge has ruled, a move that effectively provides users the same protection for the biometric security for their devices as previously afforded to passcodes.\nIn the United States, a suspect's property has the potential to be searched by law enforcement officials as part of an investigation, but some items are typically left alone. While people are protected from having to unlock their devices via a passcode, biometric security has been considered fair game for use by investigators, bypassing the passcode rules.\nA January 10 filing in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California applying for a search warrant for a residence in Oakland reveals investigators wanted to look into the affairs of suspects in an alleged blackmail attempt, where they were claimed to have threatened to \"distribute an embarrassing video\" of the victim unless a payment was made.\nAs part of the warrant request, there was also a request to compel individuals present in the search to use a fingerprint reader, facial recognition, or iris recognition to unlock devices found on the property. In the filing, the court denies the request, as it \"runs afoul of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments,\" specifically in relation to unlocking devices.\nJudge Kanis Westmore deemed the request was too \"overbroad\" due to not being limited to any particular computers or devices owned by an individual or multiple persons. More importantly, Westmore declared the government and its agents were not allowed to use biometrics to force an unlock of a device, due to the potential for self-incrimination.\nThe problem is that, while a user can state a passcode as a \"testimonial communication,\" biometrics do not count in the same way, as they can easily be acquired via unwilling means. For example, it would be feasible for Touch ID to be triggered by forcibly holding a finger to the Home button for reading, or for Face ID to be defeated by the suspect being forced to look in the TrueDepth camera's direction for a moment.\n\"If a person cannot be compelled to provide a passcode because it is testimonial communication, a person cannot be compelled to provide one's finger, thumb, iris, face, or other biometric feature to unlock that same device,\" wrote Westmore. \"The undersigned finds that a biometric feature is analogous to the 20 nonverbal, physiological responses elicited during a polygraph test, which are used to determine guilt or innocence, and are considered testimonial.\"\nWhile this does effectively block one avenue of evidence collection for the law enforcement agents, it doesn't completely stop the investigation from going down that route. The ruling could be overturned in the future, a second narrower warrant could be requested, or the government could make a request for the data from Facebook itself.\nSince the introduction of biometric security to iPhones and other smartphones, there have been reports of law enforcement agencies taking advantage of the technology to gain access to mobile devices, with the courts permitting their use in warrants.\nIn 2016, a woman was compelled to use her fingerprint to unlock an iPhone confiscated from a property owned by an Armenian Power gang member, one who at the time was in prison for unrelated charges. There have also been multiple instances where members of law enforcement have used fingers of corpses to attempt to access iPhones and obtain evidence, though with little success due to the amount of time that had passed since the last successful unlock.\nSuch actions are not limited to fingerprints. In August 2018, the FBI ordered the unlocking of an iPhone X using Face ID as part of a child abuse investigation in Columbus, Ohio. A forensic firm has also warned police to avoid looking at the screen of an iPhone X or other Face ID-secured device, or else potentially lose the ability to attempt a face-based unlock in the future.",

The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple will introduce a successor to the iPhone XR with an LCD display, alongside two other handsets. The high-end 2019 iPhone, presumably the largest of the three, is also rumored to include a triple-camera system at the rear, in an effort that\u2019s clearly designed to compete with the latest crop of Android handsets that include multiple cameras.\nRenders of a triple-camera iPhone leaked last week, with OnLeaks claiming Apple will introduce such a system later this year.

A person familiar with the situation told The Verge that early versions of Google Maps, Hangouts, Gmail, and other pre-release beta apps stopped working alongside employee-only apps like a Gbus app for transportation and Google\u2019s internal cafe app. The block came after Google was found to be in violation of Apple\u2019s app distribution policy, and followed a similar shutdown that was issued to Facebook earlier this week.\nTechCrunch and Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Bergen reported late Thursday that the apps\u2019 functionality had been restored; Apple appears to have worked more closely with Google to fix this situation. \u201cWe are working together with Google to help them reinstate their enterprise certificates very quickly,\u201d an Apple spokesperson earlier told BuzzFeed.\nApple blocked Facebook and then Google\nApple\u2019s move to block Google\u2019s developer certificate comes just a day after Google disabled its Screenwise Meter app following press coverage. Google\u2019s private app was designed to monitor how people use their iPhones, similar to Facebook\u2019s research app. Google\u2019s app also relied on Apple\u2019s enterprise program, which enables the distribution of internal apps within a company.\nIn an earlier statement over Facebook\u2019s certificate removal, Apple did warn that \u201cany developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked.\u201d Facebook\u2019s internal iOS apps have since resumed functioning, as the social network said this afternoon that Apple had restored its enterprise certificate.\nApple is clearly sticking to its rules and applying them equally to Facebook, Google, and likely many other companies that get caught breaking Apple\u2019s rules in the future.\nThere\u2019s growing evidence that a number of companies are using Apple\u2019s enterprise program to distribute apps to consumers. iOS developer Alex Fajkowski has discovered that Amazon, DoorDash, and Sonos all distribute beta versions of their apps to non-employees. Apple may be forced to take action against these apps, or to even revamp its entire enterprise program in the future.\nUpdate 1/31, 5:45PM ET: Article updated with comment from Google, Apple, and details on other companies using Apple\u2019s enterprise program to distribute apps.\nUpdate 1/31: 6:18PM ET: Updated with the news that Apple has resumed letting Facebook use internal iOS apps.",

        "title": "A Letter from Tim Cook to Apple Investors",
        "body": "January 2, 2019\nTo Apple investors:\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance.\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates.\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone X S and iPhone X S Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. Again, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected.\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated.\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both.\nEmerging Market Challenges\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\niPhone\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year.\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements.\nMany Positive Results in the December Quarter\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges.\nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers.\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales.\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth.\nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\nLooking Ahead\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result.\nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base.\nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\nTim",

        "title": "Apple gains patent for future iPhones and Apple Watches to act as poisonous gas and CO2 detectors",
        "body": "Apple has been granted a patent today which illustrates how future products such as iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch could have built-in sensors to detect harmful, poisonous gasses, such as CO or CO2 \u2014 often dubbed a silent killer due to its odorless, tasteless yet toxic state.\nWhile ingraining a physical gas sensor into a device requires another physical chassis opening \u2014 something Apple and the industry is clearly moving away from \u2014 it would be extremely interesting to see if the company could retain IP68 water-resistance on iPhone and Apple Watch with this theoretical feature built-in.\nVia PatentlyApple,\nApple\u2019s patent claim #9 points to a \u201ctarget gas consisting of at least one of ozone (O.sub.3), nitrogen dioxide (NO.sub.2), nitrogen monoxide (NO), sulfur dioxide (SO.sub.2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH.sub.4), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and wherein the components of a gas mixture other than the target gas comprises poisoning species including siloxanes, sulfates, phosphates and chlorides, and/or interfering species such as water vapor.\u201d\nSpecifically, the patent shows diagrams of a \u201cminiature gas sensing device encased in an enclosure\u201d. As for the \u201cenclosure\u201d, an Apple Watch is what\u2019s being used in the patent demonstration.\nClean air and tech have gone hand-in-hand in recent years. Besides the numerous smart air-purifiers on the market, Tesla launched a specialized HEPA filter for its vehicles, opening the door for a \u201cBioweapon Defense Mode\u201d filtration mode.\nOur own Guilherme Rambo keenly pointed out how considering the ease of building your own IoT smoke detector with an Arduino circuit board, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see the next Apple Watch feature gas-detecting abilities \u2014 again, provided water-resistance isn\u2019t impaired.\nThough water-resistant smoke detectors do exist, they\u2019re of course generally bulky and will require some significant shrinking before implementation into any wrist watch wearable or smartphone.\nWould you like to see a feature like this on your next iPhone or Apple Watch? How do you feel now that tech and health are merging so rapidly? Discuss in the comments section below!\nUpdate: As numerous readers have pointed out, there\u2019s a difference between carbon monoxide (CO) versus carbon dioxide (CO2). The patent specifically covers CO, the most common type of fatal poisoning in the world. As for whether the final release would detect both CO and CO2 remains to be seen, yet for the time being, the patent makes no mention of carbon dioxide, CO2.\nRelated stories:\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

(There are also USB-A to Lightning and USB-A to USB-C options, but those are decidedly less exciting.)\nThis is a big deal (to me, at least) since USB-C to Lightning cables are the only way to take advantage of fast charging on recent iPhone models, and until today, Apple hasn\u2019t let anyone else build one. (Due to how the MFi program works, if you want to have a Lightning plug on your product, you have to pay Apple\u2019s licensing fees and follow Apple\u2019s rules.)\nBut now, there is a second option. Belkin is offering four-foot, six-foot and 10-foot cables in a speckled black or white design. At between $24.99 to $34.99, depending on the cable length, Belkin\u2019s cables aren\u2019t actually cheaper than Apple\u2019s, but its at least a start. And with a 10-foot length option that\u2019s longer than anything Apple offers, it shows how third-party cables can provide features or functionality that Apple\u2019s cables haven\u2019t.\nHopefully, now that the interdict appears to have been lifted, cheaper USB-C to Lightning cables will follow soon. The new cables also won\u2019t be shipping until sometime this spring, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\nAlong with the new charging cables, Belkin also announced a few other products at CES. There\u2019s a pair of BoostCharge USB-C chargers, one meant for cars and another standard wall plug, both of which can output up to 27W of power. There\u2019s also a new BoostCharge USB-C battery pack, which offers 20,000mAh of charge, can output at up to 30W (enough to fast charge Apple\u2019s latest iPad Pros as well as power a Switch or a 12-inch MacBook), and features an additional 12W USB-A port, too. It\u2019ll cost $129.99 when it releases in the spring.",

        "body": "Apple has hired Soonho Ahn, a former Samsung executive who worked primarily on lithium-ion batteries and other battery-related technologies, Bloomberg reports. Ahn joined Apple in December after a four-year stint at Samsung.\nHe ran Samsung SDI, which, among other things, supplied Apple with device batteries a few years ago. Bloomberg also reports that Apple is in talks to buy cobalt \"directly from miners\"\u2014cobalt is needed to make these kinds of batteries. Both revelations suggest that Apple may be looking to make its own batteries rather than source them from other companies.\nIf there's one guiding product design and business philosophy at Apple, it's that minimizing the number of components and features that are dependent on third parties and other companies leads to a win-win\u2014better products and user experiences for customers, and more profit for the company.\nAdvertisement\nWe've observed before that lithium-ion batteries are like a ball and chain on the modern smartphone. The basic technology has remained unchanged for decades, and the rate of improvement has been slow compared to other components. It was throttling and battery issues that led to Apple's battery replacement program in 2018, and that program may have been a major factor in Apple's recent disappointing iPhone sales.\nApple has a lot of good reasons to zero in on improving and controlling the batteries in its devices, though it remains to be seen what, if anything, the company can substantially improve in this aged technology.\nWe've seen previous reports that Apple is working on in-house CPUs to replace Intel's chips in some or all of the Mac product line. We've also heard that Apple is looking at making its own MicroLED displays to reduce or end reliance on Samsung and other suppliers for its current LCD and OLED panels.\nApple has worked with its suppliers to come up with innovative battery solutions before\u2014for example, the space-saving, L-shaped battery in the iPhone XS. But by bringing everything in-house, the company can gain even more control over how its products are designed and built.",

        "title": "Apple Begins Selling iPhone SE Again on Clearance Store, Starting at $249 Brand New",
        "body": "Four months after Apple stopped selling the iPhone SE, the beloved device has made a sudden return to Apple's online store.\nApple is offering the iPhone SE with 32GB of storage for $249 and with 128GB of storage for $299 on its clearance store in the United States. These are brand new, unopened, and unlocked models with unchanged tech specs, including a 4-inch Retina display, A9 chip, Touch ID, and 12-megapixel rear camera.\nPrior to being pulled, the \u200ciPhone SE\u200c was available with 32GB and 128GB of storage for $349 and $449 respectively, so Apple is offering $100 to $150 off. The device was originally released in March 2016 and was popular among fans of smaller smartphones and those who preferred the iPhone 5-like design.\nIt's unclear why Apple is selling the \u200ciPhone SE\u200c again, but it would appear to be clearing out stock. The \u200ciPhone SE\u200c remains on sale at select authorized resellers, as reflected on Apple's compare iPhone models page when the \u200ciPhone SE\u200c is selected.\nOf course, with Apple recently lowering its revenue guidance for the quarter just ended due to fewer \u200ciPhone\u200c upgrades than it anticipated, speculation will certainly mount that Apple is doing everything it can to boost \u200ciPhone\u200c sales.\nWhile many customers have hoped for a so-called \u200ciPhone SE\u200c 2, with some rumors suggesting one was in the works, oft-accurate Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo cast doubt on the possibility of a new \u200ciPhone SE\u200c last year. And in July of last year, one research firm said Apple abandoned its plans for a new \u200ciPhone SE\u200c.\nApple is offering the iPhone SE in Silver, Space Gray, Gold, and Rose Gold, with delivery or in-store pickup available by next week.\nAs of now, this appears to be U.S. only.\nUpdate: \u200ciPhone SE\u200c stock is sold out as of Sunday morning.\nUpdate 1/23: Apple has additional \u200ciPhone SE\u200c models in stock as of Wednesday afternoon, but available supply may sell out quickly.",

        "body": "For the last couple of years, my wife and I have relied on an ancient Garmin GPS for long road trips, in part because it had a useful feature that Google Maps lacked: speed limits. We might end up switching soon, because Google has begun rolling out the feature to Google Maps on iOS and Android devices.\nThe new feature, spotted by Android Police (via Mashable), displays the posted speed limit on roads in the corner of the app, and also introduces an icon to denote the location of speed cameras. Mashable reports that drivers will get an audio notification when they\u2019re approaching a speed trap. The update is currently rolling out to users in Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the United States, while speed camera icons are rolling out to Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, UK, and US users.",

        "title": "Digitimes: AirPods 2 launching in first half of this year, redesigned to support \u2018health monitoring\u2019 features",
        "body": "The AirPods continue to be a smash hit sensation for Apple. However, having launched more than 2 years ago at this point, the focus in the tech community has moved to expectations as to when the AirPods 2 will come out, the first hardware update to Apple\u2019s wireless earbuds.\nA report from Digitimes today says Apple will release AirPods 2 within the first six months of 2019. Moreover, it claims that the earbuds will be redesigned to support health monitoring functions.\nDigitimes has a mixed record of accuracy when it comes to Apple product rumors. The idea of adding health features to AirPods has been speculated by analysts for a while, but this is the first significant supply chain rumor we\u2019ve heard on the subject.\nThe AirPods are so small that is hard to imagine what health monitoring features they could contain. A small accelerometer could potentially determine body movement but these angles are already well served by the Apple Watch and even the iPhone\u2019s always-on motion coprocessor.\nThe AirPods also have to contend with the fact they only can have tiny internal batteries inside the buds, which makes the inclusion of an optical heart rate monitor \u2014 for example \u2014 seem unfeasible.\nBloomberg previously said that higher-end AirPods would launch in early 2019, available as a more expensive option to the current $159 AirPods. It did not specify features. It is possible that this \u2018pro\u2019 variant is what Digitimes is describing. The Bloomberg report did make vague allusions to Apple experimenting with biometric sensors for AirPods, which would turn the product into a health wearable, but did not go into detail.\nOf course, Apple has been teasing the launch of the AirPods wireless charging case ever since September 2017 and is still yet to ship that accessory. Many believe the release of the charging case is held up by the repeated delays getting AirPower to market. The wireless charging case alone would not really constitute an \u2018AirPods 2\u2019, so we don\u2019t think that is what Digitimes is referring to.\nApple has always advertised the case as an optional extra, so that existing AirPods buyers can buy the new wireless case on its own. Perhaps, the AirPods 2 bundle the new case as standard.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "body": "Apple is United Airlines' biggest customer at the San Francisco International Airport, according to signs the airline has available that were shared on Twitter today.\nAccording to United, Apple spends $150 million on airline tickets each year, and purchases 50 business class seats on flights to Shanghai every day.\nApple has many suppliers in China, which explains why the company sends so many employees to the Shanghai Pudong Airport.\nApple spends $35 million each year on flights from SFO to Shanghai, which is the number one flight the company purchases. Other routes are also popular, with Apple employees flying between these top 10 locations frequently:\n1. Shanghai (PVG)\n2. Hong Kong (HKG)\n3. Taipei (TPE)\n4. London (LHR)\n5. South Korea (ICN)\n6. Singapore (SIN)\n7. Munich (MUC)\n8. Tokyo (HND)\n9. Beijing (PEK)\n10. Israel (TLV)\nApple has more than 130,000 employees across its retail and corporate locations, and its headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. The San Francisco International Airport, located near Millbrae, California and south of San Francisco, is the closest major airport for international flights.\nThis statistic accounts solely for the flights taken from SFO. Apple has campuses in other locations around the world, and the San Jose International Airport is also nearby, so this is likely just a fraction of the airline travel that Apple funds.\nAs The Verge's Nilay Patel points out, statistics like these are a reminder of the huge number of employees that Apple has working behind the scenes on the devices that we use every day.\nApple is by far the biggest United airline customer in the Bay Area, and its $150 million spending total far outranks Facebook, Roche, and Google, companies that each spend over $34 million on United flights annually.",
