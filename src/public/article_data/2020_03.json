        "body": "Apple today also introduced the new Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro. With a floating design with smooth angle adjustment, a backlit keyboard and trackpad, the Magic Keyboard delivers the best typing experience ever on iPad. The Magic Keyboard will be available for purchase in May.\n\u201cThe new iPad Pro introduces advanced technologies never before available in mobile computing,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. \u201cCombining the most advanced mobile display with powerful performance, pro cameras, pro audio, the breakthrough LiDAR Scanner and new Magic Keyboard with Trackpad, this is another huge leap forward for iPad. There\u2019s no other device in the world like the new iPad Pro and we think our customers are going to love it.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re making iPad even more capable and versatile by bringing trackpad support to iPadOS,\u201d said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Software Engineering. \u201cWe carefully considered the best way to integrate trackpad use into a touch-first environment while retaining everything our customers know and love about iPad. We\u2019re thrilled to bring this new way of interacting with iPad to the millions of people using iPadOS today.\u201d\nPro Performance with A12Z Bionic Chip\nBuilt for the most demanding tasks, like editing 4K video or designing 3D models, iPad Pro gets another performance boost with the new A12Z Bionic chip. The eight-core GPU in the A12Z Bionic, along with an enhanced thermal architecture and tuned performance controllers, gives iPad Pro the highest performance ever in an iPad. Combined with the eight-core CPU and the powerful Neural Engine, which enables next-generation apps, there\u2019s no other chip that can offer the incredible performance found in the thin and light design of iPad Pro. With great battery life lasting up to 10 hours,1 faster Wi-Fi connectivity2 and gigabit-class LTE that\u2019s 60 percent faster3 with support for more LTE bands than any other tablet, customers can stay productive and creative all day.",

        "title": "Zoom iOS app quietly sending data to Facebook, even if you have no account",
        "body": "Update: The app has now been updated to remove this data transfer. See below for an explanation from the company.\nThe Zoom iOS app is sharing data with Facebook, without declaring it in the privacy policy. This happens whether or not you have a Facebook account.\nData shared with Facebook includes your iPhone or iPad model, your time-zone, city, phone carrier and a unique identifier which can be used for ad-targeting \u2026\nThe discovery was made by Motherboard and confirmed by iOS security researcher Will Strafach.\nUpon downloading and opening the app, Zoom connects to Facebook\u2019s Graph API, according to Motherboard\u2019s analysis of the app\u2019s network activity. The Graph API is the main way developers get data in or out of Facebook [\u2026] Zoom is not forthcoming with the data collection or the transfer of it to Facebook. Zoom\u2019s policy says the company may collect user\u2019s \u201cFacebook profile information (when you use Facebook to log-in to our Products or to create an account for our Products),\u201d but doesn\u2019t explicitly mention anything about sending data to Facebook on Zoom users who don\u2019t have a Facebook account at all.\nThe piece notes that it\u2019s not uncommon for apps to use a Facebook SDK.\nThis sort of data transfer is not uncommon, especially for Facebook; plenty of apps use Facebook\u2019s software development kits (SDK) as a means to implement features into their apps more easily, which also has the effect of sending information to Facebook.\nWhat is not permitted by Facebook, however, is to do this without notifying users.\nZoom users may not be aware it is happening, nor understand that when they use one product, they may be providing data to another service altogether [\u2026] Facebook told Motherboard it requires developers to be transparent with users about the data their apps send to Facebook. Facebook\u2019s terms say \u201cIf you use our pixels or SDKs, you further represent and warrant that you have provided robust and sufficiently prominent notice to users regarding the Customer Data collection, sharing and usage,\u201d and specifically for apps, \u201cthat third parties, including Facebook, may collect or receive information from your app and other apps and use that information to provide measurement services and targeted ads.\u201d\nZoom is seeing record use during the coronavirus crisis, as both businesses and consumers use it to keep in touch via group video calls.\nIt\u2019s not the first time there has been a privacy issue with Zoom. A major vulnerability last year meant that websites were able to activate Mac webcams without first asking permission. And it was recently suggested that the host can monitor other apps in use, though this appears to apply only to corporately-managed machines.\nEveryone working remotely: ZOOM monitors the activity on your computer and collects data on the programs running and captures which window you have focus on. If you manage the calls, you can monitor what programs users on the call are running as well. It's fucked up. \u2014 Wolfgang \u02ac (@Ouren) March 21, 2020\nA the time of writing, the company had not commented on this issue with the Zoom iOS app.\nUpdate: Vice now reports that the Facebook code has been removed from Zoom.\n\u201cZoom takes its users\u2019 privacy extremely seriously. We originally implemented the \u2018Login with Facebook\u2019 feature using the Facebook SDK in order to provide our users with another convenient way to access our platform. However, we were recently made aware that the Facebook SDK was collecting unnecessary device data,\u201d Zoom told Motherboard in a statement on Friday.",

This means that if they\u2019re experiencing the COVID-19 symptoms, they can take the time that they need without having to worry about running out of sick days or providing a note to management.\nAs of right now, Apple retail stores are staying open during the coronavirus outbreak. Apple, however, is implementing crowd control measures to reduce density, such as limiting Genius Bar openings and canceling many Today at Apple sessions.\nOver the weekend, Tim Cook sent a memo to Apple employees about the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Cook told workers at Apple offices in California, Seattle, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom that they can work from home this week if their \u201cjob allows\u201d for it. Retail stores are staying open to service Apple customers, Cook said.\nThe coronavirus situation is evolving at a rapid pace, and it\u2019s always possible Apple ends up closing retail stores or dramatically reducing hours. It\u2019s also possible that policies currently in place change on a daily or case-by-case basis.\nRead more:",

Apple had already closed all of its stores in Italy and Spain, but stores in other countries like the United States have remained open until now.\nAs of today, all of our stores in Greater China have reopened. I also want to thank our operations team and partners for their remarkable efforts to restore our supply chain. What we\u2019ve learned together has helped us all develop the best practices that are assisting enormously in our global response. One of those lessons is that the most effective way to minimize risk of the virus\u2019s transmission is to reduce density and maximize social distance. As rates of new infections continue to grow in other places, we\u2019re taking additional steps to protect our team members and customers. We will be closing all of our retail stores outside of Greater China until March 27.\nCook says that customers who need to purchase devices or accessories can do so on Apple's website or through the Apple Store app. Customers who need service and support can use Apple's support site.\nApple plans to continue to pay its hourly workers during the store closures and has expanded leave policies to accommodate personal or family health circumstances created by COVID-19, including recovering from an illness, caring for a sick loved one, mandatory quarantining, or childcare challenges.",

        "title": "Apple tells retail employees not to offer AirPods or Apple Watch try-ons as coronavirus precaution",
        "body": "Apple is rolling out additional changes to its retail store practices as the coronavirus pandemic continues. Business Insider reports that Apple Store employees are being told not to offer Apple Watch or AirPods try-ons for the foreseeable future.\nThis is part of Apple\u2019s work to protect Apple Store employees and customers during the coronavirus outbreak, the report says, but there is not an outright ban on try-ons. If a customer specifically requests to try-on AirPods or an Apple Watch, employees can oblige. The key here is that employees are being told not to offer try-ons.\nThe report explains:\nApple is scaling back Apple Watch try-ons at some of its retail stores in an effort to combat the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, according to sources familiar with the matter. Apple Store employees are being instructed not to encourage customers to try on products like the Apple Watch and AirPods, and to only allow customers to do so upon request.\nApple Stores have long offered Apple Watch try-ons, allowing users to try out the different case sizes and band designs. Customers can also try on AirPods Pro to experience the in-ear fit and different sizing options.\nApple retail stores remain open around the world during the coronavirus outbreak, but with new measures to help control crowd sizes as well as deep cleaning protocols and hand sanitizing stations. Apple has closed all of its retail stores in Italy for the indefinite future, it announced this afternoon.\n9to5Mac reported earlier this week that Apple is giving retail and hourly workers unlimited sick leave for coronavirus-like symptoms \u2014 with no doctor\u2019s note required. As we said at the time, the coronavirus situation is evolving at a rapid pace, and it\u2019s always possible Apple ends up closing retail stores or dramatically reducing hours.\nRead more:",

        "title": "Plague Inc. skyrockets to top of Apple's paid iPhone apps as fears of coronavirus spread",
        "body": "A video game about the spread of a deadly plague reached the top of the charts Monday as the world grapples with the spread of coronavirus in the real world. Plague Inc., which was created in 2012 by Ndemic Creations, has seen a spike in purchases since the virus outbreak.\nPlague Inc. is a simulation strategy game that involves the user creating and evolving a pathogen to destroy the human population while countering the efforts of governments to contain it. As of Monday morning, the $0.99-game is the top paid iPhone app, beating out the likes of the hugely popular Minecraft.\nIts surge in popularity comes as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread. So far the disease has killed more than 3,000 people, a vast majority in China.\nChina removed the game from sale in the country's app store last week, Ndemic Creations said.\n\"We have a huge amount of respect for our Chinese players and are devastated that they are no longer able to access and play Plague Inc.,\" the company wrote in blog post Thursday. \"It's not clear to us if this removal is linked to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak that China is facing.\"\nIn January, as the outbreak was first emerging in Wuhan, China, Ndemic Creations wrote: \"Plague Inc. has been out for eight years now and whenever there is an outbreak of disease we see an increase in players, as people seek to find out more about how diseases spread and to understand the complexities of viral outbreaks.\" The company added, \"We specifically designed the game to be realistic and informative, while not sensationalising serious real-world issues.\"\nThe game has been praised by the likes of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for being an educational way to learn how pandemics unfold. The CDC said the game creates a \"compelling world that engages the public on serious public health topics.\"\nFollowing a similar trend, the 2011 movie \"Contagion\" has also gained newfound popularity because of the coronavirus. The film focuses on a global pandemic that starts off in China before spreading into the rest of the world.\nWhile the number of new cases recorded daily in China has declined recently, the virus continues spreading fast in South Korea, Iran and Italy, prompting increased travel warnings and restrictions, and new cases are being reported daily in the U.S.",

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (BLOOMBERG, REUTERS) - Apple Inc has reopened all 42 of its stores in China after it was forced to close them last month due to the coronavirus outbreak in the country.\nThe closures were one of two primary reasons Apple cited for pulling down its revenue forecast for the March quarter. China is Apple's third-biggest market.\nSince shutting the stores, Apple gradually reopened them, and 38 of the 42 stores were operating as of last week. The final four will open their doors on Friday (March 13) local time, according to Apple's website. An Apple spokesman confirmed the move.\nChina placed curbs on travel and asked residents to avoid public places in late January, just ahead of the Chinese New Year festival, a major gift-giving holiday. Those restrictions stayed largely in place through most of February.\nThe company sold fewer than half a million iPhones in China in February, government data showed on Monday, as the outbreak halved demand for smartphones. Apple had announced the shuttering of its branded stores in early February.\nApple was also forced to close all 17 of its stores in Italy earlier this week as the virus spread there.\nMeanwhile, Apple has also started creating more space in its retail stores and cancelling some classes to limit Covid-19 transmission. It also encouraged employees at several of its offices to work remotely this week.",

        "title": "The Apple Watch Doesn\u2019t Need Sleep Tracking Until It Gets Better Battery Life",
        "body": "The Apple Watch is widely considered to be the best smartwatch out there, even though it doesn\u2019t work with Android phones. Personally, I had never used an Apple Watch until a couple weeks ago when I started using our Series 5 unit as my smartwatch of choice with my iPhone.\nAs one would expect, everything works great and in tandem between this watch and my phone, and it\u2019s all great. However, I\u2019ve had many people come up to me asking why the Apple Watch doesn\u2019t come with sleep tracking built in. After all, it is a feature you\u2019d find in almost every smartwatch out there, even on fitness bands. After thinking about that for a bit, and having used the watch for long enough to no longer be constantly amazed by things about it, I think the Apple Watch doesn\u2019t need sleep tracking to be built in until the battery life gets better.\nSo You Thought the Battery Life Was Good Enough?\nYou\u2019re not entirely wrong if that\u2019s the impression you have about the Apple Watch. The Series 5 I\u2019m using (GPS only) easily goes through the day with Always On Display turned on. That\u2019s when my usual day starts from around 7AM to 10PM. In that time, the watch is anywhere between 50 to 60% when I place it back on that magnetic cradle.\nThat\u2019s good. It\u2019s not great, and it\u2019s definitely not enough to be worn through the night because guess what, you need to wear it again the next day, so when exactly would you charge it?\nI won\u2019t blame you if you were thinking you could just charge it the next morning before heading out to work, but the Series 5 just doesn\u2019t charge fast enough.\nBy Apple\u2019s own testing, the Series 5 takes 1.5 hours to charge from 0 to 80%, and a total of 2.5 hours to go from 0 to 100%. Now I don\u2019t know about you, but it usually doesn\u2019t take me 2.5 hours to get ready for work.\nWhat If You Really Need Sleep Tracking?\nSure, there\u2019s an argument to be made about someone needing to keep a track of their sleeping habits, and considering the amount of attention Apple pays to making sure the Apple Watch is a great fitness companion (it really is), it seems like sleep tracking should be somewhere high-up on their to-do list for watchOS.\nWho knows, maybe Apple finally does bring sleep tracking to the Apple Watch with the Series 6 this year. Maybe. I don\u2019t think they should though.\nBefore Apple implements sleep tracking in the Apple Watch, the company needs to figure out one of two things (preferably both, actually):\nThe battery needs to last much longer, or,\nThe watch needs to charge considerably faster than it does.\nSee, if the battery on the Apple Watch lasted, say, 3 days, sleep tracking would be great. You wear your watch continuously for three days, including while you sleep, and then one night you let it charge. Sure you don\u2019t get sleep data for one night, but it\u2019s better than not getting sleep data ever.\nSecond, if the watch charged faster than it does, the current battery situation would resolve itself. You can wear the watch the whole day, sleep with it still on your wrist, and just charge it the next morning while you get ready for work (or play).\nThat\u2019s wishful thinking, and while I certainly hope Apple will figure out some way to get this done, I won\u2019t hold my breath for it, and I will definitely not be happy about the Apple Watch based on my own hopes for what the future holds for this product.\nAs of right now, if you really need sleep tracking on the Apple Watch, there are a bunch of apps you can go with. I would recommend Pillow (Free, with in-app purchases), or AutoSleep ($2.99 | \u20b9249) because these are the only two apps that have a nice design, and also automatically track sleep. You can also check out Sleep++ (download) which is completely free, doesn\u2019t look all that great, but gets the job done.\nApple Needs to Up the Apple Watch\u2019s Battery Life\nEverything said and done, I have to say I really love the Apple Watch, and it\u2019s not just based on the merits of this watch as a device (even though it has a lot of those individual merits), it\u2019s also because I am deep into the Apple ecosystem right now, and the Apple Watch works seamlessly with everything else I use.\nHeck, I\u2019m not even mad about the battery life because I don\u2019t really have a use for sleep tracking. That said, I would love not having to charge my watch every night, because that will be a nightmare on vacations or weekend trips. There are some tips that you can use to improve battery life on Apple Watch Series 6, but they are not enough if you want to get multi-day use out of it.\nLook, I don\u2019t know what Apple is planning to do with the Apple Watch Series 6 when it launches this fall, but I am hoping that if the company decides to add sleep tracking, they will also make major improvements in the battery department.

The report highlights the suspected Geekbench 4 score of the A14 chip, with a frequency reaching 3.1GHz. This would be 400MHz higher than Apple's current A13 Bionic chip with a frequency of 2.7GHz.\nAt such a frequency, the chip's Geekbench 5 running points have surged. The report mentions that the A14's single-core performance shows a score of 1658 (up 25% from the A13), and a multi-core score of 4612 points (up 33% from the A13). The extra processing power will be helpful in running simultaneous workflows, navigating through apps, and more.\nApple chipmaker TSMC is expected to ramp up production of Apple's 5nm-based A14 chipsets in as early as April of this year.\nIn addition to the A14 chip, rumors recently have mentioned both Arm processors with Mac Pro level performance and a Mac with an Apple-designed Arm processor are in the works.",

        "title": "Apple allowing ads in push notifications is a path better left unwalked",
        "body": "Apple has recently updated its developer guidelines, and in particular, we should pay attention to the changes to the rules about notifications. Because they're pretty gross, and it's down a road that I wish Apple wouldn't walk.\nDevelopers will be able to use notifications for promotions or direct marketing thanks to changes to section 4.5.4.\nSection 4.5.4 now reads thusly:\n4.5.4 Push Notifications must not be required for the app to function, and should not be used to send sensitive personal or confidential information. Push Notifications should not be used for promotions or direct marketing purposes unless customers have explicitly opted in to receive them via consent language displayed in your app's UI, and you provide a method in your app for a user to opt out from receiving such messages. Abuse of these services may result in revocation of your privileges.\nLook, this really feels like a gut-check kind of thing, and my gut says allowing advertisement in notifications is gross. It's bad enough that Apple advertises using notifications in its own apps (especially when you're not a subscriber to its services), but to allow it for developers now just makes me uncomfortable.\nWe're overloaded with advertising these days. We don't need more of it, especially for a device that's on us all of the time. It's one thing to encounter a lot of ads on the web on, for instance, your Mac. To have them on a device that you always have with you, buzzing or beeping all of the time, is user-hostile.\nThere are sure to be developers out there who won't use this feature. And there are going to be developers who use it sparingly, or maybe even in inventive ways that enhance your experience. If a favorite game gets a new piece of content or puts something on sale, then sure, I wouldn't mind knowing about it.\nBut you and I both know you're going to see company after company tries to abuse this system. Sales, new content, oh, and did you remember to upgrade to a premium membership? You should really upgrade to a premium membership.\nNow, some might say that I'm overblowing this. After all, the new rules say that you can't send these notifications unless users have explicitly opted in. There needs to be explicit consent language and easy opt-out. Well, excuse me if I don't place my faith in an app review system that regularly gets its wires crossed.\nI'd put real money on bad actors slipping by these provisions. Maybe they'll be caught right away. Maybe they won't. Maybe it'll be a big company, like Facebook, who says, \"No, we're going to do it this way, and if you try and make us change it, we'll leave.\"\nBut also, people often just tap 'Yes' or 'Agreed' or 'Continue' on pop-ups on their phones. They don't read carefully enough. They'll permit these types of notifications, almost accidentally, and the next thing you know, they'll be spammed by the bad actors of the App Store that they've installed on their phone.\nMaybe they should read things more carefully. But the kind of people that will abuse this system know that they won't and they take advantage of that. A lot of people are impatient. It doesn't mean they deserve it when someone takes advantage of them because they didn't read the fine print.\nAnd what's to say that these rules won't be relaxed further somewhere down the road? Slippery slope arguments are a fallacy to be sure. Still, I think we've all be burned badly at least one time before by a company we trusted, so I don't think we can put complete faith in Apple here to hold this particular line, especially when they didn't even hold the previous line for themselves.\nThe world doesn't need additional opportunities to advertise to us. Keep it confined inside of your app. Opening this door is the wrong move by Apple, and I'm not excited to see how some developers will take advantage of it.\nBut what do you think? Do you take this as a bad sign, or are those among us worried about this just overblowing it? Let us know in the comments.",

        "body": "Apple can now help you determine whether you should request a coronavirus test.\nOn Friday, the company released(Opens in a new window) its COVID-19 screening tool, which will ask you questions about any coronavirus-related symptoms you\u2019re feeling, and what to do next.\nApple created the tool in partnership with the CDC, the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and FEMA, to make it easier for people in the US to receive trusted information on illness, which has now infected(Opens in a new window) more than 93,000 people in the country.\nThe test is open to all users, and available at apple.com/covid19(Opens in a new window). You can also download it from the iOS App Store(Opens in a new window). No personal information, such as name or email address, is required. The company also says it won\u2019t share any answers you give to the screening tool to Apple or the CDC, unless you give them permission to do so.\nWhether the tool is actually helpful is another matter. If Apple determines you may have contracted the illness, the screening tool will simply suggest you contact a doctor\u2019s office or local health department about getting a coronavirus test, which is the same guidance(Opens in a new window) from the CDC. Apple\u2019s site will also recommend you isolate yourself to prevent infecting others. Other tips include getting rest and monitoring your symptoms.\nIf Apple's tool suspects you may have the illness.\nThe site won\u2019t fix the current difficulties in obtaining a coronavirus test. Rather, Apple\u2019s focus is to supply information about the illness and how to protect yourself. The same tool includes educational pages on the need to wash your hands and to practice social distancing, in addition to who should get tested and why.\n\u201cAlong with the new COVID-19 app and website, customers across the US may also ask Siri, \u2018How do I know if I have coronavirus?\u2019 to access guidance and resources from the CDC and a curated collection of telehealth apps available on the App Store,\u201d the company said in today\u2019s announcement.\nApple's advice on testing.\nAll the major tech companies have been trying to educate the public on the disease. For example, Microsoft also partnered with the CDC to create a chatbot(Opens in a new window) that can consult users about the coronavirus and whether they should seek out a test. You can also ask Amazon's Alexa about your symptoms.\nGoogle, on the other hand, was ensnared in some controversy after President Trump wrongly claimed the company was working on a website to direct US users to immediate coronavirus testing. The actual site comes from Google\u2019s sister company, Verily, and remains an early stage operation confined to California in four locations. In the meantime, Google created an informational site(Opens in a new window) devoted to preventing COVID-19 infections.\nHow to Keep Your Phone Clean and Safe From Carrying Coronavirus How to Keep Your Phone Clean and Safe From Carrying Coronavirus",

Credit: Bloomberg\nThe Chinese government maintains the camps, which it describes as vocational education facilities, are needed to combat terrorism in the Xinjiang region and to \"ensure its smooth economic transition\".\nIt has dismissed claims that up to a million members of the Uighur muslim minority have been detained in the camps as \"fake news\".",
