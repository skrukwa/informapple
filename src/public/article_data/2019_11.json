        "title": "Apple commits $2.5 billion to combat housing crisis in California",
        "body": "Apple\u2019s commitment to the state of California includes:\n$1 billion affordable housing investment fund: The $1 billion commitment to the state of California is a first-of-its-kind affordable housing fund that will provide the state and others with an open line of credit to develop and build additional new, very low- to moderate-income housing faster and at a lower cost.\n$1 billion first-time homebuyer mortgage assistance fund: Working with the state, this first-time homebuyer fund will provide aspiring homebuyers with financing and down payment assistance. Apple and the state will explore strategies to increase access to first-time homeownership opportunities for essential service personnel, school employees and veterans.\n$300 million Apple-owned land will be available for affordable housing: Apple intends to make available land it owns in San Jose worth approximately $300 million for the development of new affordable housing.\nThe funding commitment to California is expected to take approximately two years to be fully utilized depending on the availability of projects. Capital returned to Apple will be reinvested in future projects over the next five years.\nIn addition to these initiatives, Apple is working to identify private developers who, with the right financing and investment, are ready to start construction on affordable housing projects in the Bay Area immediately.\nApple will also provide $200 million to support new lower-income housing and help some of the most vulnerable populations in the Bay Area:\n$150 million Bay Area housing fund: In a public-private partnership, Apple is launching a new $150 million affordable housing fund with partners including Housing Trust Silicon Valley to support new affordable housing projects. The fund will consist of long-term forgivable loans and grants.\n$50 million to support vulnerable populations: Apple will donate $50 million to support Destination: Home\u2019s efforts to address homelessness in Silicon Valley. Apple will focus its contribution on driving systemic change across the many factors affecting homelessness. Apple will also be identifying similar efforts in Northern and Southern California, focusing on strategies that both end and prevent homelessness.\n\u201cWe\u2019re so grateful that Apple has made this significant philanthropic commitment towards solving Silicon Valley\u2019s growing homelessness crisis,\u201d said Jennifer Loving, Destination: Home\u2019s CEO. \u201cWith this generous contribution, we\u2019ll be able to scale two proven strategies for reducing homelessness in our community: the production of more permanently affordable housing for our most vulnerable residents and an expansion of prevention programs that help at-risk families remain stably housed. Apple\u2019s contribution serves as an example of how Silicon Valley companies can work in partnership with the public and nonprofit sectors to address this huge challenge, and I hope others will follow their lead in the weeks and months ahead.\u201d\nOne of the first projects Apple will fund as part of its philanthropic commitment to Destination: Home will be an expansion of the organization\u2019s Homelessness Prevention System, a network of service providers offering employment assistance, legal aid, rent subsidy, case management and other support to reduce homelessness.\n\u201cWe have worked closely with leading experts to put together a plan that confronts this challenge on all fronts, from the critical need to increase housing supply, to support for first-time homebuyers and young families, to essential philanthropy to assist those at greatest risk,\u201d said Lisa Jackson, Apple\u2019s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. \u201cApple is committed to being a good neighbor and helping to write the next chapter of the region that has been a great home of innovation and creativity for generations.\u201d\nBy putting its $2.5 billion investment to use across multiple initiatives and partners, Apple\u2019s housing initiative offers a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach to address some of the most urgent challenges facing affordable housing in California. This initiative is a major step, and Apple will continue looking for ways to support communities and affordable housing.",

        "body": "YouTube has been pissing me off for weeks. I\u2019m starting to feel like I should pay $11.99 a month to subscribe to YouTube Premium just to get rid of the annoying pop-ups Google sends me almost daily. Google has decided to place pop-up ads in its own YouTube app for Premium subscriptions. This feels slightly acceptable at first, but Google has also decided these should spam you to death, sometimes full-screen, with no option to permanently dismiss them so you see them all the damn time.\nIt\u2019s a classic growth hack designed to get more people to use YouTube Music or YouTube Premium because, honestly, who cares about either of those services? I already subscribe to Spotify, which is far superior to YouTube Music, and I\u2019d never pay $11.99 just to have fewer YouTube ads and background playback of videos on my phone. It\u2019s a pointless subscription that Google is trying to lazily ram down my throat instead of improving its offering, competing fairly with others, and, most importantly, focusing on its customer experience.\nGoogle\u2019s efforts here have made sure I, and I bet many others, will never touch YouTube Music or YouTube Premium. I absolutely loathe both of these services to the point where I\u2019m left swearing at my phone like an idiot, simply because these stubborn ads keep appearing on top of the YouTube videos I\u2019m trying to watch.\nI wish Google was alone in its efforts, but it\u2019s an age-old trick that other giant tech companies that also control major platforms have been experimenting with recently. Apple has decided it\u2019s fine for it to use marketing push notifications for its new Apple TV Plus subscription service and even a full-screen ad on the Apple TV hardware itself.\nMicrosoft also went through a phase of infesting Windows 10 with annoying ads for OneDrive, its Edge browser, and more. Thankfully, Microsoft has relented and changed its ways, and Apple\u2019s own notifications are a one-time-only affair.\nGoogle also does similar tricks to force people into using Chrome, too. There are plenty of notifications in Google search to switch to Chrome if you\u2019re not using Google\u2019s browser, and a lot of Google\u2019s web services barely support rival browsers when they first debut. Microsoft also uses notifications on its webpages to get people to use Edge or Bing, and these often feel persistent rather than occasional one-time messages.\nAll of this behavior is super irritating if you\u2019re a customer of Google, Apple, or Microsoft who enjoys using services from different companies. I use a Windows PC daily, with Google\u2019s web services, and an iPhone 11 Pro for my mobile needs. I want these things to work better together, not to be forced into paying $11.99 a month to make some dumb message disappear when I\u2019m using YouTube.\nIt\u2019s also super anti-competitive. Apple, Google, and Microsoft don\u2019t allow third-party developers to abuse their platforms with these types of pop-ups, so why do these giant tech companies think it\u2019s fine just because they\u2019re in control?",

        "title": "Germany forces Apple to let other mobile wallet services use iPhone's NFC chip",
        "body": "A new German law passed yesterday requires Apple to allow other mobile payments services access to the iPhone\u2019s NFC chip for payments to allow them to fully compete with Apple Pay.\nApple initially completely locked down the NFC chip so that it could be used only by Apple Pay. It later allowed some third-party apps to use the chip but has always refused to do so for other mobile payment apps\u2026\nBanks have been demanding access to the NFC chip for their own payment apps since 2016. Australia\u2019s three biggest banks claimed that locking them out of the NFC chip was anti-competitive behavior.\nNational Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp all want the right to access the NFC chip in iPhones for their own mobile wallet apps.\nReuters reports that the law doesn\u2019t name Apple specifically, but would apply to the tech giant. The piece somewhat confusingly refers to access to the NFC chip by third-party payment apps as Apple Pay.\nA German parliamentary committee unexpectedly voted in a late-night session on Wednesday to force the tech giant to open up Apple Pay to rival providers in Germany. This came in the form of an amendment to an anti-money laundering law that was adopted late on Thursday by the full parliament and is set to come into effect early next year. The legislation, which did not name Apple specifically, will force operators of electronic money infrastructure to offer access to rivals for a reasonable fee.\nApple says that the change would be harmful.\nWe are surprised at how suddenly this legislation was introduced. We fear that the draft law could be harmful to user friendliness, data protection and the security of financial information.\nOther European countries may follow Germany\u2019s example. The EU\u2019s antitrust regular was last month reported to be looking into a number of alleged anti-competitive behaviors and restricting access to the NFC chip is one of them.\nThe investigation covers topics like the prominence of Apple Pay when users set up an iPhone, like the \u201cSet Up Now\u201d notifications that pop up in the Settings app. Another possible issue is the fact that Apple does not let other NFC payment services integrate with the Wallet app, meaning Apple Pay has several exclusive integrations into iOS. A Commission representative said that they were looking at \u201cpossible anti-competitive market practices and abusive conduct.\u201d\nThis means that Apple could be forced to allow users to choose which mobile payment app is automatically opened when an iPhone\u2019s NFC chip comes within range of a contactless payment pad.",

        "title": "People love AirPods so much they spend more than half a billion a year replacing them",
        "body": "Apple will sell between $10 billion and $12 billion worth of AirPods in 2019, according to one Wall Street analyst's estimate.\nReplacement AirPods and their cases will account for 5% to 7% of all AirPod sales this year \u2014 or around $700 million \u2014 according to the same estimate.\nLost AirPods are so common they are turning up in New York City subway tracks.\nMore than 100 AirPods or charging cases were rescued over a one-year period, according to the subway system.\nSure, wireless ear buds are freeing \u2014 but with that freedom comes the propensity to lose them. Case in point: Hundreds of earphones, including Apple's sleek AirPods, have ended up in the New York City subway system's tracks over the past year, landing among the metal rails alongside thousands of other lost objects including cell phones, flip-flops and keys.\nAccording to the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which oversees New York's subways, exactly 104 of the roughly 5,000 pieces of rescued personal property from July 2018 to July 2019 were Apple AirPods or their charging cases.\nThe actual number of salvaged AirPods could be even greater. MTA maintenance teams also logged 672 \"ear bud\" incidents and another 147 \"headphone\" incidents, some of which could have involved AirPods.\n\"AirPod\" references in the MTA logs grew more common in March when Apple released a new version, noted MTA spokesperson Andrei Berman: \"Maybe people in the field grew more familiar with the terminology.\"\nLuckily for Apple, its customers are deeply attached to their detached ear gear and are expected to spend $700 million or more this year just to replace lost AirPods and charging cases in 2019, according to one Wall Street analyst's estimate.\n\"It continues to be almost an epidemic, in terms of AirPod losses,\" said Wedbush securities analyst Dan Ives, who owns two pairs of AirPods.\nHe expects Apple to sell 62 million sets of AirPods this year, generating around $10 billion to $12 billion in sales, depending on how many customers purchase the basic model with two earbuds nestled inside a little plug-in charging case ($159) or a fancier wireless version of the charging case ($199). Replacement ear buds and cases represent about 5% to 7% of total AirPod sales, Ives estimates, or replacement sales of around $700 million, based on the mid-ranges of his numbers.\nVery few users who lose their AirPods \u2014 maybe 1%, Ives figures \u2014 won't replace the lost accessories. \"Many consumers view their priorities as food, water and AirPods,\" Ives said.\nApple does not break out sales for AirPods. Nor would the company disclose how many customers purchase replacements, either in pairs or individually. It's also unclear which pod is more likely to drop \u2014 left versus right.\nAll we know is the company charges $69 for a replacement AirPod or $138 for a pair. Charging cases can also be replaced for $59 for plug-ins and $79 for wireless versions. Apple does not offer an insurance policy for misplaced AirPods, either, a company spokesperson said.\nThe Wall Street Journal this week reported that the MTA is \"weighing\" a public service announcement encouraging riders to stop fiddling with their AirPods while boarding trains \u2014 a statement the transit authority claims was taken out of context.\nAn MTA spokesperson said the transit agency always urges customers to take care of their \"personal electronic devices,\" including AirPods, but has no plans for AirPod-specific announcements.\n\"The bottom line is people drop headphones and phones \u2014 it's a perennial story. When the new iPhone came out, people were dropping that,\" Berman said. \"Drops tend to coincide with product launches.\"\nThe wider social media realm is rife with complaints of AirPods popping out of their owners' ears. A search for \"lost AirPod\" on Twitter turns up a barrage of tweets, including:\n\"Feeling like I can't function because I've lost my left @Apple AirPod,\" a user named Panda Marie tweeted.\n\"U don't know stress until u lost a single airpod,\" reads a tweet from user Captain Ryce.\n\"Looking for a sugar daddy to buy me the left AirPod bc I lost mine on the bus today ;),\" @sammy_beaver101 tweeted.\n\"Last night I had to purchase a right AirPod. It was like my left one lost its soulmate and remarried. I don't wish that on anyone,\" @_MannyFresh87 tweeted.\nIf you're going to lose them, lose them now. The Trump administration's new 15% tariff on Chinese imports that started September 1 includes Bluetooth-enabled earbuds and could soon bump up their price.",

        "body": "Congress has been struggling for years to pass a federal data privacy law, but on Friday, lawmakers gained an unexpected ally in Apple CEO Tim Cook.\nIn an interview with ABC News, the executive said big tech companies haven\u2019t corrected their mistakes, and it\u2019s time for the government to step in \u2014 ideally with a federal privacy bill. \u201cI think we can all admit that when you\u2019ve tried to do something and companies haven\u2019t self policed, that it\u2019s time to have rigorous regulation,\u201d he explained, \u201cand I think we\u2019ve passed that time.\u201d\nBut while many are focused on splitting up companies like Facebook into separate, smaller entities, Cook also said regulators are too focused on antitrust action and not focused enough on data privacy. Breaking up big tech companies without paying attention to how much user data is still being collected is pointless, he said. \u201cUnless you take an action where there\u2019s materially less data in the companies that are left,\u201d Cook told ABC, \u201cyou haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d\nThe news comes as tech giants including Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google face numerous antitrust investigations from the Justice Department as well as many state attorneys general. The companies are being accused of anti-competitive business practices that may have hurt consumers.\nCook admitted that if one of the companies is found to be a monopoly, and regulators can prove they\u2019ve abused that monopoly power, a breakup might be necessary. \u201cThat\u2019s for the courts and regulators to decide, not for me to decide,\u201d he added. \u201cBut in the case where the answer is yes there\u2019s a monopoly, yes have abused, then the remedy for one of those is break up.\u201d\nCook\u2019s comments come days after Apple broke ground on a new campus in Austin, Texas, that\u2019s expected to cost $1 billion. In anticipation of the event, Cook and President Trump toured an electronics factory outside Austin, to highlight US manufacturing.\nThe tour shone a spotlight on Cook\u2019s unusual relationship with President Trump, which has largely escaped public scrutiny. Cook sits on the president\u2019s Workforce Policy Advisory Board and has used this relationship to advocate for favorable policies toward Apple.",

        "body": "Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday sharply criticized an announcement from tech giant Apple that the company would invest $2.5 billion in helping to asssuage the effects of California's housing crisis--a crisis that Apple has contributed to by driving prices up as the company has expanded in the San Francisco area.\n\"Apple's announcement that it is entering the real estate lending business is an effort to distract from the fact that it has helped create California's housing crisis--all while raking in $800 million of taxpayer subsidies, and keeping a quarter trillion dollars of profit offshore, in order to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes,\" Sanders, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, said in a statement.\n\"Bernie Sanders comes out swinging on Apple's housing announcement,\" tweeted ReCode reporter Teddy Schleifer.\n\"Bernie is the first 2020 candidate I've seen to weigh in on this,\" added Schleifer.\nSanders, in his statement, said that relying on company's like Apple to solve the issue is not a solution--no matter how much money the tech giant is throwing at the problem.\n\"Today, more than 134,000 Californians are homeless and renters need to earn $34.69 per hour to afford the average two-bedroom apartment,\" said Sanders. \"We cannot rely on corporate tax evaders to solve California's housing crisis.\"\nAs Common Dreams reported, Sanders unveiled his \"Housing for All\" plan in September, promoting an end to homelessness, national rent control, and the construction of 10 million new homes.\nThe senator referred to the plan on Monday, promising Apple that it would contribute to solving the issue, though perhaps not in the way the company had in mind. The proposal calls for $2.5 trillion in spending over the next decade--which would \"be fully paid for by establishing a tax on the wealthiest top one-tenth of one percent of Americans,\" according to the Sanders campaign.\n\"When we defeat Donald Trump, we are going to make companies like Apple start paying their fair share, so that we can finally start making massive long-term investments that guarantee Americans affordable housing,\" said Sanders.",

Interestingly, Apple has not included either of their bios on the leadership page which leaves the page absent of any design-focused executive representation.\nAlan Dye did previously have a stint on the leadership page. Him and Richard Howarth showed up during the time when Jony Ive was \u2018promoted\u2019 to the role of Chief Design Officer in 2015, which many saw as the beginning of the end for Ive.\nIn a somewhat twisted turn of events, it was announced in late 2017 that Ive would be returning to run to day-to-day responsibilities. Clearly, that did not go well as a year and half later, he would announce his departure.\nIve is leaving Apple to set up his own design consultancy with Marc Newson, called LoveFrom, which will supposedly include Apple as its first client. It remains to be seen whether anything substantial comes out of that partnership. It is hard to imagine how Apple could develop a product alongside an external design group that is not in Cupertino offices day-in day-out. Perhaps LoveFrom will be tasked with making cool Apple Watch bands and little more.\nWith the recent exits of both Jony Ive and Apple VP Communications Steve Dowling, and both having no near-term replacements, the Apple executive page is looking pretty thin. It currently features the following SVPs alongside CEO Tim Cook: Katherine Adams, Eddy Cue, Craig Federighi, John Giannandrea, Sabih Khan, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O\u2019Brien, Dan Riccio, Philip W. Schiller, Johny Srouji, and Jeff Williams.\nApple has over 100 vice president roles, but only a handful get an esteemed place on the company leadership page. The currently-featured VPs are Lisa Jackson, Isabel Ge Mahe, Tor Myhren and Adrian Perica.",

        "body": "Apple has fired an Apple Store employee after they stole a personal photo from the iPhone of a customer.\nThe employee in question worked at the Valley Plaza Mall Apple Store in Bakersfield, CA. Apple has said the employee in question \u201cacted far outside the strict privacy guidelines to which we hold all Apple employees\u201d. They confirmed that the employee is no longer working for Apple.\nBakersfield resident Gloria Fuentes went to the Apple Store on Monday, seeking an iPhone screen repair. She says an Apple employee took her phone to look at it, before returning it. The employee later sent her a text message at home. This contained a single \u201cextremely personal\u201d photo taken from Fuentes\u2019 phone. On Facebook, she noted that this photo was apparently taken \u201calmost a year ago so [the employee would have] had to have scrolled up for a while.\u201d\nAn Apple spokesperson noted that: \u201cApple immediately launched an internal investigation.\u201d They deemed that the employee in question had behaved in a highly inappropriate manner, and made the decision to fire them.\nFuentes has taken the case to the Bakersfield Police Department. It is currently an open, active investigation. That means that possible criminal charges could still follow.\nSource: Facebook\nVia: Bakersfield Now",

        "body": "Swirl Rose \ud81a\uddb9\u037b ,\nHey! I\u2019m 12, I lost my Apple Pencil yesterday and I was looking for everywhere I thought it might be, retracing my steps and trying to remember the last time I saw it and all. I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere, and I was really worried. I decided to have google help me so I searched how to find an Apple Pencil and it said to get a Bluetooth Finder app. I got this one since it has the highest rating of all of them, and when I opened it I couldn\u2019t see the device that said Apple Pencil. Later I found out that\u2019s because I needed to walk around my house and have it detect the devices nearby. I walked into my bedroom and I saw my Apple Pencil there and I was so relieved, but then the signal percentage went down for a few minutes, but then it went back up (I was in the same area this whole time), and then I put my iPad (the device I\u2019m using this app on) in between the space between my bed mattress and bed frame and I got this idea that it was buried in there somewhere. And I found it! In the crack between my mattress and frame! Oh I was so relieved. I found a bunch of other things that mysteriously disappeared awhile back in there too. Two things to take away from this-If something\u2019s lost and it might\u2019ve been in your room, try checking in between the mattress and bed frame and not just your closet or underneath your bed. And second, Wunderfind works wonders! :) I\u2019m so happy I can draw again. Thank you!! <33",

        "title": "Phil Schiller Discusses 16-Inch MacBook Pro, Says Virtual Esc Key Was Number One Complaint About Touch Bar",
        "body": "Apple's marketing chief Phil Schiller has spoken with CNET's Roger Cheng about the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, reflecting on the new Magic Keyboard, the Touch Bar, and many other aspects of the notebook.\nWhen asked about the redesigned scissor keyboard on the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Schiller acknowledged that the butterfly keyboards on recent MacBook Pro models have received a \"mixed reaction\" due in part to \"some quality issues\" that could result in sticky, repeating, or nonfunctional keys.\nSchiller says Apple carefully considered customer feedback and found that many professional users wanted the MacBook Pro to have a similar keyboard as the standalone Magic Keyboard for the iMac:\nAs you know, a number of years ago we started a new keyboard technology with this butterfly keyboard and began it with MacBook. It had some things it did really well, like creating a much more stable key platform. It felt more firm and flat under your finger -- some people really like that, but other people weren't really happy with that. We got sort of a mixed reaction. We had some quality issues we had to work on. Over the years we've been refining that keyboard design, and we're now on the third generation, and a lot of people are much happier with that as we've advanced and advanced it. As we started to investigate specifically what pro users most wanted, a lot of times they would say, \"I want something like this Magic Keyboard, I love that keyboard.\"\nAnother common request among professionals was to bring back a physical Esc key. Schiller said it was the \"number one\" complaint about the Touch Bar. To its credit, Apple listened and made the change:\nThere is a fairly large number of customers who use the Touch Bar and see great benefit in some of its features, but there were also some complaints. If I were to rank the complaints, No. 1 was customers who like a physical Escape key. It was just a hard adaptation for a lot of people. We decided that rather than just remove the Touch Bar and lose the benefits some people get, we could instead add the Escape key. While we were doing that, we had already in the MacBook Air created a discrete Touch ID button. People really like that. So the decision was made to keep the Touch Bar, but also to create room on either side for the Escape key and Touch ID key. That is the best solution for the largest number of people we've dealt with who had complaints -- and kept something innovative that people were using with Touch Bar.\nWhen asked if Apple ever plans to merge the Mac and iPad, Schiller insisted the devices will remain separate:\nNo, that's not our view. Because then you get this in-between thing, and in-between things are never as good as the individual things themselves. We believe the best personal computer is a Mac, and we want to keep going down that path. And we think the best tablet computing device is an iPad, and we'll go down that path.\nSchiller also downplayed the possibility of a touchscreen Mac, as Apple always has.\nAt the very end of the interview, Schiller takes a shot at Google's Chromebooks in the classroom, describing them as \"cheap testing tools\" that do not allow kids to succeed. Naturally, Schiller said Apple thinks the iPad is the \"ultimate tool\" for a child to learn on and be the most engaged.\nChromebooks have gotten to the classroom because, frankly, they're cheap testing tools for required testing. If all you want to do is test kids, well, maybe a cheap notebook will do that. But they're not going to succeed.\nThe full interview contains several more questions and answers and is a worthwhile read.\nUpdate: Schiller also sat down with YouTube tech reviewer Jonathan Morrison to discuss the 16-inch MacBook Pro. Notably, Schiller said that Apple is unlikely to bring an SD card slot back to the MacBook Pro. He also said the technology does not exist yet to bring all of the Pro Display XDR features to a MacBook-sized screen.",

        "body": "Apple plans to release 5.4-inch and 6.7-inch iPhones with thinner OLED displays in 2020, according to Korea's ETNews.\nThe report claims the so-called iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max models will adopt a Samsung technology called Y-OCTA that allows touchscreen circuitry to be directly patterned on the OLED panel without the need for a separate layer, resulting in a thinner display and lower production costs.\nIt's unclear if the thinner display technology would translate to overall thinner iPhones next year. Notably, the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max are actually slightly thicker and heavier than the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, respectively, as Apple added larger batteries in this year's devices.\nSamsung will supply Y-OCTA displays to Apple for both the 5.4-inch and 6.7-inch iPhones, while the lower-cost 6.1-inch model will stick with traditional film-based displays supplied by both Samsung and LG, the report adds. Chinese display maker BOE may be out of the running as a supplier for 2020 iPhones.\n2020 is expected to be a big year for the iPhone, with rumors pointing to the two new display sizes mentioned above, a redesigned metal frame similar to the iPhone 4, rear-facing 3D sensing, 5G support, and up to 6GB of RAM.\nMultiple reports have claimed that Apple eventually plans to release an iPhone with both Face ID and under-screen Touch ID, although it is unclear if the device will arrive in 2020 or 2021. The under-screen Touch ID would potentially allow users to authenticate by holding a finger anywhere on the display.\nApple's plans to release 5.4-inch, 6.1-inch, and 6.7-inch iPhones in 2020 are backed by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and others.",

        "title": "CNET Apple iPhone 11 review: The best $700 iPhone Apple has ever made",
        "body": "Update, Nov. 9, 2020: iPhone 12 is here. Read CNET's reviews of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max.\nThe Good Even faster speed, improved battery life. The iPhone 11's cameras get an excellent new Night Mode and an ultrawide-angle camera that can add extra detail in photos. Fantastic video camera. The Bad Only Pro models get the 2x telephoto. The ultrawide-angle camera doesn\u2019t add Night Mode. No USB-C port. The Pro phones have a faster 18-watt charger but the iPhone 11 doesn't. Still has a good -- but not OLED -- display. The Bottom Line Apple may have skipped flashy extras on this year's phones, but the iPhone 11 is the best midtier model the company's ever made.\nWhen you first hear the names of Apple's new iPhones -- the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max -- you may have some questions. Where's the iPhone X? And what makes the iPhone Pro... Pro? What happened to last year's XS and XS Max? This year's new phones are polished sequels (literally and figuratively) to the three we got last year. For some people the iPhone 11 just needs to be better than the XS. And it indeed is. But for others, it's nice to know where Apple stands in the larger landscape of phones. There are wild 5G speeds on the horizon, plus bizarre and expensive foldable phones like Samsung's Galaxy Fold. And then there's the more expensive $799 (\u00a3669, AU$1,049) Google Pixel 4, which actually makes the $699 (\u00a3729, AU$1,199) iPhone 11 look like an even better value.\nRead more: iPhone SE 2020 review\nApple did a great job with new features, including some serious camera improvements like Night Mode for taking photos in dimly lit situations and Deep Fusion, a new way for the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro to process photos taken in situations where the lighting is bright enough for you to see, but nothing like being outside on a sunny day.\nRead: iPhone 11 vs. iPhone 11 Pro: Important differences to help you decide which one to buy\nBut there's a good reason why the company named its more expensive and fancier phones \"Pro\" this year: Price. Apple is smartly targeting the $699 iPhone 11 as the phone for most people, in the same mold as the iPhone XR last year.\nWhile the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max (left and top) have three 12-megapixel cameras, the iPhone 11 (right) has only two. Sarah Tew/CNET\nEssentially, the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro are 85% the exact same phone. If you want a dedicated telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom, different size options, a better screen and finish, you're going to pay 30% more. That is not to say the $999 iPhone 11 Pro and $1,099 11 Pro Max aren't great phones. It's just that the iPhone 11 is actually that good. And that is why Apple's \"value\" phone with its wonderful cameras, solid build (which survived CNET's drop and water tests) and iOS 13.2 earns the iPhone 11 a CNET Editors' Choice Award.\nEditors' note, March 30: Five months after Apple launched the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, the phones still represent two of the best that you can buy today. In February, the Galaxy S20 launched at a starting price of $999. Technically it's the most affordable phone in Samsung's current generation. Compared to the Galaxy S20, the iPhone 11 is an absolute steal. The original review, published on Sept. 17, follows below.\nStill starts at 64GB\nThe $699 iPhone 11 model gets 64GB of storage, which is probably fine for many people -- and it's a $50 price drop from last year's iPhone XR base model. 128GB for $749 probably makes more sense if you're shooting any video and 256GB for $849 should only be a consideration if you're shooting a lot of video. The Pro phones add a 512GB tier that you won't need unless you're shooting in 4K for a living. See the chart at the bottom of this review for complete pricing details, including UK and Australian prices.\nRead more: Steven Soderbergh might need to upgrade to the iPhone 11 Pro for his next film\nColors: iPhone 11 is the fun phone\nFor whatever reasons, Apple is still making the lower-priced iPhone 11, the one that comes in fun colors. There are two new colors, called green and purple, that are more like mint green and lavender. These new pastel colors replace the blue and coral options from last year.\nI have the green iPhone 11. Its color is pleasant, and the aluminum case color is much closer to seamless with the glass color. The glossy glass back feels the same as last year's XR. So does the rest of the phone -- except for the dual cameras, which are raised up from the back and placed in a frosted glass camera square.\nIn contrast, the iPhone 11 Pro models all have metallic shades: silver, space gray, gold and a military-esque midnight green. The three cameras seem more industrial (maybe imposing). The back glass is matte, instead of glossy. They're made of steel instead of aluminum. And the Pro phones feel significantly denser. They pack larger batteries, and the steel adds weight.\nI like that the iPhone 11 follows in the footsteps of the iPhone XR and is the middle-size phone again with a 6.1-inch screen -- compared with the two iPhone Pro models at 5.8 inches and 6.5 inches. I've come to favor the smaller iPhone 11 Pro, like the iPhone XS last year.\nCameras\nOver the past few years, Apple has made impressive strides in camera quality, but so have many other phone makers like Samsung, Huawei and Google. The camera arms race is something that hard-core photographers study closely, but I'd argue it's gone way past what most people need. The iPhone 11 cameras are some of the best for photos and video capture that you can buy today.\nThe iPhone 11 can switch between a wide angle and ultrawide-angle lens. The iPhone 11 Pro can do the same, but also offers a telephoto camera to get closer to your subject. Sarah Tew/CNET\nThe 11 comes with a new ultrawide-angle camera, Night Mode for low-light photography, Deep Fusion processing for better indoor shots, faster autofocus and overall sharper images with more accurate color reproduction. For a more in-depth look at the camera differences between this year's iPhone and last year's, read our iPhone camera comparison between the iPhone 11 with Deep Fusion and the iPhone XR. The ultrawide offers a radical change in perspective that can be dizzyingly unique visually. This won't become your go-to camera, but it's just a blast to use.\nThis plate of scallops truly takes center stage when photographed with the iPhone 11 ultrawide-angle camera. Patrick Holland/CNET\nNight Mode is a key feature that helps Apple catch up to similar capabilities from Google, Huawei and Samsung. And so far, Apple's version is impressive.\nEnlarge Image A shot of Brooklyn Bridge Park at night, making colors pop. More saturated colors are part of Night Mode's vibe. Scott Stein/CNET\nNight Mode, how it works and when it doesn't\nLike the Google Pixel 4, the Huawei P30 Pro and Samsung's Galaxy Note 10, taking startling low-light photos seems to be in every phone-maker's computational wheelhouse now. Apple's version brightens photos, captures less image noise and does all of this automatically. The way it works is when you open up the default camera app, the phone determines when it's dark enough to go into Night Mode. At this time, there isn't a manual way to trigger the mode.\nNight Mode uses adaptive bracketing and takes a series of photos, some with a longer shutter speed, others with a shorter one. The iPhone then fuses all the photos together to reduce motion blur and brighten shadows. When I took handheld Night Mode shots the sequence would take about 3 to 5 seconds. When I put the iPhone on a tripod I got a 10-second time and was even able to manually override that for a 28-second Night Mode shot.\nI took a photo of a tree in my backyard that was in complete darkness. Below is a shot with the iPhone 11 using Night Mode and another with last year's iPhone XS.\nThe HDR-like feel of the photos keeps some of the night effects, but at other times the photos can end up looking like day. Night Mode can be turned off by tapping the icon and sliding the timer off, but so far it's been an improvement in nearly every instance.\nIt's not a perfect tool: Faces can get blurred, detail can be lost. But still, I've been wowed. The Night Mode effects work the same on the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro, but the Pro also gets a telephoto camera that can use it.\nYou can't use Night Mode in the ultrawide-angle mode, though. That camera ends up looking a lot darker, and it doesn't have optical image stabilization, either. That's true on all this year's models.\nEnlarge Image Frame the shots right, and the ultrawide-angle camera can do fun things. Scott Stein/CNET\nUltrawide angle = drama camera\nThe newest camera has an ultrawide 13mm equivalent lens that is just a plain fun to use. If the main wide camera is like a business suit and the \"tele\" lens is a sporty blazer, then the ultrawide is the equivalent of a Hawaiian shirt. It's obviously different and really changes the way you shoot. It won't be great in every situation, but it can be equal parts handy, like when shooting in smaller spaces, and artistic, adding drama to a mundane scene.\nApple balanced the distortion so there's a little (which you want for that ultrawide look) but it's not horrible. I immediately found angles on my subjects that made them look larger than life. Best of all, you can use the ultrawide lens when shooting video. In fact, during a recording you can switch between cameras. Apple even put a cool zoom effect to transition between lenses.\nWithout a doubt, it can make for stunning shots. Ultrawide cameras are another new trend across phone cameras. Apple promises a few extra benefits here. The iPhone 11 gets an improved ultrawide-angle Portrait mode that can work with close-ups of your pets and other things. All the phones get an expanded-view viewfinder that now previews what's outside the shot, which can help you know when to use the ultrawide lens.\nThe ultrawide camera works for photos and videos. Patrick Holland/CNET\nA funky extra also captures some ultrawide camera data in a Quick Take video, when you press and hold the camera button in the Camera app. It looks to pull in people who might be out of frame. So far, I haven't had this mode work for me yet.\nApple will also be using the multiple cameras for an upcoming Deep Fusion feature coming to all the phones next month. More on that below. It promises to deliver a superphoto taken from multiple shots. It's not quite Smart HDR, but it'll work automatically. I'm reminded of the promises of the Nokia 9, which aimed to blend photos into a superimage, too.\nTake a look at photos from the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max +65 more See all photos\nDeep Fusion, aka 'sweater mode'\nThe iPhone 11's new Deep Fusion processing shines under a medium amount of light. It's best to think of medium light as lighting inside a room with no natural light, or an office where your desk is far away from the windows. The lighting is bright enough for you to see, but nothing like being outside on a sunny day.\nLike Smart HDR, it takes multiple images and merges them together. But unlike Smart HDR, Deep Fusion does an analysis and optimizes things on a pixel level to make details pop, capture less image noise and improve brightness. The differences between an iPhone 11 photo using Deep Fusion and one from the XR without the new process are subtle.\nKeep in mind that Deep Fusion processing isn't the only thing that improves photos from the iPhone 11. There's the improved sharpness and focus from the phone's new main camera. Overall, your photos will just look better without any extra effort from you.\nBelow are photos of a public phone in a BART station. The lighting was dim but didn't trigger the iPhone 11's Night Mode. (Also, holy heck, they still make pay phones!) Notice the text and scratches on the phone in the photo taken with the iPhone 11 compared with the one taken with the XR. The details are so much sharper. You can also see how the iPhone 11's Deep Fusion minimizes image noise in the wall behind the phone. The iPhone XR's photo gets the smear treatment from its noise reduction.\nMore stabilized video, and better overall video\nI already loved the iPhone's video functions. I shot some test footage on the new phones, and was curious about the extra processing stabilization. The iPhone X and XS were already good enough for me to walk around and shoot Apple's event demo room. The iPhone 11 and 11 Pro do it better, but I found the wide camera was a bit smoother than the ultrawide one.\nThe video doesn't use Night Mode, but videos did look better in darker spaces. Still, video in seriously dark places comes out darker than photos (even without Night Mode). We used some video footage in our review video, check it out.\nSlow-mo selfies and the wider selfie cam\nThe wider-angled front-facing camera is welcome. It can digitally zoom in or out to accommodate a wider view that includes more people and background. The 12-megapixel front-facing camera looks better and I was happy with the results, but you have to be artful with the wider camera. Sometimes I ended up looking like a little face in a mountain of shirt.\nWhen the phone is held vertically the selfie camera is zoomed in by default, and it \"zooms out\" when you rotate it to landscape. Scott Stein/CNET\nMy kids instantly started messing around with the slow-motion selfie feature. Yes, that's the slofie. It's not a Live Photo, though. It's just a video mode. That makes it hard to do much with, because the file sizes get large. I do, however, have a lot of extended 120-fps slow-motion scenes of my kids sticking out their tongues.\nSpeed, yes, but really, battery life\nAfter conducting our formal battery tests and living with the iPhone 11 for over a month, we found the battery life is about the same as last year's iPhone XR. In our streaming video tests the iPhone 11 lasted 13 hours and 52 minutes compared with the iPhone XR's time of 12 hours and 7 minutes in the same test. In daily use, the iPhone 11 has been lasting about a day and a half.\nThe A13 processor and RAM are the same on all the new iPhone models (4GB RAM, and a seemingly equally fast processor by benchmarks). It's a bit faster in single tasking, and a bigger leap in multitasking. Graphics performance, in theory, looks great, coming closer to last year's iPad Pro.\nSome other things to note\nThe LCD display is the same as last year, and it's totally fine. Apple's imposing-sounding Super Retina XDR display on the iPhone 11 Pro models is technically higher-res, more vivid and brighter than the iPhone 11's display. But when you compare them side by side, most people (including me) are hard-pressed to find a difference. Apple does a great job with its LCD Liquid Retina display in the iPhone 11. It doesn't feel like a compromise except when looking at dark images with subtle light details. Oh, and the notch is exactly the same as before. I'd rather it weren't, but at least I'm used to it now.\nThe iPhone 11 has an LCD screen and the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max have OLED displays. But you'd be hard-pressed to notice the difference. Sarah Tew/CNET\nNo USB-C?\nI'm annoyed these don't have USB-C charging, or a way to charge the Apple Watch or AirPods from the back the way Samsung's phones let you charge Samsung watches and the Galaxy Buds. The iPhone 11 Pro now comes with a better 18-watt charger that includes a more useful Lightning-to-USB-C cable, at least. But the regular iPhone 11 does not.\nWi-Fi 6: The new Wi-Fi standard is faster, but on my home 100-megabit network I didn't see any changes over the iPhone XS.\nRead more: The iPhone 11 supports Wi-Fi 6: Here's what that means for you\nFaster cellular (but not 5G): Gigabit LTE is on the iPhone 11, which the XR didn't have. The iPhone 11 still has 2x2 MIMO antennas. You get 4x4 MIMO on the iPhone 11 Pro, which can improve signal strength and speed, but we'll see over time what the differences are.\nBetter water resistance? (We'll see)\nThe iPhone 11 is rated for 2 meters of water resistance for 30 minutes. The iPhone 11 Pro is rated for 4 meters, for 30 minutes. In our iPhone 11 and 11 Pro water submersion tests (with the help of an underwater drone) the phones proved they were more than capable of being submerged beyond what they were designed for.\nDrop test: We couldn't crack the iPhone 11\nLast year's iPhone XS lasted surprisingly well in our drop test. The XR, not quite as much. All the \"11 phones\" sport improved glass, per Apple. We ran a drop test on both the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. We dropped each phone from four different heights: 3, 6, 8 and 11 feet. From 8 feet and below both phones survived being dropped onto a concrete floor. The iPhone 11 Pro is the only one that showed damage. A few pixels on the 11 Pro's screen stopped working and there was a minor scuff on the aluminum bumper and a cosmetic scratch on the top lens housing. The camera itself still worked.\nFrom 11 feet, both phones still didn't crack, but the iPhone 11's rear camera stopped working and the iPhone 11 Pro's SIM card tray popped out. It was easily pushed back into play, but a small bulge appeared along the seam of where the screen joins the stainless-steel frame. For more details, check out this story about CNET's drop test of the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro.\nA U1 chip with spatial awareness\nUltrawideband (UWB) is a technology that can offer location features more accurate than Bluetooth . This year's iPhones have a new U1 chip that could come to other devices or even rumored Apple location tags later this year. Apple promises that with the U1 chip, AirDrop will now work more precisely by pointing one iPhone 11 toward another iPhone 11. It could also improve AR by locating beacons in a space. The U1 features aren't coming until Sept. 30 with iOS 13.1, so we'll check back then.\nChoose the even-less-expensive XR?\nThe iPhone XR, the direct ancestor of the iPhone 11, now sells for $100 less, starting at $599. If you're not interested in a wide-angle camera or night photos, I'd say go with that. If you got the XR last year, the iPhone 11 definitely isn't enough of a reason to upgrade.\nWhat does Pro do for you?\nIf you couldn't tell, I think the standard iPhone 11 has everything you'd need for the price, except for that telephoto lens. Whether or not that extra camera lens, an extra boost of battery life, a more vivid OLED display and a stainless-steel body add up to a worthwhile $300 upgrade depends on how much you value those features.\nThe iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max are smaller and larger respectively than the one-size-fits-all iPhone 11. Sarah Tew/CNET\nI lean toward the smaller iPhone 11 Pro as my favorite iPhone this year. But for most people who are in the market for an iPhone upgrade, I'd recommend the iPhone 11. Or just waiting. You're definitely OK with last year's phone, and I'd even stay put if you have an iPhone 8 or iPhone X. Next year's iPhones could be part of a big upgrade cycle that's likely to include 5G. And Google's new Pixel 4 phones are another option.\nThis year's iPhone 11 models are boring upgrades, but they are good ones. And all three are worthy of being called \"Pro.\"",

        "body": "Apple Music is now partnering with businesses to play music at retail stores. In a partnership with PlayNetwork, businesses can sign up to Apple Music for Business plans and get licensed music to be played in their retail locations with Apple providing human-curated playlists and even custom recommendations matched to the individual store brand.\nBusinesses can control the music being played using a special iPhone or iPad app. The Wall Street Journal notes the program has been piloted for a while and is now expanding to larger stores.\nThe consumer licensing terms in mainstream streaming services, like Apple Music or Spotify, do not include provisions for playing music in commercial locations.\nThe different terms (such licenses cost more money per stream) mean that businesses need to make deals with special providers to get legal in-store music. Both Spotify and Apple have started divisions of their music services to address the retail audience.\nThe Journal says that the Harrods department store started using Apple Music for Business a few weeks ago.\nThe deal includes Apple making custom playlists to fit the culture of the store. Harrods will be showing billboards in-store that promote the Apple Music service to customers. Harrods will get an affiliate commission if the signs lead to free trial signups.",

        "title": "Facebook is secretly using your iPhone\u2019s camera as you scroll your feed",
        "body": "iPhone owners, beware. It appears Facebook might be actively using your camera without your knowledge while you\u2019re scrolling your feed.\nThe issue has come to light after a user going by the name Joshua Maddux took to Twitter to report the unusual behavior, which occurs in the Facebook app for iOS. In footage he shared, you can see his camera actively working in the background as he scrolls through his feed.\nThe problem becomes evident due to a bug that shows the camera feed in a tiny sliver on the left side of your screen, when you open a photo in the app and swipe down. TNW has since been able to independently reproduce the issue.\nHere\u2019s what this looks like:\nFound a @facebook #security & #privacy issue. When the app is open it actively uses the camera. I found a bug in the app that lets you see the camera open behind your feed. Note that I had the camera pointed at the carpet. pic.twitter.com/B8b9oE1nbl \u2014 Joshua Maddux (@JoshuaMaddux) November 10, 2019\nMaddux adds he found the same issue on five iPhone devices running iOS 13.2.2, but was unable to reproduce it on iOS 12. \u201cI will note that iPhones running iOS 12 don\u2019t show the camera (not to say that it\u2019s not being used),\u201d he said.\nThe findings are consistent with our own attempts. While iPhones running iOS 13.2.2 indeed show the camera actively working in the background, the issue doesn\u2019t appear to affect iOS 13.1.3. We further noticed the issue only occurs if you have given the Facebook app access to your camera. If not, it appears the Facebook app tries to access it, but iOS blocks the attempt.\nIt remains unclear if this is expected behavior or simply a bug in the software for iOS (we all know what Facebook will say; spoiler: \u201cMuh, duh, guh, it\u2019s a bug. We sorry.\u201d). For what it\u2019s worth, we\u2019ve been unable to reproduce the issue on Android (version 10, used on Google Pixel 4).\nWhatever the reason for it, though, this behavior is particularly concerning \u2014 especially considering Facebook\u2019s atrocious track record when it comes to user privacy (remember Cambrdige Analytica?).\nBy now, everyone should be well aware that any iOS app that has been granted access to your camera can secretly record you. Back in 2017, researcher Felix Krause spoke to TNW about the same issue.\nAt the time, the researcher noted one way to deal with this privacy concern is to revoke camera access (though that arguably doesn\u2019t make for a smooth software experience). Another thing he suggested is covering up your camera \u2014 like former FBI director James Comey and Facebook\u2019s own emperor Mark Zuckerberg do. Learn from the pros I guess.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Facebook for further comment, and will update this piece accordingly if we hear back.\nUpdate November 13, 7:20AM UTC: Facebook has confirmed the issue, calling it a bug (who would\u2019ve guessed, right?).\n\u201cWe recently discovered our iOS app incorrectly launched in landscape. In fixing that last week in v246 we inadvertently introduced a bug where the app partially navigates to the camera screen when a photo is tapped,\u201d Facebook VP of Integrity Guy Rosen tweeted. \u201cWe have no evidence of photos/videos uploaded due to this.\u201d\nSo, at least that.\nIn the meantime, Rosen says Facebook is submitting a fix to the App Store.",

        "title": "IBM: \u2018Mac users are happier and more productive\u2019",
        "body": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2013 IBM stole the show at the annual Jamf Nation User Conference this week when it announced that Mac users are more likely to stay with the company and will be more productive while they're there.\nIBM\u2019s happy Apple orchestra\nIBM CIO Fletcher Previn talked up fresh IBM findings that show those of its employees who use Macs are more likely to stay with IBM and exceed performance expectations compared to PC users.\nThe details of his claims are:\nThere are 22% more macOS users who exceeded expectations in performance reviews, compared to Windows users.\nHigh-value sales deals tend to be 16% larger for macOS users, compared to Windows users.\nmacOS users are 17% less likely to leave IBM, compared to those who use Windows.\nMacOS users are happier with the third-party software availability within IBM \u2014 just 5% of macOS users ask for additional software, compared to 11% of Windows users.\nIt\u2019s possible these claims reflect some other difference between Mac and PC users, but with hundreds of thousands of IBM employees in the sample group it\u2019s hard not to see some contribution from the choice of computing platform.\nTomorrow\u2019s world today\n\u201cThe state of IT is a daily reflection of what IBM thinks and feels about its employees,\u201d said IBM CIO Fletcher Previn. \u201cI\u2019ve said it before \u2013 when did it become OK to live like the Jetsons at home, but the Flintstones at work? We aim to create a productive environment for IBM\u2019ers and continuously improve their work experience, and that\u2019s why we introduced our employee-choice program to IBM employees in 2015.\u201d\nWhen IBM began its widely-reported move to integrate Mac (and other Apple systems) across its business with the Mac@IBM scheme in 2015, the company discovered that tech support costs were much, much lower.\nAt that time, it was deploying 1,900 Mac devices per week. During this deployment, it found that a single help desk person was able to support 5,400 Mac users \u2014 even though it took about 22 people to support the equivalent number of PC users.\nThe TCO argument is over\nToday, IBM has just seven people supporting 200,000 macOS devices in contrast to the 20 needed to support the same number of Windows devices, IBM said at JNUC.\nThis means it costs IBM 186% more to support Windows than it does Macs.\nThis wasn\u2019t the only big surprise. IBM also observed that users found it easier to migrate from a previous version of Windows to a Mac than to upgrade older Windows systems to the latest version of Windows. IBM claims 98% of its Mac users said migration from Windows to macOS was easy, compared to 86% of people shifting from Windows 7 to Windows 10 who felt the same way.\nAdmittedly, the latter is not too damning a statement on its own. But when it is easier to switch to Mac than it is to stick with Windows \u2013 and when such a migration is also cheaper to support and delivers better staff retention and better productivity \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see why any enterprise would delay exploring Apple as a viable alternative to existing technologies, particularly as older Windows versions hit End Of Life.\nWhat happens next?\nYear by year, the Jamf JNUC event provides additional evidence that Apple\u2019s platforms are \u2013 at the very least \u2013 peer players in enterprise IT. IBM\u2019s latest revelations seem to suggest that, at least in some common use cases, Apple \u2013 and the Mac \u2013 are breaking out to become the best available platforms for enterprise technology.\nJamf sits at the breaking edge of the Apple ocean as it floods into the enterprise technology sector. The company continues to seek and resolve the challenges faced by those making large-scale Mac deployments. For example, it announced a new endpoint security system for Macs it calls Jamf Protect at JNUC 2019, which it claims will give enterprise security teams \u201cunprecedented visibility into [their] Mac fleet,\" along with the ability to identify and deal with threats.\nApple in the IT ecosystem\nThis is, in my opinion, a major step toward the evolution of (private by design) edge-device based AI-supplemented protections that I believe will define future cybersecurity protection. Jamf is by no means the only company exploring such systems \u2014 Orange Cyberdefense has its own takes on situational awareness for systems, for example.\nJosh Stein, director of product strategy for Jamf Protect, explained what the system does:\n\u201c[It] monitors for system-wide activity, enabling security teams to take action against Mac-based threats which may otherwise go unnoticed, all while allowing organizations to embrace new OS functionality from day one.\u201d\nThe company also announced Jamf Connect for mobile, an important technology that allows for secure password-less authentication through most modern systems, replacing smart cards and FIDO security keys with iPhones. The idea is that it becomes possible to use the system and your iPhone in order to access a Mac, cloud services or even Windows computers.\nI\u2019m at the JNUC event this week, but it is becoming very difficult to avoid the sense that, at least in terms of making an edge-based business case for its systems, Apple is developing powerful argument to replace Windows as the base system for successful enterprise IT deployments.\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this is that as Apple develops its own models for ultra-private, on-device AI, at what point can server-based enterprise deployments be replaced by more effective \u2014 and yet more private \u2014 edge-based intelligence?\nThis certainly seems to be where the industry is going.\nPlease follow me on Twitter, or join me in the AppleHolic\u2019s bar & grill and Apple Discussions groups on MeWe.",

        "title": "16-inch MacBook Pro debut likely this week as Apple appears to be holding private press briefings",
        "body": "Where is the rumored 16-inch MacBook Pro? Apple hasn\u2019t officially announced the larger entry in the notebook lineup, but there\u2019s growing evidence that we could finally be on the cusp of an unveil as soon as this week.\nThis is the MacBook Pro that\u2019s expected to be the first to replace the failure plagued butterfly switch keyboard with more reliable scissor switch keys. The rumored MacBook Pro update also appears to have slightly slimmer bezels around the sides of the larger display and changes to the Touch Bar layout.\nApple already held its major fall event in September where it debuted the iPhone 11 and Apple Watch Series 5.\nThe company has held a second fall event in previous years with a focus on Mac and iPad hardware, but Apple spent October premiering Apple TV+ shows for entertainment press before the video service launched on November 2.\nWhat appears to be happening instead of a dedicated hardware event from Apple this year is another play the company has been known to use for revealing announcements.\nApple has a dedicated location in New York City where it occasionally holds private briefings with members of the press to give presentations and offer hands-on demonstration time.\nThis week appears to be one of those occasions based both on what 9to5Mac is hearing privately and suggestions by multiple public disclosures. If Apple is holding private press meetings at the start of this week, that suggests we could see the subject of those meetings announced publicly by the middle of the week.\nBut what suggests this could be about the unreleased 16-inch MacBook Pro? That\u2019s an educated guess (and I haven\u2019t personally been holding my breath over previous release rumors).\nApple does have other hardware on the horizon including the publicly announced yet unreleased 2019 Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR, both set for release before the end of the year, and there are rumored hardware tracker tags first discovered by 9to5Mac this summer that could show up any time.\nBut evidence that Apple has been readying a 16-inch MacBook Pro for a while now has only continued to pile up. From supply chain reports from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo to Apple shipping multiple previews of what the machine will look like, the 16-inch MacBook Pro has 2019 written all over it if Apple is prepared to start shipping hardware.\nApple has refreshed or spec-bumped models of the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro and 15-inch MacBook Pro so far this year, although each machine has a keyboard included in Apple\u2019s keyboard service program over reliability issues.\nWe should know how this turns out in a few days so stay tuned. Learn more about what we expect from the rumored 16-inch MacBook Pro here.",

        "body": "A $5B class action lawsuit that accused Apple of selling customer data has been rejected for the second and final time\u2026\nPatently Apple reports that the lawsuit, filed in May, alleged that Apple sold customer-identifying data relating to iTunes purchases.\nThe lawsuit claimed that in order \u201cTo supplement its revenues and enhance the formidability of its brand in the eyes of mobile application developers, Apple sells, rents, transmits, and/or otherwise discloses, to various third parties, information reflecting the music that its customers purchase from the iTunes Store application that comes pre-installed on their iPhones. The data Apple discloses includes the full names and home addresses of its customers, together with the genres and, in some cases, the specific titles of the digitally-recorded music that its customers have purchased via the iTunes Store and then stored in their devices\u2019 Apple Music libraries (collectively \u201cPersonal Listening Information\u201d).\nThe claim was initially rejected last month, though the judge did at that time give the plaintiffs permission to file an amended claim. Legal site MLex reports that they failed to do so, meaning that the case has now been permanently dismissed.\nA month after Apple won a ruling granting its motion to dismiss privacy claims brought under Michigan and Rhode Island law involving the privacy of people\u2019s listening history on iTunes, a federal judge has dismissed the case with prejudice. While US District Judge William Alsup gave plaintiffs Leigh Wheaton, Jill Paul, and Trevor Paul permission to file an amended complaint following his Oct. 25 decision dismissing their claims, they failed to meet a Nov. 14 deadline to file an amended complaint, leading Alsup to issue final judgment in the case.\nAs Patently Apple explains, \u2018with prejudice\u2019 means that no further proceedings are permitted: it has been ruled that Apple has no case to answer.\nThe lawsuit provided no evidence for its claims but argued that evidence would be uncovered during the discovery process. Apple said the claim was completely untrue and successfully argued for it to be dismissed without proceeding to trial.",

        "title": "Opinion: The worst part of Apple TV+ is the TV app",
        "body": "The Apple TV+ debut is a mixed affair. It may only have a handful of shows right now, but people seem to be enjoying them (even if most critics didn\u2019t). I know I am anxiously looking forward to Friday for the next episode of The Morning Show and For All Mankind.\nHowever, Apple TV+ content is only available through the TV app. And the TV app is pretty bad, mediocre at best\u2026\nThe Apple TV set-top box launched in 2015 with the guiding vision that \u2018the future of TV is apps\u2019. Users would download all sorts of video apps from the App Store and switch in and out of its platform.\nHowever, users demanded a more integrated experience. The idea of the TV app, introduced in 2016, was to combine all the TV shows and movies from all of the apps and unify the viewing experience into a single interface, with a combined Up Next queue.\nThe idea was that when browsing for something new to watch, the TV app could automatically show you every provider that offered it and deep link into the video apps you were logged in to. Find Jack Ryan in the TV app? Tap on it to get bounced to the Amazon Prime Video app to watch it, then you can go back to the TV app portal when you are done.\nAt least, that was the proposition.\nSeveral years after the TV app came out, most people didn\u2019t bother with it. The ideals of the experience were hampered by the fact that Apple could not cut enough deals with content apps; Netflix being the biggest holdout.\nFast forward to today. The TV app now has to juggle being a somewhat neutral curation of every TV show and movie available and act as the venue for Apple\u2019s TV+ original content. It has to serve dual duty as directory and provider.\nApple has made very few changes to the TV app design and feature set to accommodate the TV+ launch. TV+ is shoehorned in as just another source of content with very little consideration. With other streaming services, if you want to commit to their world and explore everything they have to offer, you can just open the dedicated app and never touch the TV app. With TV+, that\u2019s simply not possible.\nThere is a channel section of the TV app that is dedicated to TV+ content \u2014 but it\u2019s far from perfect. Finding the TV+ section requires a lot of scrolling, meandering past several screens worth of Watch Now recommendations for everything in the iTunes catalog.\nWhen you get there, it lacks basic hierarchy like filters or subcategories. And most annoyingly, you can\u2019t see the Up Next queue because you aren\u2019t on the main screen anymore.\nI want the TV app to only show me the stuff that I pay for and can actually watch right now. Advertising of the full iTunes store or Apple TV Channels library should be in a separate tab, like a new \u201cBrowse\u201d experience. The primary tabs like \u201cTV Shows\u201d, \u201cMovies\u201d and \u201cKids\u201d should not be thinly-veiled ad platforms.\nIt\u2019s also frustrating that the \u201cLibrary\u201d is not really a library. The Library only includes iTunes content. I want to be able to build a personal library of content regardless of how I paid for it. TV+ shows should be able to be saved to the library to find later, or any Apple TV Channels content for that matter. Obviously, you have to keep subscribing to be able to watch the shows that you didn\u2019t buy outright. The Up Next queue is not enough organization on its own.\nThe tension of the TV app\u2019s purpose is my primary issue. I want to treat TV+ like Netflix and I can\u2019t do that today.\nEven with a library of 9 titles, I just don\u2019t want to need scroll past buy buttons when I\u2019m relaxing in the evening and simply want to watch TV. In six months to a year when the TV+ catalog doubles in size, the need for library management and better organization will become more pressing.\nSecondarily, the TV app is lacking when you actually get to the point of finding a show to watch. There are bugs like watch progress not always saving or autoplay sometimes not suggesting the next episode. I tend not to worry about bugs too much as I know they will get fixed eventually. I get annoyed by the intentional design decisions, and their pitfalls.\nIt\u2019s insane to me that on the iPhone, you can\u2019t get a normal vertical list of episodes for a show. The horizontal card design is very space inefficient and it\u2019s annoying to scroll so much, even on a show with a handful of episodes. You also can\u2019t mark an episode as played or unplayed from the show details; you can only do it from the Up Next queue on the main screen.\nI also think Apple needs to better signpost whether a season is over, and if not when the next episode is coming out. At the end of the episode list for The Morning Show, there should be a placeholder card that says \u2018next episode airs Friday 5th\u2019. Then, I could tap on it and subscribe to be notified for alerts when the episode drops. The notification system for the TV app is very implicit. I want to be able to actively sign up for targeted news to the shows I am invested in. Along the same lines, the show pages should also have jumping-off points to the associated Twitter or Instagram social accounts.\nTruly, feature requests for the TV app is an endless pit. My point here is that a lot of attention has been given to the shows and the stories themselves, but enjoying TV+ is as much as about the app that you have to access it through. Every weakness of the TV app is a bullet point against the TV+ experience.\nIt is true that a lot of TV+\u2019s downsides can be papered over by the fact that most people are paying nothing for a year. However, soon enough, Apple is going to be billing you $4.99 a month. Then, they have no excuses.",

        "body": "During Apple's earnings call for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019 this week, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he believed that the Apple Card had the \"most successful launch of a credit card in the United states ever,\" and that Apple was \"thrilled\" with its reception.\nMore information on how the \u200cApple Card\u200c launch went was shared in Goldman Sachs regulatory filings this week, with key details highlighted by Bloomberg.\nFrom the launch of the card in August to September 30, Goldman Sachs extended credit lines totaling approximately $10 billion to Apple customers. There's no word, though, on how many iPhone users have signed up for an \u200cApple Card\u200c.\nCustomers who did get an \u200cApple Card\u200c had $736 million in loan balances at the end of September, though it's not clear how that compares to other credit cards as Bloomberg says banks do not break out performance by individual cards.\nGoldman Sachs has historically worked with corporations and major investors, but is aiming to reach a mainstream market through \u200cApple Card\u200c. With the launch of \u200cApple Card\u200c, Goldman has cut down on unsecured personal loans through its Marcus brand, intentionally slowing that growth while to focus on the Apple-branded offering.\nDue to this, nearly all of Goldman's growth came from credit card loans over the course of the last quarter.\nApple has been steadily adding new benefits to \u200cApple Card\u200c since its launch to continue to draw new users. \u200cApple Card\u200c now offers three percent cash back when using the card for purchases from Uber, Uber Eats, T-Mobile, Walgreens, and Duane Reade, with plans to expand the three percent cash back offering to additional merchants in the future.\nAt other stores, Apple offers two percent cash back when making an Apple Pay purchase or one percent cash back when making a non-Apple Pay purchase with the physical card or online.\nMost recently, Apple announced an upcoming option that will let \u200cApple Card\u200c customers purchase a new \u200ciPhone\u200c and then pay it over 24 months with no interest. It's the same setup as Apple's current device payment plans, but more conveniently integrated into the \u200cApple Card\u200c for \u200cApple Card\u200c users.",

        "title": "I released my first app this week that adds more than 50 new actions to Shortcuts - MacStories reviewed it! \ud83c\udf89",
        "body": "When I covered the updated Shortcuts app in my iOS and iPadOS 13 review earlier this year, I argued how, thanks to parameters, Shortcuts actions provided by third-party apps could become native features of the Shortcuts app.\nWith his debut app Toolbox Pro, released today on the App Store, developer Alex Hay has taken this idea to its logical conclusion: Toolbox Pro is a new kind of \u201cheadless\u201d app \u2013 a utility whose sole purpose is to complement and extend Apple\u2019s Shortcuts app with over 50 new actions, providing a native implementation of functionalities that Apple hasn\u2019t brought to Shortcuts yet. After having used Toolbox Pro for the past couple of months, not only is the app a clever idea well suited for Shortcuts\u2019 parameter framework, but it\u2019s also a must-have for anyone who relies on Shortcuts on a daily basis.\nHere\u2019s how I described parameters in September:\nParameters are the Shortcuts API I\u2019ve long argued Apple needed to move past URL schemes: they are variables that can pass dynamic input to an app through a shortcut; the app can perform the selected action in the background (without launching), and, unlike in iOS 12, pass back results to the Shortcuts app or Siri. With parameters, app shortcuts are no longer fixed actions: they can be customized by the user to perform different commands, allowing for greater flexibility than iOS 12\u2019s Siri shortcuts and a more secure model than Shortcuts\u2019 old x-callback-URL actions.\nWith parameters, third-party apps can bring their functionalities and content into Shortcuts; they can be integrated with Shortcuts\u2019 default actions and, even better, they can be connected to actions from other third-party apps via the editor as well. We\u2019ve seen some terrific examples of this technology over the past few months: from Drafts\u2019 text and workspace actions and Streaks\u2019 deep integration with parameters to Reeder\u2019s recent embrace of shortcuts to save and retrieve articles, Apple has allowed developers to run free with their shortcut implementations. As someone who, among other topics, covers Shortcuts for a living, it\u2019s been an exciting season in terms of developer adoption and new potential use cases for the app.\nIn most apps, Shortcuts actions are seen as a nice plus to the core in-app experience \u2013 another type of extension that, akin to widgets and share sheet actions, lets an app better integrate with the rest of the system. Toolbox Pro is different: the app itself is merely a container of actions, which you can use in the Shortcuts app as part of your custom shortcuts. You\u2019ll only open the Toolbox Pro app itself to read documentation for each action, download examples created by developer Alex Hay, and tweak a few settings. For the most part, you\u2019ll be taking advantage of Toolbox Pro\u2019s unique features as actions in the Shortcuts app, thereby yielding a different kind of experience with the app \u2013 accessed not via its icon on the Home screen, but exclusively through actions in Shortcuts.\nAs I\u2019ll showcase via multiple examples in this story, what makes Toolbox Pro special isn\u2019t just its inclusion of more esoteric advanced features that extend Shortcuts for automation veterans \u2013 it\u2019s the fact that in addition to those power user tools, the app also provides intuitive, user-friendly actions for system features that Apple itself has yet to integrate with Shortcuts.\nToolbox Pro has deeper Reminders integration than Apple\u2019s own Reminders actions; the app offers actions to scan documents with iOS\u2019 native document scanner and perform OCR on them using Apple\u2019s Natural Language framework; there are actions to play haptic feedback, process images with Core ML tools, and even authenticate with Touch or Face ID. Toolbox Pro\u2019s approach is a smart move: as Apple seems primarily focused on fixing bugs in the Shortcuts app at this point in the iOS 13 cycle, a third-party app can provide native actions for features users have been anticipating, but which the company hasn\u2019t implemented yet.\nAs always with my Shortcuts-related stories, I prefer to let actual examples speak for themselves. Below, you\u2019ll find 10 examples of Toolbox Pro-based shortcuts you can download for free and find in the MacStories Shortcuts Archive, each accompanied by an explanation of the actions behind it. Additionally, I will be releasing 7 advanced shortcuts exclusively for Club MacStories members in Issue 200 of MacStories Weekly later this week. I\u2019ve had a lot of fun learning Toolbox Pro and building shortcuts for it over the past few months, and many of them have become part of my iPhone and iPad Home screens. Let\u2019s dive in.\nThe Toolbox Pro App\nAt a high level, Toolbox Pro\u2019s actions behave in two different ways when executed from the Shortcuts app: most of them run inline within the shortcut editor and pass results to the following actions; due to memory constraints of iOS and iPadOS, others have to launch Toolbox Pro to briefly perform additional processing before reopening Shortcuts automatically. In both cases, you never see any URL schemes and all actions can be configured with parameters inside the Shortcuts app.\nExamples of Toolbox Pro actions in Shortcuts.\nThe difference between actions that run in Shortcuts and those that launch Toolbox Pro are explained in the Toolbox Pro app, which acts as a compendium of sorts to understand the purpose of each action with richer documentation than the short descriptions provided in the Shortcuts app. In the main Tools page, you\u2019ll find a list of every action offered by Toolbox Pro; you can search for an action by name, or you can tap on one to open the full description, which shows helpful labels that indicate whether an action is available for free, runs in Shortcuts or Toolbox Pro, and requires an Internet connection. Toolbox Pro is free to download; to use its premium actions, you\u2019ll have to unlock a one-time $5.99 In-App Purchase.\nBrowsing actions in Toolbox Pro.\nThe description pages in Toolbox Pro do a reasonably good job explaining the functionality of an action, the input it accepts, and the data it provides as output to other actions. I\u2019ve often found myself opening the Toolbox Pro app just to read the documentation and gain more clarity on a specific action\u2019s goal and expected results. For actions that require leaving Shortcuts to perform additional processing in Toolbox Pro, the app always explains that output data will be written to the system clipboard, which means you\u2019ll have to use \u2018Wait for Return\u2019 and \u2018Get Clipboard\u2019 steps in your shortcuts.\nThe best aspect of the Toolbox Pro app is its extensive gallery of example shortcuts you can download to start taking advantage of the app\u2019s actions. Relevant shortcuts are embedded in each action\u2019s description, but you can also open a dedicated Examples page to find all shortcuts created by developer Alex Hay, organized by category.\nExamples shortcuts created by the Toolbox Pro developer.\nHay has assembled a nice collection of shortcuts that cover a variety of use cases for Toolbox Pro: while some of them are, effectively, tutorials in the form of downloadable shortcuts that serve to teach you how to use certain actions (such as checking for your device\u2019s motion or designing rich menus), others are bona fide advanced shortcuts that come bundled with the app for free. You\u2019ll find shortcuts to create new packing lists in Reminders, share a song with links to multiple streaming services, write to and read from NFC tags, and lots more. As part of Apple\u2019s stricter security settings in iOS 13, all shortcuts must be installed via iCloud.com links, which will open directly in the Shortcuts app and allow you to see all actions contained in a shortcut.\nThe Toolbox Pro app is also where you\u2019ll be able to see and manage global variables that can be used by Toolbox Pro actions. Global variables are one of the many examples of features that have long been requested by Shortcuts users, and which have been implemented by Alex Hay in Toolbox Pro. In the Shortcuts app, variables are temporary: their value lasts as long as a shortcut is running; if you want to persist data between shortcuts and store, say, some text or a URL to reuse across different shortcuts at different points in time, your best chance is to rely on iCloud Drive documents as a workaround.\nGlobal variables are encrypted locally, sync with iCloud, and can be managed from the Toolbox Pro app.\nToolbox Pro\u2019s global variables provide an elegant solution to this problem: they can hold any kind of text data in any format, they\u2019re encrypted locally using the system\u2019s keychain, and they\u2019re securely synced across devices via your iCloud account. You can create, update, and delete global variables using dedicated actions in the Shortcuts app, but you can also preview and modify them from a standalone page in Toolbox Pro.\nWhile Toolbox Pro\u2019s global variables (and related management tools) aren\u2019t as advanced as what will be possible in Simon St\u00f8vring\u2019s upcoming Data Jar utility (which I\u2019ve also been testing), they provide a faster, more intuitive, safer solution to storing data than iCloud Drive documents, and I\u2019ve been using them to great effect in some of my more advanced shortcuts.\nToolbox Pro\u2019s Utilities\nBesides global variables, there are several other quality-of-life enhancements provided by Toolbox Pro as Shortcuts actions. These are exactly the types of functions you\u2019d expect Apple to build into the Shortcuts app as pre-installed actions; instead, they were created by a third-party developer and integrated natively with Shortcuts thanks to parameters in iOS 13.\nFor a full list of the tools and functions baked into Toolbox Pro, I recommend checking out this page on the app\u2019s website. There are some highlights I want to point out here though.\nToolbox Pro comes with some remarkable actions to deal with text and lists. With the \u2018Trim Text\u2019 and \u2018Quick Match Text\u2019 actions, developer Alex Hay has abstracted the complexity of regular expressions and built visual actions that let you remove characters at the beginning or end of some text, find text before or after a particular string, or even isolate text located between two strings. Without Toolbox Pro, you\u2019d have to write regex to replicate these functions; with Toolbox Pro\u2019s actions, you just have to tap a few parameters and insert variables where needed.\nComplex regex operations are represented visually with Toolbox Pro\u2019s actions.\nIf you\u2019re dealing with a list of items in the Shortcuts app and want to remove duplicates from it, your best bet is to iterate over each item in the list and add it to a variable if the variable doesn\u2019t already contain it. It\u2019s an easy-enough routine function, but it\u2019s always a chore to put together. Toolbox Pro\u2019s elegant solution to the problem? A single \u2018Remove Duplicates\u2019 action that can find duplicate items in any variable and pass back a de-duplicated list.\nRemoving duplicates is a single action with Toolbox Pro.\nBut there\u2019s more: you can sort lists, reverse their order, and even filter lists by choosing which items to keep or discard based, once again, on parameters you configure visually. These are common concepts that every Shortcuts user has encountered at some point in their experience with the app. Instead of cleverly working around the absence of these native functions in Shortcuts, Toolbox Pro gives you visual, self-contained actions that achieve the same goal, waste less code, and are more readable thanks to parameters and Shortcuts\u2019 new natural language editor.\nWe can finally sort lists thanks to Toolbox Pro.\nPerhaps one of Toolbox Pro\u2019s most fascinating integrations is its inclusion of machine learning-based actions that use Apple\u2019s Core ML and other frameworks to process content passed by Shortcuts. The \u2018Recognize Objects in Image\u2019 action, for instance, uses the MobileNet Core ML classifier to analyze the contents of an image offline, on-device, in a couple seconds. By passing a photo to this action, which runs entirely inside Shortcuts, you\u2019ll be able to get a list of the objects recognized in an image along with the classifier\u2019s confidence level. As with other custom data types returned by Toolbox Pro, you can tap on the \u2018Recognized Object\u2019 variable to access different properties for recognized objects.\nGood job, algorithm. Also, this machine learning classifier runs entirely inside Shortcuts.\nAlso running inside Shortcuts and based on the Vision framework, the \u2018Detect Faces\u2019 action tells you whether a photo contains a face or not. You can even configure the action to pass a thumbnail image showing boundaries around the detected face:\nWell, I guess Casey and I don\u2019t matter to the face detection algorithm.\nIn iOS 13, Apple introduced new Vision APIs for image saliency to generate heat maps and identify the parts of an image most likely to draw attention. With no programming required, Toolbox Pro comes with a single action that lets you obtain such heat maps for areas of attention as well as objects recognized by the machine learning framework in any photo:\nObjects detected by image salience analysis through a Toolbox Pro action.\nToolbox Pro\u2019s machine learning tools go beyond image analysis: you can also extract text from images using Vision\u2019s built-in OCR framework through the \u2018Get Text From Images\u2019 action. Due to memory constraints, this is one of the actions that has to launch Toolbox Pro and switch back to Shortcuts once processing is completed a couple seconds later. You can choose between two options: you can set the action to use a faster, but less accurate OCR algorithm when scanning an image for text, or you can use machine learning to correct for possible language errors in the parsed text. Again, \u201cuse machine learning\u201d is reduced to a single On/Off switch with Toolbox Pro, which can be configured inside Shortcuts.\nPerforming OCR on images with Shortcuts and Toolbox Pro.\nBeyond machine learning-powered actions and tools to handle text and lists of objects, Toolbox Pro offers several nice, smaller integrations that can make your custom shortcuts smarter and shorter. On compatible iPhone models, you can use a \u2018Haptic Feedback\u2019 action that plays a tap of your choosing, such as \u201cerror\u201d or \u201csuccess\u201d; you can check whether dark mode is enabled or audio is currently playing; you can authenticate via Face ID or Touch ID to confirm that you are, indeed, running a shortcut; you can create images (called \u201csolid mattes\u201d), design rich menus with SF Symbols as glyphs, crop images manually (restoring a functionality Apple removed from Shortcuts), get details on the device you\u2019re using, and lots more. Again, for a complete overview of all the actions available in Toolbox Pro, I recommend checking out the full list on the developer\u2019s website here.\nMy Toolbox Pro Shortcuts\nAs you probably know since I started covering Workflow five years ago, the best way to understand new Shortcuts features is to take a look at actual shortcuts and see how they work. For this review, I\u2019ve prepared 10 Toolbox Pro-based shortcuts that you can find below and download for free from the MacStories Shortcuts Archive, which now offers more than 200 shortcuts.\nThe shortcuts I\u2019ve created for MacStories cover four major areas of interest for Toolbox Pro (Camera & OCR; the Preview tool; Text Analysis; Reminders integration) and combine built-in, Apple-made Shortcuts actions with enhancements provided by Toolbox Pro to unlock functionalities that wouldn\u2019t be possible with Shortcuts alone.\nAt the end of this section, you\u2019ll also find a preview of 7 exclusive shortcuts that will be released for Club MacStories members later this week.\nCamera and OCR\nToolbox Pro sports extensive integration with the text recognition features of Apple\u2019s Vision framework. Specifically, the app can perform OCR on images to retrieve text (with two degrees of speed/accuracy) as well as use the system\u2019s document scanner to scan documents.\nThe first shortcut I put together, called Document OCR, lets you perform OCR on an existing document or image by sending a file to Toolbox Pro. After picking an option from a menu, you just need to wait a couple seconds for OCR to finish and recognized text will be passed back to Shortcuts. At the end, you can decide whether you want to use the recognized text or run OCR again.\nHere\u2019s the Document OCR shortcut in action:\nIn my experience, Apple\u2019s OCR (recently seen in apps like Prizmo Go and GoodNotes) has been fast and good enough for documents where text was clearly legible against a light background. I\u2019ve been using this shortcut on a regular basis to extract text from images.\nThere are some implementation details about this shortcut I\u2019d like to highlight. Much like all the other Toolbox Pro shortcuts I\u2019ve created so far, this shortcut uses rich menus to pick from a list of multiple options. Unlike \u201ctraditional\u201d lists, these menus feature a colored glyph next to the action\u2019s label, plus a subtitle \u2013 and they can also contain additional data in other hidden fields. Toolbox Pro lets you design these menus with the Create Menu Item action, which comes with its own icon generator that lets you choose from a set of default icons and colors, load an image from a file or URL, or \u2013 and this is quite impressive \u2013 use any SF Symbols glyph as the icon.\nThe action to create rich menu items in Shortcuts.\nA rich menu created with Toolbox Pro in Shortcuts.\nBesides their pleasing aesthetic and the freedom granted by SF Symbols, what\u2019s great about these menus is that they\u2019re not a new idea (bear with me): developer Alex Hay has taken an existing advanced Shortcuts technique (some would call it a workaround) and built an intuitive UI around it.\nA rich menu created with Toolbox Pro. Under the hood, Shortcuts believes each of these items is a contact.\nUnder the hood, these menus are interpreted by Shortcuts as contact cards: unlike with other types of lists, when you choose from a list of contacts in Shortcuts, you can see profile pictures and additional fields for each option. Creating rich menus without Toolbox Pro is less than ideal given that you need to deal with the raw VCF syntax to create fake contact cards; with Toolbox Pro, you can design menus visually by picking any color or glyph you want and embedding variables within the menu item thanks to parameters.\nApple should provide a native solution for building rich menus that doesn\u2019t involve creating contact cards for non-contact items; until that happens though, Toolbox Pro\u2019s actions to create menu items and retrieve details about them are a good abstraction of the workaround, and I use them a lot.\nDocument OCR Perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on a document. You can import a document from Files or a scanned image from Photos. Recognized text is copied to the clipboard and can be shared with app extensions. Toolbox Pro is required for this shortcut. Get the shortcut here.\nI\u2019ve also been taking advantage of Toolbox Pro\u2019s text recognition actions in a couple other ways. I have a US Apple ID, so I frequently use iTunes gift cards to replenish funds in my account. The website where I buy these gift cards often sends them as scanned copies of physical cards, which means I have to manually transcribe the redemption code and open the App Store to redeem it. That\u2019s no way to live.\nWith my Scan iTunes Gift Card shortcut, you\u2019ll be able to take a picture of an iTunes gift card (or import it from the clipboard if you\u2019ve already copied it) and crop it so that only the redemption code is shown. The shortcut will do the rest: it\u2019ll run text recognition to turn the code\u2019s image into actual text, confirm with you that the scanned code looks right, and open the App Store\u2019s Redeem page with the code already filled-in.\nDon\u2019t worry, I already redeemed this one.\nThis shortcut is a nice example of combining native Shortcuts actions with Toolbox Pro-specific enhancements: the initial menu is a rich one designed with Toolbox Pro, but the Camera action is a native Shortcuts functionality; the manual crop tool (which used to be available in Workflow and was removed in the transition to Shortcuts last year) is another Toolbox Pro action, which needs to open the app and pause Shortcuts until you\u2019ve manually cropped an image. As someone who buys iTunes gift cards on a weekly basis, I appreciate the tiny bit of friction this shortcut has removed from the purchase experience thanks to Toolbox Pro\u2019s actions.\nScan iTunes Gift Card Scan an iTunes gift card, extract its text, and open the App Store to redeem the associated promo code. You can import an image of a gift card from the clipboard or take a new picture. Toolbox Pro is required for this shortcut. Get the shortcut here.\nLastly, the document scanner. First introduced as a Notes feature, the document scanner has been opened up to all developers as part of the Vision framework in iOS 13. Toolbox Pro integrates with the document scanner via the Scan Document action, which will open Toolbox Pro in scanner mode \u2013 the same scanner seen in Files and Notes \u2013 and pass back a scanned image to Shortcuts. In the Scan Document action, parameters let you choose whether you want to return a scanned .PNG image or recognized text (via OCR) back to Shortcuts.\nThe document scanner in Toolbox Pro, activated via Shortcuts.\nThe shortcut I\u2019ve built around this feature, called Scan Document, launches Toolbox Pro\u2019s scanner and returns to Shortcuts once I\u2019ve successfully scanned an image. At that point, a rich menu lets me pick between sharing the scanned image or performing additional OCR on it so I can share the recognized text instead.\nScanning documents with Shortcuts and Apple\u2019s native OCR via Toolbox Pro. Apple\u2019s OCR feature isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s free, fast, and good enough.\nThis is a simple flow of actions, but it speeds up the process of scanning documents considerably. I\u2019ve added the shortcut to my Home screen using the \u201cdocument scanner\u201d icon Silvia designed for MacStories Shortcuts Icons; now, whenever I need to scan a document and share it, I can launch the shortcut directly from the Home screen (without having to hunt down the scanner feature in Files or Notes) and share the resulting file or text with any app I want. The document scanner should also become a native Shortcuts action in the future, but, in the meantime, this will do.\nScan Document Scan a document using iOS\u2019 native document scanner. The shortcut lets you choose whether you want to share the scanned file as an image or run OCR on it to extract text. Toolbox Pro is required for this shortcut. Get the shortcut here.\nCustom Previews\nThe easiest way to describe Toolbox Pro\u2019s Preview tool is the following: imagine if Apple\u2019s Quick Look action could preview multiple variables of different types, such as images and text, at the same time, on the same page, with a native, responsive design that required no coding whatsoever. That\u2019s the gist of the Preview action, a flexible tool that lets you preview the output of a shortcut as a single page in Toolbox Pro.\nThere are two aspects that make the Preview action unique and different from, say, creating your own HTML output. First, it is powered entirely by SwiftUI (much like the rest of Toolbox Pro itself). All kinds of elements are displayed as native code: different levels of text headlines are based on San Francisco\u2019s text styles; image files are rendered natively (no upload to a web service necessary); you can display URLs as rich links, embed interactive maps (powered by MapKit), and even design native buttons. And because under the hood it\u2019s all SwiftUI, you don\u2019t need to think about supporting light/dark modes or scaling the design for larger or smaller screens \u2013 it all happens by default; you just need to put together the content and feed it to the Preview action in Shortcuts.\nPut together variables in Shortcuts, then pass everything to Toolbox Pro to create a rich preview.\nSecond, the Preview tool comes with basic styling options that provide a layer of abstraction on top of SwiftUI. The syntax is heavily influenced by Markdown: you have multiple levels of headlines indicated by the \u2018#\u2019 sign, bullets for lists, horizontal dividers, subheadlines, and captions. Even native elements like rich links and embedded maps require no coding but are instead inserted in the preview using short codes based on simple markup. The syntax is documented in the Toolbox Pro app, and it\u2019s very easy to get started.\nUnder the hood, this is all based on SwiftUI \u2013 but you never see any code.\nI struggled to understand what purpose the Preview tool could serve at first as compared to simply previewing content in Shortcuts; with time, I\u2019ve put together some examples that should give you an idea of what\u2019s possible and a framework to create your own rich previews.\nTo demonstrate the ability of styling text and embedding buttons with Toolbox Pro\u2019s Preview action, I rewrote my Tech News shortcut: the alternate version, called Custom RSS Reader, presents a list of websites as a rich menu (note how I used specific SF Symbols and colors for each one) and gets the latest 10 articles for the selected publication via RSS. Using a combination of Text actions and variables, the shortcut assembles the content to be previewed in Toolbox Pro with elements such as the article\u2019s title, published date and author name, and excerpt. Under the hood, the custom syntax looks like this:\nThe syntax for custom previews looks like Markdown.\nAnd here\u2019s the shortcut in action along with the custom preview:\nAs you can see, the shortcut only takes a few seconds to assemble the content for the preview, which is put together using \u2018Add to Variable\u2019 actions that append text data to a single \u2018Article Preview\u2019 variable. Thanks to the preview\u2019s abstraction of SwiftUI, I didn\u2019t have to write a single line of code to style text, make the page responsive, or support dark mode \u2013 an approach that falls squarely in line with Shortcuts\u2019 modern automation ethos.\nCustom RSS Reader Preview headlines and excerpts from your favorite blogs in a custom preview powered by RSS feeds. Toolbox Pro is required for this shortcut. Get the shortcut here.\nA few weeks ago, I shared a shortcut to browse photos taken with different lenses on iPhone 11 Pro. With Toolbox Pro, I was able to update the iPhone 11 Lens Browser shortcut so it uses a richer preview page instead of a plain list. Toolbox Pro\u2019s Preview action is ideal for this kind of content: the page has a custom title (which changes depending on the lens you\u2019ve selected) and shows full-resolution photos along with details for the iPhone model and lens used to capture a photo. By inspecting each photo\u2019s location metadata, I was even able to turn GPS coordinates into small, zoomable Maps embeds that show you where each photo was taken.\nIn custom previews, you can even long-press photos to reveal a context menu.\nAnd here\u2019s the updated shortcut in action:\niPhone 11 Lens Browser (Extended) Filter your photo library by the lens used to capture a photo. The shortcut is optimized for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro, and it supports the wide, telephoto, and ultra-wide lenses. By default, the shortcut looks at the last 50 photos from your library and opens a custom preview showing metadata for each photo. Toolbox Pro is required for this shortcut. Get the shortcut here.\nAlong the same lines, I\u2019ve created a shortcut that lets you inspect the metadata for any photo passed to the share sheet from Photos. Called Preview Photo Metadata, the shortcut takes any image shared from the Photos app, extracts metadata for it, and displays the result in a custom preview inside Toolbox Pro. It\u2019s a nice way to double-check information about specific images, especially since Apple\u2019s Photos app only displays a subset of metadata.\nPreviewing photo metadata with Shortcuts and Toolbox Pro.\nPreview Photo Metadata Preview photos shared from Photos\u2019 share sheet in a custom preview page. The preview contains the photo, its timestamp, plus metadata including an interactive map. Toolbox Pro is required for this shortcut. Get the shortcut here.\nAs I\u2019ll further demonstrate in other (Club-exclusive) examples below, Toolbox Pro\u2019s custom Preview tool is one of the app\u2019s most exciting features, with a lot of potential for interesting and unexpected use cases.\nThe idea of being able to take any collection of variables, for all kinds of data formats, and translate them to native SwiftUI code without actually writing a single line of it is a remarkably clever one. I can already see how Alex Hay may continue extending previews in the future: users should be able to assemble more complex layouts using table views; there should be more choice in terms of buttons and labels; semantic colors and SF Symbols should also be represented with the ability to add colored elements and glyphs throughout the body of a preview.\nRight now, all of these existing SwiftUI elements are missing from Toolbox Pro\u2019s Preview action, and its performance could be improved (it struggles a bit when previewing, say, 50 photos at once), but it\u2019s a solid start, and it\u2019s a great idea. If you ever wished you could go beyond Shortcuts\u2019 basic Quick Look previews, don\u2019t miss out on Toolbox Pro\u2019s Preview action.\nText Analysis\nI\u2019ve created a single shortcut that takes advantage of Toolbox Pro\u2019s Natural Language-based text analysis actions. I consider it a proof of concept at this stage given that it takes longer to run than I\u2019d like, but it\u2019s a fascinating example of blending the Natural Language framework with Shortcuts and I wanted to share it regardless.\nToolbox Pro bundles an action called \u2018Get Detail From Text\u2019 which relies on smart data detectors and Natural Language to analyze a text string and extract different elements from it. For example, you can pass some text to this action and retrieve the names of people or places contained inside it; you can get the dominant language or sentiment of the overall text; or you can get the names of organizations/topics mentioned in the text. The latter option gave me an idea.\nOver the past few weeks, developer Silvio Rizzi has been quietly updating Reeder, the popular RSS client, with fantastic Shortcuts actions to save articles to Reeder\u2019s Read Later account as well as retrieve details from saved articles. I switched to Reeder as my RSS reader a while back, and I\u2019m in the process of moving from Safari Reading List to Reeder\u2019s Read Later feature, so I thought it\u2019d be fun to combine Reeder\u2019s new actions with Toolbox Pro\u2019s text analysis.\nHere\u2019s what I did: I created a shortcut that lets me choose from a list of companies and topics (such as \u201cApple\u201d or \u201cPlayStation\u201d) and finds articles matching the selected topic in Reeder\u2019s read-later queue. To perform this analysis (which takes a few seconds to run), Shortcuts uses Reeder\u2019s actions to get the full HTML content of each article, converts it to plain text, feeds it to Toolbox Pro\u2019s action, and checks whether the article contains the selected topic. The shortcut presents a list of matching articles at the end and you can choose one to reopen it.\nArticles saved in Reeder (left) are analyzed by Apple\u2019s Natural Language framework using a Toolbox Pro action in Shortcuts.\nI don\u2019t expect to use this shortcut frequently, but it showcases the flexibility of Reeder\u2019s new actions and, more importantly, the potential of blending iOS\u2019 intelligence with Shortcuts in new and interesting ways. I plan on exploring this concept further over the next few months.\nArticles by Topic Filter articles saved in Reeder\u2019s Read Later account by topic. The shortcut relies on iOS\u2019 Natural Language Processing framework to extract organization names from text. You can modify the list of topics to include the ones you prefer. Toolbox Pro and Reeder are required for this shortcut. Get the shortcut here.\nReminders\nI went all-in on Apple\u2019s Reminders app following its excellent update in iOS and iPadOS 13, but one thing I don\u2019t like about the refreshed app is its Shortcuts integration. As I noted in my review, Reminders\u2019 Shortcuts actions are the same as they\u2019ve been for several years at this point: not only do they lack compatibility with major new features introduced this year (such as the URL field, image attachments, and subtasks), but they also fail to support basic operations such as modifying existing reminders, retrieving and creating Reminders lists, or marking individual reminders as complete.\nToolbox Pro features deeper integration with Reminders than Shortcuts to accomplish all the tasks mentioned above with actions that run in the background, without leaving the Shortcuts app. The ability to retrieve all my Reminders lists and modify individual reminders has allowed me to create powerful Reminders-based shortcuts that wouldn\u2019t have been possible with Apple\u2019s app alone, further increasing my usage of Reminders as my primary task manager.\nFirst, I updated my existing New Reminder+ shortcut with an \u201cextended\u201d mode that brings up a rich list of all lists currently configured in the Reminders app. This list was created using Toolbox Pro\u2019s Create Menu Item action and Get Reminder Lists actions; each list is represented with its actual color and a default SF Symbols glyph. Unfortunately, due to iOS limitations, Toolbox Pro cannot fetch the real glyph associated with a list in Reminders, but I can live without it.\nThis version of New Reminder+ achieves the same goal as the original (you can create multiple reminders in a row with natural language dates), but it\u2019s got proper support for all Reminders lists, which is a nicer experience.\nNew Reminder+ (Extended) A custom menu to create new tasks in the Reminders app. You can keep running the shortcut to add multiple reminders in a row. Toolbox Pro is required for this shortcut. Get the shortcut here.\nOnce I figured out how to build a rich menu for my Reminders lists, I took the idea one step further and built a shortcut to do something I\u2019ve long wanted to do with Shortcuts: batch rescheduling multiple reminders to a later date.\nThe first version I created, called Today ReScheduler, fetches reminders due today (including overdue ones) and presents them in a list. In a nice touch made possible by Toolbox Pro, each reminder\u2019s icon features the color of the list it belongs to. After picking one or multiple reminders, the shortcut displays a list of date presets to postpone the selected items with options such as \u201c+1 day\u201d or \u201c+7 days\u201d; if you want, there\u2019s also a manual option that will let you type the exact date and time until which you\u2019d like to defer your reminders. Once you\u2019ve picked a date and time, the shortcut will modify each reminder in the Reminders database (without leaving Shortcuts) and update their due dates. At the end of the shortcut, you\u2019ll see an alert with a summary of the reminders that have been updated and their due date changes.\nRescheduling reminders with Shortcuts.\nI love using this shortcut because I\u2019m bad at meeting my own due dates for reminders but also don\u2019t like seeing several overdue items in Reminders\u2019 Today page. With Today ReScheduler, I can quickly postpone multiple tasks at once in just a few seconds \u2013 it couldn\u2019t be easier:\nToday ReScheduler Reschedule reminders due today (or overdue) to a later date. You can pick multiple reminders at once and change their due date by choosing from some presets or typing a date manually. Toolbox Pro is required for this shortcut. Get the shortcut here.\nI also created an extended version of this shortcut, simply called ReScheduler, which lets you pick reminders from any Reminders lists (not just the ones due today) and reschedule them with a few taps. If you\u2019ve ever found yourself having to push back all reminders belonging to a specific project by a couple of weeks, this shortcut\u2019s for you:\nReScheduler Reschedule any reminder to a later date. You can pick multiple reminders at once and change their due date by choosing from some presets or typing a date manually. Toolbox Pro is required for this shortcut. Get the shortcut here.\nMy ReScheduler shortcut.\nAs I\u2019ll show in the next section, I\u2019ve built more Reminders-based shortcuts for Club MacStories members by taking advantage of Toolbox Pro\u2019s superior integration with Apple\u2019s task manager. Toolbox Pro\u2019s Reminders actions provide a blueprint for Apple to follow in future Shortcuts releases: the ability to fetch Reminders lists and edit existing reminders should be built into Shortcuts without requiring a third-party app. But as I\u2019ve argued for most actions covered in this review, until it happens, Toolbox Pro has this aspect taken care of.\nClub MacStories Shortcuts\nIn addition to the shortcuts published in this article, I\u2019ve created 7 additional advanced shortcuts that will be released exclusively for Club MacStories members later this week in Issue 200 of MacStories Weekly. I\u2019ll share the details for each shortcut in the newsletter, but I\u2019ve prepared previews to show you what they can do.\nApple removed the wish list feature from the App Store a few years ago, and especially since Apple Arcade launched, I\u2019ve found myself missing an easy way to keep track of apps and games I want to download on my devices. Built using Toolbox Pro\u2019s global variables and rich previews, my AppTracker shortcut lets you maintain your own database of App Store apps you want to check out in the future. You can add apps with a companion shortcut called Add to AppTracker, which runs inside the App Store app but can also be used with manual search inside Shortcuts; in the custom preview, you can see the title, icon, category, and price for each app along with buttons to remove the selected app or view it on the App Store.\nI\u2019ve also created a similar shortcut called GameTracker that lets you keep track of videogames you\u2019re currently playing or that perhaps you want to buy. GameTracker uses Toolbox Pro\u2019s native integration with the IGDB service database accessed via the Find Games action to search for videogames for any platform, from PlayStation and Xbox to Nintendo Switch, PC, and even iOS. I\u2019ve created a companion utility that lets you search for games and pick them from a menu, and there\u2019s of course a custom preview that shows all tracked games along with their covers and supported platforms. Game data is stored as a global variable in iCloud by Toolbox Pro, so you can access the preview on all your devices regardless of where you originally added a game from. Given the sheer amount of great videogames that are coming out (Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3! Death Stranding! Pok\u00e9mon!), I plan on using this database quite a lot over the upcoming months.\nGames I\u2019m currently playing, as collected by my GameTracker shortcut.\nIn keeping with the theme of deeper Reminders integration, I\u2019ve expanded on the idea of batch processing of multiple tasks and created ReLister, a shortcut that lets you move multiple reminders at once from one Reminders list to another. You just need to pick starting and destination lists and selected reminders will be moved accordingly, without altering other properties such as due dates or notes.\nHow about simply giving up on your deadlines and removing due dates from multiple reminders at once altogether? With ReCleaner, you\u2019ll be able to pick multiple reminders and scrub the due date property off of them; they\u2019ll stay in the original list, but they\u2019ll no longer have a due date attached. Problem \u201csolved\u201d.\nRemoving due dates from multiple reminders at once.\nFinally, my favorite of the bunch: with my Agenda Preview shortcut, you\u2019ll be able to generate a personalized page with an overview of all scheduled reminders and calendar events for the upcoming week.\nMy Agenda Preview shortcut.\nReminders and events are grouped under each day, and the shortcut can differentiate between upcoming reminders and overdue ones; in the Today section at the top, you\u2019ll also get weather conditions and forecasts for the current day, plus a button to launch the Reminders app directly.\nAs I noted above, all of these shortcuts, along with details on how they were put together, will be released for Club MacStories members in Issue 200 of the MacStories Weekly newsletter later this week.\nWrap-Up\nThere\u2019s no way around it: if you\u2019re a frequent Shortcuts user, Toolbox Pro should be an instant purchase. Its collection of actions perfectly complements Shortcuts and expands upon the app by providing effective solutions to Apple\u2019s limitations. With a roster of over 50 actions at launch and the inclusion of features such as global variables and custom previews, Toolbox Pro is a must-have for anyone who relies on Shortcuts and wants to build even more powerful, flexible automations.\nBut there\u2019s more to Toolbox Pro than its list of actions and integrations. Toolbox Pro is a new kind of app \u2013 a companion utility designed specifically for Shortcuts, built around the same principle: even the most complex actions can be reduced to a single visual, user-friendly step to empower as many users as possible. And whether intentionally or not, Alex Hay\u2019s app begets bigger themes worth considering for the future of Shortcuts.\nAfter playing around with Toolbox Pro, I have to wonder if Apple will ever add new power user-oriented features to Shortcuts now that the app has a wider appeal and is pre-installed on millions of devices. I posed the same question in the conclusion of the Shortcuts chapter of my iOS 13 review: Shortcuts received a fantastic update this year, but Apple didn\u2019t address longstanding limitations of the editor for advanced users, nor did they ship actions designed for those who seek more programmer-y controls over the flow and execution of their shortcuts. It\u2019s fine if Apple believes that third-party apps such as Toolbox Pro can swoop in and provide missing actions for heavy users, but there\u2019s only so much developers can create with the current action and parameter APIs. Should Apple open up the Shortcuts editor to external plugins, much like is possible with some text editors? I doubt they will, but it\u2019s an interesting thought.\nWe\u2019re observing the rise of a tooling ecosystem built around Shortcuts.\nWhich brings me to my second takeaway: with apps like Toolbox Pro, Quickness, and the upcoming Data Jar, we\u2019re observing the rise of a tooling ecosystem built around Shortcuts by third-party developers thanks to parameters in iOS 13. This was part of Apple\u2019s goals with the parameter framework all along, but it\u2019s intriguing to see the technology come to fruition with these meta-utilities that leverage parameters to add missing functionalities back into Shortcuts.\nLastly, Toolbox Pro convinced me that we should keep an eye on the potential of blending Core ML and Vision with Shortcuts actions in the future. The idea of actions that analyze content to produce results you expect without having to actually program them or interact with them could yield a radical new way of creating personalized shortcuts. Toolbox Pro\u2019s Vision and Core ML actions give us a first glimpse of this concept, and I\u2019m going to keep an eye on this in the future.\nWith Toolbox Pro, developer Alex Hay realized the untapped potential of parameters as a means to extend Shortcuts itself. Toolbox Pro is a must-have utility for all Shortcuts power users, a sign of bigger things to come in this space, and one of the best app debuts of 2019.",

        "title": "13-Inch MacBook Pro With Scissor Keyboard Expected in First Half of 2020.",
        "body": "Following the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple plans to release a new 13-inch MacBook Pro with a scissor switch keyboard in the first half of 2020, according to industry sources cited by hit-or-miss Taiwanese publication DigiTimes. A preview of the report was shared with paying subscribers.\n16-inch MacBook Pro's new scissor switch keyboard via iFixit\nThe report claims the display size will remain 13.3 inches, although given the source is DigiTimes, we would not completely rule out hopes of a larger 14-inch display. Wistron and Global Lighting Technologies are said to be among the suppliers of the keyboards for the smaller notebook.\nThe new 16-inch MacBook Pro features a redesigned scissor switch keyboard, largely based on the standalone Magic Keyboard for the iMac. Given the tried-and-tested design, the keyboard should prove far more reliable than the troublesome butterfly keyboards used across the MacBook lineup in recent years.\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro also features a physical Esc key and an inverted-T arrow key layout. It is unclear if the 13-inch MacBook Pro will follow suit.\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously predicted that Apple will transition its entire notebook lineup to scissor switch keyboards in 2020, including all MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models.\nIt would be hardly surprising if Apple completely moves past its butterfly keyboards, which have suffered from issues with sticky, repeating, or nonfunctional keys since their inception in 2016. Apple continues to offer free repairs to affected customers as part of its worldwide service program.\nThe entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro was last updated in July, while higher-end 13-inch models were refreshed in May.",

        "title": "Apple could bundle news, TV, and music into one subscription as soon as 2020",
        "body": "As smartphone sales plateau, Apple is increasingly looking to subscription services like Apple News+ and Apple TV+ to fuel growth. It\u2019s long been rumored that the company might bundle its various paid services together to boost subscriber figures, and a new report from Bloomberg says this could happen as early as next year.\nThis isn\u2019t unexpected. Bloomberg cites \u201cpeople familiar with the matter\u201d for its prediction, and notes that Apple\u2019s latest deals with publishers for News+ include a provision allowing future bundles. Reports from October said Apple also approached music labels to sound them out on similar Apple Music bundles, though talks are reportedly at an \u201cearly stage.\u201d\nApple now has four primary multimedia subscriptions: Apple News+, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Arcade. And its biggest concern with these services certainly seems to be growth, not profit. It\u2019s introduced a number of initiatives to tempt users to try these subscriptions, including offering a year of free Apple TV+ with new device purchases and bundling TV+ with Apple Music for students.\nAmazon Prime has showed that tech bundles can be very, very successful\nPackaging these services together makes sense for Apple, especially considering the success Amazon has had with its own \u201csuper bundle,\u201d Amazon Prime. It locks customers into Apple\u2019s device ecosystem, creates a regular income stream, and offers plenty of opportunities for growth, such as with new subscription tiers that offer different levels of benefits.\nAn Apple bundle might start with news, TV, and music, but Apple could also chuck in iCloud data and maybe even a credit card deal supported by the Apple Card. Hell, given the existence of the iPhone Upgrade Program, which charges customers a monthly fee to upgrade their phone every year, a future Apple super-bundle-plus might even include hardware on tap.\nApple CEO Tim Cook was actually asked about this possibility on a recent earnings call and didn\u2019t rule it out. He said: \u201cThere are customers today that essentially view the hardware like [a subscription] because they are on upgrade plans and so forth. And so to some degree, that exists today. My perspective is that we will grow in the future to larger numbers that will grow disproportionately.\u201d",
