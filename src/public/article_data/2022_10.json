        "title": "Lufthansa \"bans AirTags in luggage\" after passengers publicly shame it with location of lost bags",
        "body": "Apple's AirTags are an excellent way to know where your luggage is\u2014and a snitch on airlines who don't know where your luggage is. Lufthansa is the first to ban them after \"an awful summer of lost bags\", reports Ben Schlappig. The carrier cites the industry's undead policies against electronic devices on flights.\nLufthansa argues that baggage trackers fall in the category of portable electronic devices, and are therefore subject to dangerous goods regulations issued by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This is specifically because of the transmission function. Lufthansa claims that the transmission function needs to be turned off during flight when in checked luggage, just as is required for cell phones, laptops, etc. My first thought is that I'm not surprised to see Lufthansa be the first airline to add a ban like this. Lufthansa isn't exactly a customer-friendly airline, and the airline has had an awful summer when it comes to lost bags (I even had a delayed Lufthansa bag experience). AirTags empower travelers in terms of knowing exactly where their bags are, and I imagine that's something some airlines don't actually like. If you look at Twitter, you'll see a ton of people expressing frustration with Lufthansa because they know exactly where their checked bag is, while the airline refuses to help.\nEmbedded below is the real problem, for airlines: passengers publicly exposing the stock deceptions and delaying tactics used on the ground by staff, and gathering hard data on baggage handling failures.\nSee more @lufthansa just travelled ATH-MUC-CDG Business Class with 2h30 transit. Somehow you've lost my bag in between?! Apparently your team can't find it (your system is down I'm told)! @Apple AirTag says it's in Toulouse!! Can I please get my bag back before you send it somewhere else? pic.twitter.com/QxwFooJDRl \u2014 KeepOnDiscovering (@mallo75004) August 30, 2021\nUpdate: Confirmation from Lufthansa.",

        "title": "EU Passes Law to Switch iPhone to USB-C in 2024",
        "body": "The European Parliament today voted overwhelmingly in favor of enforcing USB-C as a common charging port across a wide range of consumer electronic devices, including the iPhone and AirPods, by the end of 2024.\nThe proposal, known as a directive, forces all consumer electronics manufacturers who sell their products in Europe to ensure that a wide range of devices feature a USB-C port. This \"common port\" will be a world-first statute and impact Apple in particular since it widely uses the Lightning connector instead of USB-C on many of its devices. MEPs claim that the move will reduce electronic waste, address product sustainability, and make use of different devices more convenient.\nThe directive received 602 votes in favor, 13 votes against, and eight abstentions. A press release issued by the European Parliament earlier today states:\nBy the end of 2024, all mobile phones, tablets and cameras sold in the EU will have to be equipped with a USB Type-C charging port. From spring 2026, the obligation will extend to laptops. The new law, adopted by plenary on Tuesday with 602 votes in favour, 13 against and 8 abstentions, is part of a broader EU effort to reduce e-waste and to empower consumers to make more sustainable choices. Under the new rules, consumers will no longer need a different charger every time they purchase a new device, as they will be able to use one single charger for a whole range of small and medium-sized portable electronic devices. Regardless of their manufacturer, all new mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, headphones and headsets, handheld videogame consoles and portable speakers, e-readers, keyboards, mice, portable navigation systems, earbuds and laptops that are rechargeable via a wired cable, operating with a power delivery of up to 100 Watts, will have to be equipped with a USB Type-C port. All devices that support fast charging will now have the same charging speed, allowing users to charge their devices at the same speed with any compatible charger.\nExemptions will apply for devices that are too small to offer a USB-C port, such as smart watches, health trackers, and some sports equipment, but the legislation is expected to be expanded to other devices over time. Companies will also have to ensure that dedicated labels clearly inform consumers about the charging characteristics of devices they buy.\nIn addition, the EU seeks to ensure that wireless charging solutions are interoperable as the technology evolves over time. The directive empowers the European Commission to develop delegated acts by the end of 2024 that force companies to make their custom wireless charging solutions more open and meet interoperability standards, helping consumers to avoid getting locked into proprietary charging solutions while preventing fragmentation and reducing waste. It is not clear if this would include Apple's MagSafe charging system for the \u200ciPhone\u200c and AirPods since it is based on the Qi wireless charging standard.\nNow, the European Council must approve the directive so that it can be published in the EU Official Journal. It will come into force 20 days after publication in the EU Official Journal and its requirements will start to apply to new devices after 24 months. Products that went on sale before the date of application will be exempt and can continue to be sold after that point.\nIn 2018, the European Commission attempted to reach a final resolution on this issue but it failed to come into law. At the time, Apple warned that forcing a common charging port on the industry would stifle innovation and create electronic waste as consumers would be forced to switch to new cables.\nThe EU's effort resumed last year, with the European Commission spearheading a refreshed version of the directive. In April, the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee voted to support the directive, with 43 votes in favor and just two against. In June, the EU's Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection reached an agreement to introduce the directive to the European Parliament.\nBoth Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman have said that Apple is testing a version of the \u200ciPhone\u200c that has a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. Kuo believes that Apple could switch the \u200ciPhone\u200c to USB-C starting with 2023's iPhone 15, before transitioning AirPods and other accessories at a later date. This timing would allow Apple to switch many of its affected devices to USB-C ahead of the EU directive coming into force.",

        "title": "Apple Music pulls Kanye West \u2018Essentials\u2019 playlists, first streaming service to take action",
        "body": "Kanye West continues to face repercussions for his antisemitic and anti-Black rhetoric, this time by Apple Music. After being dropped by companies like Adidas and Balenciaga, Rolling Stone reports today that Apple has removed its curated \u201cKanye West Essentials\u201d playlist from Apple Music. West\u2019s full discography, however, remains available via the streaming service.\nThis move makes Apple Music the first streaming platform to take action against West following his many hateful and offensive comments. The removal includes the \u201cKanye West Essentials\u201d playlist, as well as the \u201cKanye West Video Essentials\u201d playlist. Both appear to have been removed at some point this week and no longer surface in Apple Music search results.\nApple has stopped short of pulling West\u2019s entire discography, despite mounting pressure to do so. In an interview with Reuters this week, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek indicated that Spotify has no plans to do that. While acknowledging that West has made \u201cjust awful comments,\u201d it\u2019s ultimately up to his label to decide \u201cif they want to take action or not.\u201d\nRolling Stone points out, however, that it\u2019s not necessarily that clearcut in West\u2019s case:\nBut the situation of the West\u2019s label is complicated on his own, considering the fact that he is technically no longer signed to one. After spending most of his career with Def Jam Recordings, West completed his contract with the release of Donda last year. Regardless, the ties between the two haven\u2019t been completely severed, given that Def Jam remains responsible for maintaining his catalog, which features 10 studio albums and a number of collaborative releases.\nDef Jam could easily step in and pull West\u2019s discography from Apple Music, Spotify, and other streaming platforms. Thus far, however, it hasn\u2019t shown any intentions of doing that.\nIn addition to losing his deals with companies like Adidas, Vogue, and Balenciaga, West was also temporarily locked out of his Twitter and Instagram accounts. He was allowed back on Instagram yesterday, while his Twitter account came back online today following Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition of the service.\nApple has not yet commented on its action around Kanye West\u2019s music on Apple Music. The two sides have worked closely in the past, including a live stream of West finishing his Donda album in 2021. A report recently indicated that West had also planned on naming his 2018 album Ye after Adolf Hitler.\ni would love to talk to apple employees who were at the Georgetown Apple Store for this in 2018 pic.twitter.com/cjRkyCYcju \u2014 Chance Miller (@ChanceHMiller) October 27, 2022",

        "title": "Apple Rejected Spotify's App Update Adding Audiobook Support",
        "body": "Apple and Spotify are once again feuding as Spotify attempts to break into the audiobook market, reports The New York Times. Apple has reportedly rejected Spotify's latest app update three times in the last month.\nOver the years, Apple and Spotify have had a long running dispute over Apple's App Store policies, with multiple public conflicts over app and subscription fees and app rejections due to Spotify's attempts to skirt the up to 30 percent cut that Apple takes from purchases.\nApple says that Spotify is again trying to get around its \u200cApp Store\u200c rules, and the Cupertino company claims that Spotify's audiobooks update is not in line with guidelines that cover how apps can communicate with users about purchasing options outside of the \u200cApp Store\u200c.\nApple last year agreed to an App Store rule change that allows developers to use communications like email to share information methods about payment options that are available outside of an iOS app, but Spotify is running into issues attempting to implement this feature. With the rule change, Spotify wanted to direct customers to buy books online to listen to in the app, rather than giving Apple a cut of its audiobook sales.\nApple apparently told Spotify that it can send customers emails about online purchases, but Spotify is not able to offer a button inside of the app to request emails. The feature was designed with Spotify's legal team involved, and Apple initially approved the update in September, but later reversed course, rejecting subsequent updates.\nSpotify designed a nine-step process for purchasing an audiobook, which involved a customer tapping on an audiobook and seeing a screen with a lock over the play button. Pressing on the play button provided customers with a page where they could request information on how to buy a book through an email, and the email offered up a link to purchase the book.\nAn Apple spokesperson told MacRumors that Apple \"has no issues\" with reader apps like Spotify adding audiobook content, but Spotify did not follow Apple's guidelines around in-app communications directing users outside the app.\nThe App Store was designed to be a great business opportunity for developers, and we fully support initiatives to introduce new features in apps that provide lasting value for users. We have no issue with reader apps adding audiobook content to their apps, linking users out to websites to sign up for services, or communicating with customers externally about alternative purchase options. The Spotify app was rejected for not following the guidelines regarding including explicit in-app communications to direct users outside the app to make digital purchases. We provided them with clear guidance on how to resolve the issue, and approved their app after they made changes that brought it into compliance.\nAfter the multiple rejections from Apple, Spotify released a version of the app that removes information about how to purchase an audiobook from the Spotify website, which Apple did approve. Spotify now informs users that there is no option to buy an audiobook in the app. \"We know it's not ideal,\" says Spotify in the app text.\nSpotify in 2019 filed a regulatory complaint with the European Union over Apple's \u200cApp Store\u200c practices, and it maintains an anti-Apple \"Time to Play Fair\" website. Spotify has continued to meet with European regulators, but the case has not concluded as of yet. Spotify has also sided with Epic Games in the Epic Games v. Apple legal battle, and it participates in the \"Coalition for App Fairness\" alongside \u200cEpic Games\u200c, Tile, and others who are unhappy with Apple's \"anti-competitive\" policies.",

        "title": "There are too many iPads, iPhones, and Apple Watches",
        "body": "Last week, I decided I was going to buy a new iPad.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the sixth-gen iPad I currently have, except it\u2019s heavier than I\u2019d like. All I want to do is watch my silly dramas in bed and for it to hurt less when I whack myself in the forehead while drifting off to sleep. It\u2019d be nice to have a faster tablet for odd tasks where my iPhone screen is too small and my laptop is too large \u2014 especially on vacation. Besides, four years is a respectable amount of time to wait when all you want is a slightly faster (and perhaps more colorful) version of what you already got.\nI moseyed on over to the Apple website. There was the ninth-gen iPad and the 10th-gen iPad. There was also the iPad Mini and the iPad Air. I\u2019m not a Pro, but there were two of those \u2014 an 11-inch and a 12.9-inch model. I\u2019m a gadget reviewer. I know several other gadget reviewers, and I knew what I wanted out of a new iPad. You\u2019d think I\u2019d have been able to suss this out. But no.\nAs my colleague Monica Chin aptly put it, the new iPad doesn\u2019t make sense. At $449, it\u2019s too expensive to be entry level \u2014 especially when, as my editor Dan Seifert points out in his review, the Air can easily be found on sale. Plus, I\u2019m not buying a silly USB-C to Lightning Pencil adapter just to try digitizing my analog calligraphy hobby. And if I were really that concerned about price, there was no way to justify an iPad Pro. Okay, whatever. I wanted a faster, lighter, and much more colorful iPad. That left the Air or Mini. I\u2019m in my purple era right now \u2014 purple iPhone, purple Beats Fit Pro, purple backpack, purple water bottle, and purple keyboard. A purple Air or Mini would work. Except they\u2019re both more expensive than the 10th-gen iPad, and price was a big reason I was looking at the colorful entry-level iPad to begin with. That left the ninth-gen iPad, which at that point, didn\u2019t feel like a big enough change from my sixth-gen iPad.\nIn the end, I bought nothing.\nI had the same issue when it came time to upgrade my iPhone this year. There were four iPhone 14 models. I hemmed and hawed. When I eventually bought one, I felt nostalgia for the days when there was one iPhone. The only reason I\u2019m not tearing my hair out over the three Apple Watches that came out this year is that I reviewed all of them. (Plus, I\u2019m still doing some extra Ultra testing.)\nI wouldn\u2019t have had this problem 10 years ago\nI wouldn\u2019t have had this problem 10 years ago. There weren\u2019t seven iPhones, six iPads, five MacBooks, three Apple Watches, three AirPods, and a HomePod in a pear tree. (Throw a few Macs in there, too). Android and Windows have always had a hell of a lot more choices. The whole appeal of Apple\u2019s portfolio was its simplicity.\nIn fact, Tim Cook said the same thing in a Bloomberg interview in 2012:\nYou could almost place every product that we [make] on this table. I mean, if you really look at it, we have four iPods. We have two main iPhones. We have two iPads, and we have a few Macs. That\u2019s it. And we argue and debate like crazy about what we\u2019re going to do, because we know that we can only do a few things great. That means not doing a bunch of things that would be really good and really fun. That\u2019s a part of our base principle, that we will only do a few things. And we\u2019ll only do things where we can make a significant contribution.\nThat simplicity was why I bothered to switch to Apple products in the first place. I put up with the things I didn\u2019t like because it streamlined my workflow and made my life easier \u2014 even if a big part of me bristled at Apple\u2019s heavy-handedness. I didn\u2019t have to do as much research every product season. The only question I had to ask myself was: do I upgrade or wait another year?",

        "body": "A quick search on Twitter reveals that Walmart faces numerous requests to accept Apple Pay on a daily basis, but the big-box retailer still does not accept the iPhone's tap-to-pay service at its over 4,700 stores across the United States.\nWalmart has instead committed to its own payments service called Walmart Pay, available through the Walmart app on the iPhone. Instead of using NFC technology like Apple Pay and many other mobile wallets, Walmart Pay allows customers to scan a QR code displayed at checkout to pay for their purchase with a payment card stored in the app.\n\"We do not accept NFC and instead have implemented convenient solutions, such as Walmart Pay, that provide our customers easy, touchless payments on any smartphone,\" a Walmart spokesperson told MacRumors this week. \"We have also invested in innovative technologies that go beyond payments, such as Scan & Go, which allow Sam's Club and Walmart+ members to bypass the checkout altogether.\"\nThere are certainly some benefits for Walmart in pushing its own mobile payments service, including getting more customers to download the Walmart app, being able to track a customer's purchase history, and avoiding Apple Pay fees, but it's clear that Walmart is ignoring one of its customers' most frequent requests as a result.\nApple Pay launched just over eight years ago, on October 20, 2014. In a press release earlier this year, Apple said that Apple Pay is accepted at more than 90 percent of U.S. retailers, with some major holdouts including Walmart, The Home Depot, Lowe's, and Kroger. Walmart did start accepting Apple Pay in Canada in late 2020.",

        "title": "Backlit Apple Logo Could Make a Comeback on Future MacBooks",
        "body": "Apple could be considering a return of the iconic backlit Apple logo on future MacBook models, if a newly published patent is anything to go by.\nOnce a common sight in coffee shops everywhere, the glowing emblem of an Apple logo featured on the lids of many Mac laptops launched in the early 2000s, but its demise in 2015 could turn out to be relatively short-lived.\nFiled by Apple in May 2022 and published last week by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, a new patent summarizes various implementations of \"Electronic Devices With Backlit Partial Mirror Structures,\" but the illustrated example leaves readers in little doubt about the specific use case Apple has in mind.\n\"An electronic device such as a laptop computer or other device may have a housing. Components such as a display and keyboard may be mounted in the housing. The rear of the housing may be provided with a logo. The logo or other structures in the device may be provided with a backlit partially reflective mirror. The mirror may provide the logo or other structures with a shiny appearance while blocking interior components from view. At the same time, the partial transparency of the mirror allows backlight illumination from within the device to pass through the mirror.\" \"One or more thin-film layers may be configured to provide the partially reflective mirror with desired visible light reflection spectrum, a desired visible light transmission spectrum, and a desired visible light absorption spectrum. The reflectivity of the mirror may be configured so that the mirror serves as a one-way mirror for the logo or other structure. The mirror may have a neutral color such as light gray or may have a non-neutral color such as gold.\"\nPatently Apple, which first highlighted the document, notes that three of the engineers listed on the patent only joined Apple in 2018, long after the backlit logo was dropped from Mac laptops, indicating that a different methodology is being described.\nThe first Mac laptop with a lit-up Apple logo was the third-generation PowerBook G3 launched in 1999, and the glowing symbol proved a mainstay through consecutive Apple notebooks for the next 16 years. The only change in that period was that the logo got flipped upright, so that it no longer appeared upside down to onlookers when someone was sat in public with the lid open.\nIn 2015, Apple began nixing the illuminated insignia from its laptops, starting with the ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook, which had a polished metal logo instead, like those seen on iPads. In 2016, a new generation of MacBook Pro models continued the unlit trend, and Apple hasn't launched a Mac laptop with a glowing logo since.",

The second time around, the tweet was sent via \u201cTwitter for Web.\u201d\nOne of these days, these companies might learn their lesson, but that day doesn\u2019t appear to be today, and something tells us this won\u2019t be the last time there\u2019s a situation like this.",

        "title": "Apple is raising the price of Apple Music, Apple TV+ and Apple One from today",
        "body": "Apple is today increasing the prices of its Apple Music and Apple TV+ subscription services. The Apple One bundle price is also rising in unison.\nThe Apple Music monthly price has been upped by ~$1 for individuals and ~$2 for families. Apple TV+ is rising by $2 (which only has one tier and supports Family Sharing on all plans). Apple One is also going up by approximately $3 per month. Full pricing changes after the break \u2026\nThis represents the first time Apple has raised the subscription price of Music, TV+ and Apple One in the United States.\nApple said the increase in Apple Music subscription price was due to increased licensing costs. The company said artists and songwriters will earn more per stream as a result of the pricing tier changes. Regarding Apple TV+, the company said the increased price reflects the growing catalog of original TV shows and movies:\nFrom an Apple spokesperson:\nThe subscription prices for Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Apple One will increase beginning today. The change to Apple Music is due to an increase in licensing costs, and in turn, artists and songwriters will earn more for the streaming of their music. We also continue to add innovative features that make Apple Music the world\u2019s best listening experience. We introduced Apple TV+ at a very low price because we started with just a few shows and movies. Three years later, Apple TV+ is home to an extensive selection of award-winning and broadly acclaimed series, feature films, documentaries, and kids and family entertainment from the world\u2019s most creative storytellers.\nThis translates to increases of $1 to $2 per service, with Apple One tiers going up about $3 at the same time. Here\u2019s the full pricing breakdown for the United States:\nApple Music\nIndividual: $10.99 per month (from $9.99)\nFamily: $16.99 per month (from $14.99)\nIndividual Annual: $109 per year (from $99)\nApple TV+\nMonthly: $6.99 per month (from $4.99)\nAnnual: $69 per year (from $49.99)\nApple One\nIndividual: $16.95 per month (from $14.95)\nFamily: $22.95 per month (from $19.95)\nPremier: $32.95 per month (from $29.95)\nIf you are in an International market, you should also expect to see proportionally similar price increases go into effect beginning today. Current subscribers will receive notifications of the planned price increases 30 days prior to the service renewing at the higher price.\nApple clearly believes the prices of its content services remain competitive. Unlike its competitors, Apple\u2019s services include more features as standard.\nFor instance, Apple Music includes lossless audio and Spatial Audio at no additional charge, unlike Spotify which doesn\u2019t offer these features today \u2014 and is actually expected to charge extra for them when they are introduced. Similarly, TV+ does not upsell for better video quality; 4K HDR is included as standard.",

        "title": "iPhone 14 Plus Sales 'Lower Than Expected' Following Launch Last Week",
        "body": "Less than a week after the launch of the iPhone 14 Plus, yet another report of unexpectedly low sales for the \u200ciPhone 14\u200c and \u200ciPhone 14\u200c Plus has emerged, suggesting that Apple may actively reduce stock and orders of components for the devices as soon as this month.\nThe paywalled report from DigiTimes claims that sales of the \u200ciPhone 14\u200c and \u200ciPhone 14\u200c Plus are considerably overshadowed by an \"enthusiastic\" response to the iPhone 14 Pro and \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c Max. Sources speaking to DigiTimes say that despite differences in sales performance between the Pro and non-Pro iPhone models this year, total \u200ciPhone 14\u200c model shipments will likely be around the same as those for the iPhone 13 lineup in the second half of 2021.\nIf sales of the \u200ciPhone 14\u200c and \u200ciPhone 14\u200c Plus \"remain flat\" in the near term, Apple purportedly may cut orders of parts to make the devices in the second half of October. If Apple cuts orders more aggressively than expected, then the total \u200ciPhone 14\u200c lineup shipments by the end of the year may even fall compared to the \u200ciPhone 13\u200c series in the same time frame last year. Research indicates that Apple expected to make approximately 90 million new iPhones overall in the second half of 2022, but this could fall to 80 million units due to \"sluggish demand.\"\nThe information mirrors multiple other reports that suggest the \u200ciPhone 14\u200c and \u200ciPhone 14\u200c Plus have not met Apple's sales expectations. Shortly after launch, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that demand for the two devices is \"lackluster,\" with worse pre-order results than the third-generation iPhone SE and the \u200ciPhone 13\u200c mini. He went as far as to claim that \"Apple's product segmentation strategy for standard models fails this year\" and Apple is believed to have shelved plans to increase production of the two devices. Display analyst Ross Young says panel orders for the \u200c\u200ciPhone 14\u200c\u200c are down 38 percent versus the \u200c\u200ciPhone 13\u200c\u200c at the same time last year, while in the resale market, the \u200ciPhone 14\u200c and \u200ciPhone 14\u200c Plus are losing their value twice as fast as the \u200ciPhone 13\u200c mini and \u200ciPhone 13\u200c last year.\nOn the other hand, the \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c and \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c Max reportedly continue to see high demand. Apple is believed to have shifted production away from the non-Pro models to make more \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c and \u200ciPhone 14 Pro\u200c Max devices, as evidenced by increased component shipments.",

Sive was a \u201cfairly senior manager\u201d on the project and had only been at Apple for about two years.\nPrior to joining Apple, Sive held positions at BMW, Tesla, and Google parent company Alphabet\u2019s Waymo. According to Sive\u2019s LinkedIn profile, he will be responsible for vehicle layout, ergonomics, and other tasks at Rivian.\n\u201cDespite his departure, I believe work on the car continues,\u201d Gurman wrote. Apple\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) project has struggled to hold on to management-level members, some of whom left after only a year or two on the team.\nDevelopment on the Apple Car, known internally as \u2018Project Titan,\u2019 is currently led by Apple Watch chief Kevin Lynch. Apple\u2019s efforts to develop a self-driving electric car have seen many a setback, raising questions as to whether they will ever bear fruit.\nEven so, Apple continues to hire just as many automotive executives as it bleeds. Just a couple of months ago, the iPhone maker nabbed longtime Lamborghini executive Luigi Taraborrelli.",

        "title": "The new iPad makes no sense",
        "body": "You heard me. What\u2019s up with this entry-level iPad?\nThe iPad had one thing going for it: price. At $329, the entry-level model has been a real pain in my neck as a laptop reviewer for the past year. Every time I\u2019ve wanted to recommend a budget laptop, Chromebook, or tablet, I\u2019ve had to caveat that the iPad exists and might be a better deal. For multimedia or as a secondary device that didn\u2019t need to accommodate, say, an enterprise workload, $329 was a steal. It was the sole reason I could say \u201cjust get a tablet\u201d to some people without immediately being laughed out of whatever room I happened to be in.\nBut the 10th-gen entry-level iPad starts at $449 \u2014 a 36 percent increase. That\u2019s very much not counting the keyboard you\u2019re supposed to buy with it, which is an extra $249 (oh, and the Apple Pencil is $99 too). That decisive price advantage is, if not gone, significantly mitigated here. And that leaves this entry-level model in a bit of a confusing spot.\nLike, what is all this? Image: Apple\nOver the past few generations, we\u2019ve seen Apple bring the iPad line closer and closer to being, well, computers. Last year, the Pro was equipped with the same eight-core M1 processor that powers the MacBook. It has other laptop bells and whistles, too, including Thunderbolt and 6K external display support. While the 10th-gen iPad is still rocking the A14 Bionic, the new Magic Keyboard now has a full function row \u2014 implying that you should now want to do things like tweak brightness and volume from your keyboard, rather than the screen (which is a thing we do with computers and not with tablets, generally speaking). The device has landscape stereo speakers and dual microphones, as well as Touch ID in the power button. These are all things that seem a bit much for a budget tablet but are right at home in the midrange laptop sphere.\nAnd there\u2019s the pricing. This new iPad is $700 \u2014 $450 plus the $250 keyboard (and $800 if you want the pencil). There\u2019s an M1 MacBook Air listed at Best Buy right now for $849. The new iPad is only $150 away from that MacBook Air.\nThis is risky. Apple must know that it\u2019s risky, and I keep wondering if some of the complaints people have raised about this model (the older chip, the incompatibility with certain accessories) are cut corners because people may not actually buy a ton of these. For one, that $700 only gets you 64GB of storage, while that $849 Air gives you 256GB. (I\u2019ll save you the math \u2014 it\u2019s a quarter of the MacBook\u2019s storage.) Nope. Pass.\nAnd then there\u2019s the other big problem. As much as Apple may want it to be, the iPad is not a computer. It\u2019s just not. This is not a complicated philosophical discussion \u2014 an iPad is not a computer because it runs a tablet operating system, not a computer operating system. Take your finger off that DM button because I will not debate you on this. It\u2019s not a computer.\nThe iPad is not a computer\nAnd there is a myriad of laptop things that iPadOS doesn\u2019t allow you to do. Resizing app windows is a pain. I can only reasonably look at one or two apps at a time, which makes multitasking a hassle. Many of the gold-standard apps I use on a MacBook (Photoshop, for example) don\u2019t have iPadOS equivalents that are up to quite the same standards. And Stage Manager... well, I don\u2019t even really know what\u2019s going on with Stage Manager these days. (Fortunately, it\u2019s not available on the new iPad, a blessing if you ask me.) In the words of Verge editor David Pierce, \u201cWhatever the future looks like, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s piles.\u201d (And that\u2019s before we even talk about the damage a full-on office workload can do to an iPad\u2019s battery life. In my experience, it\u2019s not pretty.) Give me an incredible iPad and an average Windows laptop for free, and I\u2019ll still probably choose the latter for my workday.\nTo sum up: A 36 percent price increase eats into the 9th-Gen iPad\u2019s biggest advantage, which is price. Look, I don\u2019t doubt that this 10th-gen iPad\u2019s performance is an improvement over its predecessors. Apple claims it will perform three times better than the seventh-generation iPad and have all-day battery life. Sure, I\u2019d buy it. But I also haven\u2019t heard many complaints about the 9th-gen iPad in either of those categories, and I\u2019m not convinced that the target audience for this model will appreciate them in the way, say, users of the iPad Pro might. Certainly not 36 percent more.\nThe biggest benefit the iPad always had was the extent to which its price undercut the price of the average Windows (or macOS) laptop. It was really hard for me to recommend a better choice than the iPad at $330; at $450, plus the cost of the keyboard, it\u2019s going to be easier for me to figure something out.\nSo where does the iPad go from here? I\u2019m not totally sure if Apple knows. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if this upcoming year is something of a cornerstone for the iPad line\u2019s direction.\nThere\u2019s value in having a clear budget tablet choice in Apple\u2019s lineup. Maybe Apple decided it was losing that battle to Chromebooks already, and it sees a bigger opening in the midrange-laptop sphere. Maybe it doesn\u2019t care about losing customers to the MacBook because it\u2019s all Apple money in the end. Or maybe it thinks its branding is valuable enough that the entry-level iPad\u2019s audience won\u2019t be deterred by the hike. One thing is clear: Apple wants to charge more for these iPads. The success of this model (compared to the cheaper one, which is still currently on sale for $329) may reveal just how much more they can get away with.",

With WhatsApp you can also set all new chats to disappear with the tap of a button. And last year we introduced end-to-end encrypted backups too. All of which iMessage still doesn't have.\nApple and Meta have had an ongoing rivalry for some time, with the tension between the two tech giants growing more recently.

        "body": "Apple has given its most direct confirmation yet that a USB-C-equipped iPhone will happen now that the European Union is mandating that all phones sold in its member countries use the connector if they have a physical charger.\nWhen asked by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joanna Stern if the company would replace Lightning, Apple\u2019s senior VP of worldwide marketing, Greg Joswiak, answered by saying: \u201cObviously, we\u2019ll have to comply; we have no choice.\u201d\nStern brought the law up during a talk with Joswiak and software VP Craig Federighi at the WSJ\u2019s Tech Live conference and followed up by asking when we can expect to see USB-C on an iPhone. Joswiak replied, \u201cthe Europeans are the ones dictating timing for European customers.\u201d\nCurrently, the law dictates that \u201call mobile phones and tablets\u201d will have to use USB-C by \u201cautumn 2024.\u201d Joswiak refused to answer whether the company would include the connector on phones sold outside the EU.\nBut he made it abundantly clear that Apple isn\u2019t happy about being legally coerced into making the switch. Before acknowledging that the company must comply with the law, Joswiak went into a long explanation about how Apple has historically preferred to go its own way and trust its engineers rather than be forced into adopting hardware standards by lawmakers. He cited the examples of Micro USB and hearing aid compliance as situations where Apple has been pushed to meet ill-considered requirements.\nHe also suggested that charging bricks with detachable cables have mostly solved the issue of standardization and claimed that switching the iPhone from Lightning to USB-C would cause lots of e-waste. (Personally, I don\u2019t find this argument compelling; I have to replace most of my Lightning cables every few years anyways, at around the same cadence I buy new phones because they wear out or get chewed on by cats.)\nStill, it\u2019s telling what didn\u2019t come up: a portless iPhone that relies solely on wireless charging, something that would theoretically be allowed. Joswiak didn\u2019t say that the company is weighing its options or mention discussing ways to avoid putting a USB-C port on the iPhone. Instead, we got a resigned, slightly winding answer that led to what seems like an inevitable conclusion: USB-C is the future port for connecting to and charging your iPhone.",

        "body": "Shipments of MacBooks, iMacs and other Macs during the third quarter of 2022 grew 40.2% year-over-year.\nWindows PC makers shipments all dropped in the same time period, so Apple\u2019s share of global market for traditional computers increased substantially.\nMacs are flying off the shelves\nA dramatic increase in Mac shipments is undoubtedly good news, but the growth is partially caused by the company catching up with demand it was unable to meet earlier in the year. In Q2 2022, Mac shipments dropped 20% as COVID lockdowns in China hurt production. But customers were clearly willing to wait.\nAnd the launch of the 2022 MacBook Air likely buoyed shipments too. The Air is Apple\u2019s most affordable laptop and traditionally the best-selling. The new model got a substantially improved design and the speedy new M2 processor.\nWith those two factors in its favor, Apple shipped 10.1 million Macs in the September quarter, according to the market-researcher firm IDC. That\u2019s a substantial change from the mere 4.7 million MacBooks, iMacs, Mac minis, etc. that shipped in Q2 of this year. And it\u2019s up from 7.2 million in Q3 of last year.\nWindows PC shipments tank\nSupply chain problems stemming from springtime lockdowns in China also dragged down shipments of the top Windows PC makers. The difference between them and Apple is that PC shipments didn\u2019t spring back up in Q3.\nLenovo\u2019s shipments experienced an annual decline of 16.1%, while HP\u2019s dropped 27.8% and Dell\u2019s went down 21.2%. Asus saw a more moderate decline of 7.8%.\nApple shipments growing while its top rivals drop resulting in a Cupertino\u2019s share of the global PC market increasing to 13.5%. This time last year, it was at 8.2%.",

        "title": "Apple's New iPad Lineup Causes Potential Confusion With Inconsistent Features",
        "body": "The launch of a new iPad Pro and entry-level iPad means that Apple's \u200ciPad\u200c lineup is the largest it has been in recent memory. The wide range of choices, inconsistent features, and confusing compatibility with accessories may be a source of confusion for customers looking for a new \u200ciPad\u200c.\nOne of the newest additions to the \u200ciPad\u200c lineup is the 10th-generation entry-level \u200ciPad\u200c. Compared to the ninth-generation model, which remains in the lineup at a lower starting price, it's a major update featuring a new design and a USB-C port. The new \u200ciPad\u200c, however, is eerily similar to the fifth-generation iPad Air.\nBoth the latest \u200ciPad Air\u200c and entry-level \u200ciPad\u200c have the same full-screen design with no Home Button, a Touch ID sensor embedded in the Power button, a 10.9-inch display, a single camera system, and support for 5G. The two iPads are extremely similar, with the only difference being the lack of support for the second-generation Apple Pencil on the entry-level \u200ciPad\u200c, minor changes in the displays, and the chip.\nThe latest \u200ciPad Air\u200c has the M1 Apple silicon chip, while the new entry-level \u200ciPad\u200c is powered by the A14 Bionic chip. While the \u200cM1\u200c chip is more powerful than the A14 Bionic, customers are unlikely to see major differences in day-to-day use. With iPadOS 16, however, there are some ways the \u200cM1\u200c chip will enable newer experiences not available on the entry-level \u200ciPad\u200c, most notably Stage Manager.\nThe 10th-generation \u200ciPad\u200c does not support the second-generation \u200cApple Pencil\u200c, meaning it only works with the original stylus. The first-generation \u200cApple Pencil\u200c requires a Lightning port in order to charge, unlike the newer model which charges magnetically. Since the new \u200ciPad\u200c has a USB-C port, customers will have to purchase an adapter to charge their first-generation Apple Pencil on their iPad. Design-wise, the new \u200ciPad\u200c is the first to feature a landscape FaceTime camera.\nOther than the \u200ciPad Air\u200c and entry-level \u200ciPad\u200c, customers can still choose the ninth-generation baseline \u200ciPad\u200c as an option. The ninth-generation \u200ciPad\u200c features a Home Button, a smaller 10.2-inch display, the A13 Bionic chip, and a Lightning connector. Between the three \u200ciPad\u200c models, customers are left to choose between differences in performance, design, and compatibility for \u200cApple Pencil\u200c.\nAt the higher end of the lineup, customers can choose the new \u200ciPad Pro\u200c, now powered by the M2 Apple silicon chip. The \u200ciPad Pro\u200c is offered in 11-inch and 12.9-inch sizes and is the only \u200ciPad\u200c model with advanced features like ProMotion, a LiDAR scanner, a USB\u2011C connector with support for Thunderbolt, and Face ID. The iPad mini is also an option for customers who solely want the smallest and most portable \u200ciPad\u200c possible.",

While there's a 'Fitness' app available, it's only for Fitness Plus users to help perform the video workouts that are available as part of their subscriptions, which feels like a missed opportunity.\nWith macOS Ventura, iOS 16.1 and iPadOS 16.1 all scheduled to arrive later today (October 24), I want to see Apple make these two apps available on every device, not just on iPhone and Apple Watch.\nLet's check those rings on macOS and iPadOS\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\nHealth matters to Apple - you see it everywhere, from the privacy settings that keep your information safe from others, to the many different features that Apple Watch offers in monitoring your heart, blood oxygen levels and more.\nChecking your fitness on the new Lock Screen in iOS 16 is great, but I want Apple to go further. I want to see the ability to place extra-large fitness widgets on an iPadOS home screen, for example, or at least be able to see Health and Fitness updates that I can access from the macOS menubar.\nAll of these would be massively helpful to me and others, as we'd be able to see how our move goals are going without raising our wrists or tapping our iPhone displays.\nHealth isn't limited to the smartphones we use - it's everywhere, and it should be easier to access, rather than feeling like an exclusive feature to iOS and watchOS.\nWe're at the point where we're wondering what we could see in iOS 17, watchOS 10 and macOS 14, and now that widgets finally have their place on iPhone and iPad, let's see health and fitness arrive on Mac and iPad in as big a way as they have on Watch and iPhone for the last few years.",

        "body": "Apple could be planning to replace the clickable volume and power buttons on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max next year with solid-state buttons. Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo shared this detail, comparing it to when the iPhone 7 replaced the clickable Home button with a solid-state Home button.\nSolid-state buttons\nKuo predicts this change will happen on the high-end iPhone models released in the second half of next year.\n\u201cMy latest survey indicates that the volume button and power button of two high-end iPhone 15/2H23 new iPhone models may adopt a solid-state button design (similar to the home button design of iPhone 7/8/SE2 & 3) to replace the physical/mechanical button design,\u201d Kuo predicts.\nThat means this is one change we could see on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max\u2026 or Ultra? Either way, the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will stick to clicky buttons. This could be marketed as added durability for the higher-end iPhones. Let\u2019s call that another point for the \u201cUltra\u201d marketing possibility.\nThree Taptic Engines\nLike with the Home button, Kuo says Apple will rely on Taptic Engine vibration motors to simulate the feeling of a click.\n\u201cLike with the Home button, Kuo says Apple will rely on Taptic Engine vibration motors to simulate the feeling of a click,\u201d Kuo writes. \u201cDue to this design change, the number of Taptic Engines used in each iPhone will increase from the current one to three. As a result, the existing Taptic Engine suppliers, Luxshare ICT (1st supplier) and AAC Technologies (2nd supplier) will be significant beneficiaries.\u201d\niPhone 15 is also expected to be the first series to drop Lightning in favor of USB-C. We\u2019re only a month out from the iPhone 14 launch, and we\u2019re already getting a clearer picture of what to expect eleven months from now.\n9to5Mac\u2019s Take\nWhat may be most interesting about iPhone 15 Pro going solid-state is that it could happen before the Apple Watch.\nApple Watch Ultra sort of shows that you don\u2019t exactly need solid-state buttons to have extreme durability though. On the other hand, I\u2019ve definitely gunked up the volume and power buttons on recent iPhones from exposure to the elements and my five-year-old.\nWhat do you think about solid-state volume and power buttons coming to the iPhone 15 Pro? Fewer parts to fail or more complexity with additional Taptic Engines? Let us know what you think.",

At its September 7 \u201cFar Out\u201d event, Apple introduced the iPhone 14 line, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Ultra, and second-generation AirPods Pro. Plus, we got the release of iOS 16 and watchOS 9.\nYou might expect that October would pale in comparison, but Apple still has a lot going on. There\u2019s still one iPhone 14 to come, and potentially a handful of iPads, Macs, and possibly more. We expect some really important operating system updates as well\u2013especially as the iPad and Mac are a little behind the iPhone in getting their big yearly update.\nNew hardware\nApple\u2019s still got some hardware to release this year. There could be an event in October, or perhaps none at all, just a steady stream of press-releases and website updates. Here\u2019s what we think will be announced and released in October.\niPhone 14 Plus: The one product we are sure is releasing in October is the iPhone 14 Plus, the 6.7-inch version of the standard (non-Pro) iPhone. Already available for preorder, it hits shelves and mailboxes on Friday, October 7.\nM2 Mac mini: The Mac mini hasn\u2019t been updated since the M1 chip was launched in 2020, and for some reason Apple still sells the Intel version as well. It\u2019s expected that new models are on the way with the M2 and M2 Pro, and possibly a slight redesign.\nM2 MacBook Pros: The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are only a year old, but those M1 Pro and M1 Max chips are expected to get the M2 treatment. Otherwise, the laptops should be similar.\nM2 iPad Pros: The 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro still come with the M1 processor. Now that the M2 has been out for months, it\u2019s time they were upgraded, which is expected to happen soon. Not much else about the iPad Pro models is expected to change, though, other than the possible addition of wireless charging.\nEveryone\u2019s iPhone got a huge upgrade with iOS 16, which was accompanied by watchOS 9 and tvOS 16. But the iPadOS release, which typically comes at the same time, was skipped\u2013iPadOS 16.1 will be the first release for that hardware. It\u2019s not uncommon for macOS to be a little behind the mobile devices, and we expect macOS Ventura to land this month, too.\nThe iPhone\u2019s first big update, iOS 16.1, will have a number of important features when it comes this month, too.\niOS 16.1: The first big iOS update after iOS 16 will add some significant features, like Live Activities, improvements to the battery percentage indicator, a \u201cClean Energy Charging\u201d feature, support for the Matter smart home standard (maybe), and more. It\u2019s in beta now, and will probably release in October.\n\u200ctvOS 16.1: There\u2019s not a lot of big new stuff in tvOS 16.1, other than maybe support for the Matter smart home standard, but it will update to keep on pace with iOS.\niPadOS 16.1: This will be the first public release in the iPadOS 16 cycle\u2013Apple is skipping iPadOS 16.0. The biggest feature is the new Stage Manager feature, which Apple keeps making major changes to in the hopes of getting it into good shape for launch.\nmacOS Ventura: Also known as macOS 13, \u201cVentura\u201d brings a bunch of welcome features like using your iPhone as a wireless webcam, Passkey, shared iCloud Photo Library, lifting subjects from photos like on iOS 16, a new Settings app (which needs work), and more. We think it will launch together with iPadOS 16.1.\nServices\nApple TV+\nHere are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in October.
