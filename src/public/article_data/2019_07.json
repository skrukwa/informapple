        "body": "Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak deleted his personal Facebook account last year and is now telling everyone else they should do the same. Woz was stopped by TMZ at Reagan National Airport in D.C. recently and warned that the lack of privacy on the platform isn\u2019t worth it for most people, adding a warning more generally, \u201cwho knows if my cellphone is listening right now?\u201d\n\u201cThere are many different kinds of people, and some the benefits of Facebook are worth the loss of privacy,\u201d Wozniak told TMZ. \u201cBut to many like myself, my recommendation is\u2014to most people\u2014you should figure out a way to get off Facebook.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWoz said that while he\u2019s worried about the invasions of privacy by Big Tech, he didn\u2019t think there was anything that could be done to stop it.\n\u201cBut, everything about you... I mean, they can measure your heartbeat with lasers now, they can listen to you with a lot of devices. Who knows if my cellphone\u2019s listening right now. Alexa has already been in the news a lot,\u201d Woz told TMZ.\n\u201cSo I worry because you\u2019re having conversations that you think are private... You\u2019re saying words that really shouldn\u2019t be listened to, because you don\u2019t expect it. But there\u2019s almost no way to stop it,\u201d Woz said.\nAdvertisement Advertisement\nWozniak originally dumped Facebook just three weeks after the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in March of 2018. That scandal revealed that private firms were using Facebook data to help manipulate the 2016 presidential election in favor of President Donald Trump by monitoring user moods and behaviors on the platform. Facebook has since been implicated in plenty of other transgressions, including being complicit in genocide in Myanmar according to a report from the UN. Facebook admitted that its platform had been used to \u201cfoment division and incite offline violence.\u201d\nWozniak\u2019s solution, which you can hear in the the entire TMZ video on YouTube, is one that has admittedly been floated before: Just let everyone pay for their privacy.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPeople think they have a level of privacy they don\u2019t. Why don\u2019t they give me a choice? Let me pay a certain amount, and you\u2019ll keep my data more secure and private then everybody else handing it to advertisers.\u201d\nBest of luck with that, Woz. Best of luck to us all, really.\nAdvertisement\nCorrection: This post originally said that TMZ talked to Woz in L.A. It was in Washington D.C. Gizmodo regrets the error.",

        "body": "UPDATE 7/23/19: BMW's ConnectedDrive website is advertising fees of $80 for 12 months of Apple CarPlay service or a 240-month (that's 20 years) membership for $300.\nBMW will turn Apple CarPlay into a subscription service beginning with its 2019-model-year vehicles.\nThe German automaker currently charges a one-time $300 to add Apple CarPlay capability to navigation-equipped BMW models. Going forward, though, navigation-equipped BMWs will come with CarPlay at no charge for one year. Following that first year, customers will need to pay an annual fee of $80 to maintain the relationship between their Apple device and their BMW's infotainment system.\nBMWs currently are not compatible with Android Auto, although the company did announce its plans to integrate Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa services into its vehicles. A BMW spokesperson was unable to confirm whether the company plans to use a subscription-based model for using these services in their vehicles.\nRegardless, BMW's decision to charge a yearly fee for CarPlay is contrary to industry norms, as all other automakers include the service as a standard or optional feature that spans the life of the vehicle, similar to a sunroof or AM/FM radio. We'll see if other manufacturers follow BMW's lead in the future or whether the market will force the automaker to fall back into line and provide it at no extra cost.",

        "title": "Apple's Rainbow Logo May Return to Some New Products as Early as This Year",
        "body": "Apple may be planning to reintroduce its classic rainbow logo on some of its new products as early as this year, according to a well-connected MacRumors tipster, who in turn cites a corporate Apple employee in Cupertino.\nMacRumors concept\nWe don't know which products might be involved, but the Mac would be a good candidate, as the multicolored Apple logo was used on the original Macintosh in 1984 and on many other Apple computers before and after it. iPhones and iPads could also be suitable \u2014 perhaps special editions along the lines of (PRODUCT)RED.\nTo be clear, this rumor could very well be untrue. We have elected to share it since it comes from a tipster who has longstanding connections to both Apple and related industries, but no other sources have shared similar information that we know of. And, even if true, the plans could certainly change.\nMacRumors concept\nApple's rainbow or \"six-color\" logo made its debut on the Apple II computer in 1977 and was widely used until 1998, when it began to be phased out in favor of a monochrome Apple logo similar to the one used today.\nDespite not officially using its rainbow logo in over 20 years, Apple has continued to embrace its colors over the years.\nApple Park was recently decorated with the colors of the rainbow logo in celebration of the formal opening of Apple's new headquarters, and as a tribute to Steve Jobs. The colors were splashed on stairs, walkways, coffee cups, and even a stage with a rainbow arch used for an employee-only Lady Gaga performance.\nApple's departing design chief Jony Ive recently reflected on the rainbow's significance:\nThere is the resonance with the rainbow logo that's been part of our identity for many years. The rainbow is also a positive and joyful expression of some of our inclusion values and I think that one of the primary reasons the idea resonated so immediately and so profoundly with us was the form -- the connection from an aesthetic design point of view. A semi-circle relates so beautifully and naturally to the form of the ring.\nAgain, we do not know if this rumor is true, but our tipster is reputable enough in our opinion for us to at least share what we have heard.",

        "body": "The Retina MacBook Air was refreshed last week with a new price and the addition of a True Tone display. The refresh was minor, with the same CPUs as 2018, but a $100 cheaper price point: the 2019 MacBook Air starts at $1099 from Apple, with $999 student pricing.\nIt turns out that one downside to this latest revision is that the laptop actually features slower solid state storage than the 2018 model.\nAs tested by Consomac using the Blackmagic Disk Speed Test, the 2019 MacBook Air can attain read speeds of 1.3 GB/s read and 1 GB/s write performance.\nThe equivalent 256 GB SSD 2018 MacBook Air could top 2 GB/s read and around 0.9 GB/s write speeds. Therefore, the new SSD component in use has marginally superior write speeds but 35% slower read speeds, falling from 2 GB/s to 1.3 GB/s. (The 128 GB SSD option has slower 0.5 GB/s write speeds, but this drop-off was also observed in the 128 GB 2018 Air.)\nBenchmark via Consomac.\nPresumably, the slower SSD is a cheaper component for Apple to pack into the machine and helped the company achieve the $100 price drop, and even more aggressive education pricing for students.\nIn truth, this compromise was probably the right tradeoff to make. The lower price will make the machine appeal to dramatically more people, and disproportionally few MacBook Air users will notice the slower SSD read speeds in normal usage. A 35% slower SSD does not automatically translate into an overall performance loss of 35%.\nA 1.3 GB/s SSD is still sufficiently fast enough that most heavy computing tasks performed on the Air will be primarily pegged by the CPU or GPU or RAM constraints, making the additional SSD speed overhead a little superfluous. Of course, it will be slower. But for typical laptop needs, it should be just fine.",

But a narrative is forming to suggest that he\u2019s been slowly exiting for years as the company shifted priorities from product design to operations. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Tripp Mickle just published a new list of brutalities that paints a picture of discontent inside Apple, that\u2019s responsible for \u201ceroding the product magic\u201d created by the union of Apple\u2019s genius CEO and genius designer.\nThe WSJ report follows a similar piece published by Bloomberg last week. Both reports describe an Apple design team, led by Jony Ive, increasingly frustrated by his absence after the launch of the Apple Watch in 2015. They tell the story of a company that once put design at the forefront, progressively being led by operational concerns. Ive\u2019s absence was \u201cstraining the cohesion central to product development,\u201d according to the WSJ, causing several key design team members to leave Apple over the last few years.\nHere are some of the highlights from The Wall Street Journal piece that\u2019s well worth a read in full:",

        "body": "The Information's Wayne Ma has published an interesting story about the measures Apple takes to prevent leaks of unreleased products like iPhones from emerging out of factories within its Asian supply chain.\nAfter photos of the colorful iPhone 5c leaked in 2013, the report claims Apple created a \"New Product Security\" team to monitor security at its most sensitive suppliers in China. At one point, the team reportedly topped more than 30 people, but Apple is said to have been moving some of the work to contractors as of late.\nApple recruited former U.S. military and intelligence operatives fluent in Chinese to be security managers on the team, and hired third-party auditors tasked with visiting factories on a weekly basis, the report adds.\nThe security team is said to have uncovered workers going to extreme lengths to smuggle valuable components out of factories over the years, with some attempting to hide parts in crawl spaces, tissue boxes, shoes, belt buckles, bras, used mop water, under discarded metal shavings, and beyond.\nApple once even caught factory workers \"digging a small tunnel in a corner of a room behind a large piece of machinery,\" hoping to use it to funnel stolen components to the outside, according to the report. \"People were chipping away little by little at the wall 'Shawshank Redemption' style,\" one person said.\nOver the years, Apple has tightened its security protocols even further to prevent leaks.\nExamples from the report: trash bags must be clear and screened for metal before they are removed from the premises, storage containers must be sealed with tamper-evident stickers, parts must have unique serial numbers that can be traced back to specific factory lines, and inventory must be counted daily.\nSuppliers who suffer leaks may face multi-million-dollar fines, according to the report, although Apple's primary manufacturer Foxconn is said to be excluded from this policy due to the size of its relationship with Apple.\nThe full article at The Information is a fascinating read, with several more details about Apple's efforts to curb leaks.

        "title": "Why this year's iPhones should be the last with lightning",
        "body": "As per usual, rumors surrounding the next iPhone are starting to coalesce into a consistent set of expectations. The latest information comes from the very reliable Guilherme Rambo of 9to5Mac, suggesting that this year\u2019s iPhone 11 will come in two sizes (plus a successor to the iPhone XR), have OLED screens on the top tier devices, keep the same resolution across the entire lineup, add a wide angle camera, improve the selfie camera, have some sort of fancy haptics, and finally: charge via the Lightning connector.\nIt\u2019s that last part that has irked people in my social media feed \u2014 though perhaps that\u2019s because I am somehow embedded in some kind of USB-C enthusiast bubble (Twitter is weird). Still, the sentiment seems to be that sticking with Lightning port on the iPhone 11 is disappointing.\nAs somebody who has long griped that the iPhone is nearly the only device in my life that doesn\u2019t charge via USB-C, you\u2019d probably expect me to also think Apple should be switching away from Lightning this year. I don\u2019t.\nAssuming the rumors are correct, Apple is making the right move by keeping the Lightning connector this year. Any kind of port change is traumatic and annoying, so I can\u2019t blame Apple for wanting to avoid it if at all possible. But that\u2019s not the reason I think it\u2019s the right call.\nKeeping Lightning this year is the right move, even though it still bums me out\nI think it\u2019s easier to get people to accept port changes when they go along with some other kind of dramatic change to a product line. And not to put too fine a point on it: if the rumors are correct, this year\u2019s iPhone 11 doesn\u2019t look like a very dramatic change.\nI think that big changes in product lines can create a context shift in consumers minds. If a company can convince consumers that the gadget with the different plug on it is different, then it makes more sense that it would use a different port. USB on the original iMac is probably the canonical example of using a new device to help explain the necessity for new ports, but I could also point to USB-C on both the 2015 MacBook and the 2018 iPad Pro.\nI always wanted the iPhone X to start the USB-C shift. It was a radically new design for Apple, one that purported to be the start of a whole new era of iPhones. It would have been the perfect moment for the company to say \u201cthis is the future, and in the future everything uses the same cable until we can get rid of them entirely.\u201d And if consumers weren\u2019t ready to embrace that future, the traditional iPhones were still available and still very good.\nApple decided to stick with Lightning, though, and to me it was a missed opportunity. And it\u2019s no surprise it stuck with them for the iPhone XS the following year.\nApple has been much more cautious about the main port on the iPhone than it has been on the Mac. This is the part where you crack jokes about the \u201ccourage\u201d of removing the headphone jack, but it does make me wonder: if Apple was willing to foist that kind of change on users, why doesn\u2019t that courage extend to changing the charging port?\nThere are lots of reasons, actually. Some of them have already been clearly elucidated by John Gruber back in November, 2018. But basically: the Lightning connector is, in some ways, superior to USB-C. It\u2019s smaller and more tightly controlled by Apple. That second part ensures quality control if you trust Apple and inspires theories about Apple making money through its MFI program if you don\u2019t. Whatever the justification, it\u2019s totally reasonable to keep the Lightning port on the iPhone.\nApple\u2019s MacBook and iPad customers would get fast charging for free if Apple switched the iPhone over to USB-C\n...Until it\u2019s not, and I think in 2020 it won\u2019t be reasonable. By then, a critical mass of Apple users will have at least one device (probably their laptop or an iPad Pro) that charges via USB-C.\nI\u2019m not predicting that more people will want Apple to switch, but that eventually the benefits of switching to USB-C will outweigh the benefits of staying with Lightning. At some point the Lightning cable will be the thing that feels like an extraneous dongle, one more incompatible thing you have to tote around.\nThe biggest benefit of switching to USB-C is obviously having the same charger handle your laptop, tablet, and phone. It\u2019s just so much more convenient. In fact, if companies offered me the chance to buy their devices without an AC adapter for even a small discount, I would take them up on it in a heartbeat. It would be better for the environment, too.\nAnd in that world, Apple could get away with shipping the anemic power adapter it continues to pack in with the iPhone \u2014 because many of its users will already have a fast charger, likely the one that came with their laptop.\nWill it be painful, annoying, and cause a backlash against Apple? Yes, yes, and yes. The change from the 30-pin to Lightning was much more dramatic than any port change on an Android phone ever was. There are so many options in Android that changes like these tend to get lost in the mix anyway. But when Apple makes a change to the iPhone, all hell tends to break loose.\nLightning is increasingly a hassle in 2019. In 2020, it\u2019ll be an embarrassment\nIf you\u2019re going to let all hell break loose, it had better be worth it. You need a big new narrative to justify the switch. That\u2019s why I think this year\u2019s iPhone 11 isn\u2019t the right phone to do it.\nBut next year\u2019s iPhone 12 (or whatever it will be called)? Switch, it will be time. Rumors of the 2020 iPhone have already begun, and they include a full-screen fingerprint sensor and the death of the notch. It sounds like a big, exciting new design. It might even be the kind that people would line up for and accept a port change on.\nIn the meantime, I won\u2019t gripe about 2019\u2019s iPhone 11 using Lightning. It\u2019s a very good connector, just one that shouldn\u2019t wear out its welcome for much longer.",

        "title": "iPhone XR nearly half of recent US iPhone sales ahead of iPhone 11 launch - 9to5Mac",
        "body": "CIRP has released a new report today with its estimates for how well each iPhone model sold during Apple\u2019s Q3 (calendar Q2). In addition to the iPhone XR being far and away the most popular iPhone in the US ahead of the upcoming iPhone 11 launch, the firm has data on how well Apple\u2019s Services are doing with iPhone owners.\nHeadlining the report are the results on iPhone sales in the US for the June quarter. The iPhone XR has easily become the most popular model representing 48% Apple\u2019s smartphone sales for the period in CIRP\u2019s data. That percentage is higher than what the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X sales combined tallied up to in the same period last year.\n\u201ciPhone XR has become the dominant iPhone model,\u201d said Josh Lowitz, CIRP Partner and Co-Founder. \u201cIts 48% share of sales in the quarter is the highest we\u2019ve seen for an individual model since the iPhone 6 in 2015, which shared top billing with the 6 Plus, but only had two outdated legacy models offered as alternatives. Apple set out to create a competitive model, with current features like a large screen on a midsize handset, at a price that falls near the leading Android phones. Lowitz noted the iPhone XR is an easy pick for consumers sitting between the older iPhone 7 and 8 models and the more expensive iPhone XS and XS Max. Apple\u2019s latest iPhone lineup, the XR, XS, and XS Max made up 67% of US sales for the company\u2019s Q3.\nCIRP also released its latest numbers on how Apple\u2019s Services are doing with iPhone owners. The firm found 35% of iPhone users were signed up for Apple Music while 48% were on a paid iCloud plan.\nAlmost 30% were using Apple Podcasts, 15% using Apple News and Apple TV. A low 3-6% had purchased AppleCare for their iPhone or iPad.\nCIRP co-founder and partner Mike Levin noted the variance in performance based on how long Apple has been operating its various Services. \u201cSuccess in services has varied, depending on the competition and how much of a head-start Apple has,\u201d said Mike Levin, CIRP Partner and Co-Founder. \u201cFor example, for a long time Apple had one of the only apps for podcasts, so its podcast app has the highest penetration for iPhone buyers. In contrast, Apple TV competes against Netflix and other streaming video services, and has lower penetration. Even though Apple has offered extended warranties for many years, mobile carriers and retailers like Best Buy offer their own and third-party warranties, so AppleCare has a much lower penetration., After Apple discontinued iTunes, Apple Music is its unififed music service, yet its 35% share still puts it behind Spotify and Pandora.\u201d We\u2019ll learn more about how Apple performed during the June quarter with its Q3 earnings call scheduled for July 30.",

        "body": "Apple Park is one of the most impressive corporate headquarters in the world \u2014 and that don\u2019t come cheap.\nIn fact, it\u2019s one of the most valuable buildings on Earth. A recent assessment for property tax by Santa Clara County lists Apple\u2019s circular HQ at $3.6 billion. This is based on a detailed appraisal of the building. Including its contents, it\u2019s valued at $4.17 billion.\nThat latter figure includes computers, furniture (such as the hand-selected fancy chairs picked by Jony Ive), and farm equipment to take care of the property\u2019s grounds.\nProperty taxes of 1% mean that Apple likely pays around $40 million annually. (That\u2019s a whole lot of iPhones before it even covers the cost of keeping Apple Park street legal.) However, Apple could potentially appeal the valuation in an effort to lower its tax bill. This is something that it has previously done for other buildings.\nThe company was Santa Clara County\u2019s largest property taxpayer for the 2017-18 fiscal year. In total, it paid $56 million in taxes.\nOne of the world\u2019s most valuable buildings\nAs the SF Chronicle notes:\n\u201cApple Park is among the world\u2019s dozen most expensive buildings, despite its relatively modest four-story height. America\u2019s tallest spire, the 1,776-foot One World Trade Center in New York, cost $3.9 billion to build, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the building, and is 3.5 million square feet. Singapore\u2019s Marina Bay Sands resort reportedly topped $5 billion in costs, while Finland\u2019s Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor exceeded $6 billion.\u201d\nThe article also has one other intriguing tidbit. The Salesforce Tower, San Francisco\u2019s tallest building, was valued at just half the amount of Apple Park. Despite being stretched over 57 floors instead of, well, four, it also has just half the office space.",

        "body": "Apple this week updated its entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar and Intel's latest 8th-generation Core quad-core processors, and benchmarks for the 2019 model are now beginning to surface.\nGeekbench 4 scores indicate the base 2019 model with an 8th-generation 1.4GHz quad-core Core i5 processor has up to a 6.8 percent increase in single-core performance, and up to 83.4 percent faster multi-core performance, compared to the base 2017 model with a 7th-generation 2.3GHz dual-core Core i5 processor.\nSpecifically, the 2019 model has average single-core and multi-core scores of 4,639 and 16,665 respectively based on eight Geekbench results, while the 2017 model averages 4,341 for single-core and 9,084 for multi-core.\nThe new entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro is powered by Intel's Core i5-8257U processor, which appears to be a custom variation of its Core i5-8250U processor designed for Apple. The 15W chip is part of the Coffee Lake family and has a max Turbo Boost frequency of up to 3.9GHz.\nThe notebook can also be upgraded to an 8th-generation 1.7GHz quad-core Core i7 processor. This configuration uses Intel's Core i7-8557U, which is likewise believed to be a custom variation of its Core i7-8550U processor, with a TDP of 15W and a max Turbo Boost frequency of up to 4.5GHz.\nOnly one Geekbench result is available for the 1.7GHz configuration so far with single-core and multi-core scores of 4,835 and 15,515 respectively. There is room for variance here as more results come in, but this would be a performance increase of up to around 60 percent compared to the equivalent 2017 model.\nApple advertises the new entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro as \"two times more powerful\" than the previous generation. The benchmarks approach this at up to 83 percent, but performance in real-world usage will vary.\nApple did not update the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro in 2018, which is why 2017 models serve as the previous-generation comparisons.",

        "body": "Xiaomi Accidentally Uses Apple Video to Advertise Controversial Mimoji Phone\nby Tianyu M. Fang / Jul 05, 2019 04:26 PM / Business & Tech\nXiaomi\u2019s augmented-reality avatar set, Mimoji, is definitely not a clone of Apple\u2019s Memoji \u2014 they just look very similar and happen to share identical-sounding names \u2014 the Chinese company clarified last week.\nBut ads for Apple\u2019s Memoji and Apple Music have been embedded on Xiaomi\u2019s product page for the Mi CC9 smartphone on e-commerce platforms JD.com and Suning, in lieu of original Xiaomi graphics, a Weibo user found on Friday.\nXu Jieyun, Xiaomi\u2019s general manager for public relations, responded in a Weibo comment that the e-commerce mix-up was caused by staff \u201cuploading the wrong content.\u201d\nThe company has faced skepticism after unveiling its Mi CC9 smartphone, which has the Mimoji feature built in. Social media users and tech websites have pointed out the striking resemblance between a new range of human Mimoji and Apple\u2019s Memoji, which were introduced last year. Both functions allow smartphone users to create 3D characters that mirror their own facial expressions.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Xiaomi has been accused of copying Apple. According to Vanity Fair, Apple\u2019s head of design Jony Ive once called Xiaomi out at a conference: \u201cYou spend seven or eight years working on something, and then it\u2019s copied. . . . I think it\u2019s theft, and it\u2019s lazy.\u201d\nWhatever the origin of Mimoji, it\u2019s unlikely that the similarities between Xiaomi and Apple avatars will spark a legal dispute. Apple doesn\u2019t own the concept of augmented reality avatars, which many companies have already dabbled in. In fact, the U.S. trademark for Memoji doesn't belong to Apple -- it was filed with patent authorities by a little-known tech company based in Atlanta, Georgia, in April 2016.\nRelated: Xiaomi CEO Tries to Follow in Steve Jobs\u2019 Footsteps\nContact editor Teng Jing Xuan (jingxuanteng@caixin.com)",

Apple has issued a silent, automatic update to macOS that removes the web server used to streamline access to the video conferencing app. The update isn't completely necessary when Zoom has already issued its own patch, but this ensures that people running older Zoom releases won't be vulnerable.\nZoom told TechCrunch that it partnered with Apple to test the fix. It shouldn't affect functionality other than requiring your permission to launch the app.\nWe've asked Apple for comment.\nApple is known to deliver quiet updates to block malware. This, however, is another story -- the company is pushing an update to fix a problem with an above-board developer that has over four million users. Neither Apple nor Zoom wanted to take any chances, even if the practical threat of someone using the exploit is slim.",

It doesn't block the numbers entirely, but it will help you stop your phone from ringing at all if an unknown number calls.\nOpen Settings.\nTap \"Phone.\"\nNow scroll down and toggle the option to \"Silence Unknown Callers.\"\nThis automatically sends unknown callers to voicemail. There are times where you might want to leave this off, though.\nIf you're expecting a call from a doctor you might not have in your address book, then you should turn the feature off to prevent their call from going to voicemail. Or, if you regularly receive important calls for business that you might not always recognize, then again this feature might not help you much. At least everyone can still leave you a voicemail.\nGoogle has a feature I like even more on its new Pixel phones, which automatically screens calls and uses the Google Assistant to speak with the person on the other end. I don't see Apple adding something similar soon, but it might not need to if wireless carriers are able to do a bulk of the blocking on their end.",

In a support document, Apple says that starting in November 2019, some \u200ciPhone\u200c and \u200ciPad\u200c models introduced in 2012 and earlier will require this update to maintain an accurate GPS location due to the GPS time rollover issue that began affecting GPS-enabled products from other manufacturers on April 6, 2019.\nApple recommends all users with eligible devices install the new updates. Apple devices won't be affected until November 3, 2019, so there should be plenty of time for users with affected iPhones and iPads to install the new software.\nAccording to Apple, those who don't update to the new version of iOS by November 3 might see their iPhones and iPads failing to maintain an accurate GPS position, and features that rely on correct date and time, like syncing with iCloud and fetching email, might not work.",

On iPhone , users can create and customize their Memoji, and then send them as videos or stickers in Messages, and it appears that Xiaomi's Mimoji will act in a similar fashion.\nOf course, the idea of personalized 3D avatars has been around for a while, with companies like Samsung and Microsoft letting users create digital versions of themselves to use on smartphones, consoles, and elsewhere. With Xiaomi's decision to name its version of this idea Mimoji, however, the inspiration appears to be derived mostly from Apple.\nApple's Memoji\nThis isn't the first time that Xiaomi copied an emoji-related idea from Apple, as the company launched the equivalent of Apple's Animojis on its Mi 8 smartphone last year . This device also strongly resembled the \u200ciPhone\u200c X design, with its own notch and vertical dual-lens camera. There was also an AirPods clone released by Xiaomi earlier in 2019\nXiaomi's CC9 smartphone will go on sale in China on July 5.\nUpdate: In a Xiaomi press release, translated by Twitter user @e_l_l_l, the company refutes claims that Mimoji is a clone of Apple's Memoji: \"We have conducted internal audits and found no evidences that our Mimoji characters have [been] plagiarized from any of our competitors including Apple.\"",

        "title": "Apple Reimbursed Samsung $683 Million After Missing OLED Display Targets",
        "body": "Apple reimbursed Samsung 800 billion won ($683 million) to cover the cost of OLED panels after Apple missed a sales target both companies had agreed upon.\nApple originally said it would buy a certain number of the display panels from the South Korean company, but disappointing iPhone sales meant it was unable to live up to the agreement. The payment was made in the second quarter of this year.\nThe figure, quoted by Reuters, came as Samsung on Friday forecast a plunge in its second-quarter operating profits, but one-off gains like the payment from Apple helped it beat analyst expectations.\nSamsung's April-June operating profit likely fell 56 percent to 6.5 trillion won ($5.6 billion), the company revealed in a regulatory filing ahead of the release of its detailed earnings figures in late July. Revenue probably fell 4.2 percent from a year earlier to 56 trillion won ($48 billion).\nSamsung is on track to post year-on-year profit declines for a third consecutive quarter, mainly due to a combination of falling chip prices because of a supply glut and U.S. sanctions on Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei, which has become a key Samsung client.\nThe U.S.-China trade war is also impacting global chip and smartphone markets, with rising tariffs hitting demand for electronics. In a striking example of the ongoing feud between the two countries, Seoul also cut its annual economic growth target to a seven-year low as exports continued to slump.",

        "body": "For iOS 13, iPadOS 13, and macOS Catalina beta testers, Apple is trying out a new sign-in process for iCloud on the web. When you head to beta.icloud.com on a device running the betas, you can now sign-in to your account using Face ID or Touch ID.\nWhen you visit iCloud in Safari on a device running the iOS, iPadOS, or macOS betas, you\u2019ll see a new pop-up asking if you\u2019d like to sign-in using your Apple ID with biometrics. On a Face ID-equipped device, this means signing in with Face ID, while other devices, including Touch Bar-capable MacBook Pros, use Touch ID. The above screenshots show the Face ID sign-in process on an iPhone XS Max running the developer beta of iOS 13.\nWhen you visit iCloud.com on a device running the betas, you should automatically be redirected to beta.icloud.com. If you aren\u2019t, you can manually enter the URL in your address bar to try out this new feature. Either way, however, you must be running iOS 13, iPadOS 13, or macOS Catalina to use the new sign-in feature. It also doesn\u2019t require two-factor confirmation.\nThis is a pretty nifty new feature and is likely part of Apple\u2019s early efforts to test out Sign in with Apple. The company has previously said that it will make Sign in with Apple tools available to developer this summer, ahead of the feature\u2019s public launch in September.\nSigning in using Face ID and Touch ID on iCloud.com is a lot easier and more secure than manually entering your sign-in information. The process should be familiar to anyone that has signed in to the App Store or iTunes Store in the past.\nRead more about iOS 13 from 9to5Mac:",

        "body": "Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, and Eddy Cue, senior vice president of Internet Software and Services at Apple, attend the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, July 10, 2019 in Sun Valley, Idaho.\nApple may have lost the 5G battle to Qualcomm , but it's now in a position to win the war.\nApple said Thursday it will buy Intel's smartphone modem business, which includes several patents and about 2,000 Intel employees, for $1 billion. It's no secret Apple has been interested in developing its own modems for the iPhone, and buying up all that Intel IP puts it in a position to have one ready by the time its deal with Qualcomm runs out.\nApple had four bad options when it came to its 5G plans after it settled the royalty spat with Qualcomm in April:\nOption one: Settle with Qualcomm and get its 5G chips into iPhones by 2020.\nOption two: Wait for Intel to catch up with its 5G modems, which were said to be running behind schedule.\nOption three: Choose Huawei's 5G modems, which would be a tough sell in today's environment thanks to trade tensions and cybersecurity concerns.\nOption four: Make its own 5G chips, which would take several years and put Apple far behind other handset competitors that are already releasing 5G phones this year.\nSo Apple went with the least of all evils. It settled with Qualcomm and laid the groundwork for a long-term plan to develop its own modems. Meanwhile, Intel was forced to back out of its 5G modem plans once Apple and Qualcomm signed their deal, and its assets were relatively cheap and attractive for Apple to scoop up and get a head start on its own chips.",
