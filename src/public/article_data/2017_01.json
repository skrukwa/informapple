        "title": "Apple engineer about the original iPhone keynote: 'We were in the fifth row doing shots of Scotch after every segment of the demo. When the finale came and it worked, we all just drained the flask. It was the best demo we'd ever seen. We just spent the entire rest of the day drinking in the city.'",
        "body": "But even when Jobs stayed on the golden path, all manner of last-minute workarounds were required to make the iPhone functional. On announcement day, the software that ran Grignon\u2019s radios still had bugs. So, too, did the software that managed the iPhone\u2019s memory. And no one knew whether the extra electronics Jobs demanded the demo phones include would make these problems worse.\nJobs wanted the demo phones he would use onstage to have their screens mirrored on the big screen behind him. To show a gadget on a big screen, most companies just point a video camera at it, but that was unacceptable to Jobs. The audience would see his finger on the iPhone screen, which would mar the look of his presentation. So he had Apple engineers spend weeks fitting extra circuit boards and video cables onto the backs of the iPhones he would have onstage. The video cables were then connected to the projector, so that when Jobs touched the iPhone\u2019s calendar app icon, for example, his finger wouldn\u2019t appear, but the image on the big screen would respond to his finger\u2019s commands. The effect was magical. People in the audience felt as if they were holding an iPhone in their own hands. But making the setup work flawlessly, given the iPhone\u2019s other major problems, seemed hard to justify at the time.\nThe software in the iPhone\u2019s Wi-Fi radio was so unstable that Grignon and his team had to extend the phones\u2019 antennas by connecting them to wires running offstage so the wireless signal wouldn\u2019t have to travel as far. And audience members had to be prevented from getting on the frequency being used. \u201cEven if the base station\u2019s ID was hidden\u201d \u2014 that is, not showing up when laptops scanned for Wi-Fi signals \u2014 \u201cyou had 5,000 nerds in the audience,\u201d Grignon says. \u201cThey would have figured out how to hack into the signal.\u201d The solution, he says, was to tweak the AirPort software so that it seemed to be operating in Japan instead of the United States. Japanese Wi-Fi uses some frequencies that are not permitted in the U.S.\nThere was less they could do to make sure the phone calls Jobs planned to make from the stage went through. Grignon and his team could only ensure a good signal, and then pray. They had AT&T, the iPhone\u2019s wireless carrier, bring in a portable cell tower, so they knew reception would be strong. Then, with Jobs\u2019s approval, they preprogrammed the phone\u2019s display to always show five bars of signal strength regardless of its true strength. The chances of the radio\u2019s crashing during the few minutes that Jobs would use it to make a call were small, but the chances of its crashing at some point during the 90-minute presentation were high. \u201cIf the radio crashed and restarted, as we suspected it might, we didn\u2019t want people in the audience to see that,\u201d Grignon says. \u201cSo we just hard-coded it to always show five bars.\u201d\nNone of these kludges fixed the iPhone\u2019s biggest problem: it often ran out of memory and had to be restarted if made to do more than a handful of tasks at a time. Jobs had a number of demo units onstage with him to manage this problem. If memory ran low on one, he would switch to another while the first was restarted. But given how many demos Jobs planned, Grignon worried that there were far too many potential points of failure. If disaster didn\u2019t strike during one of the dozen demos, it was sure to happen during the grand finale, when Jobs planned to show all the iPhone\u2019s top features operating at the same time on the same phone. He\u2019d play some music, take a call, put it on hold and take another call, find and e-mail a photo to the second caller, look up something on the Internet for the first caller and then return to his music. \u201cMe and my guys were all so nervous about this,\u201d Grignon says. \u201cWe only had 128 megabytes of memory in those phones\u201d \u2014 maybe the equivalent of two dozen large digital photographs \u2014 \u201cand because they weren\u2019t finished, all these apps were still big and bloated.\u201d",

        "title": "What Apple gives you for $100 as a Safari Extension Developer \u2014 and why Reddit Enhancement Suite may cease support for Safari",
        "body": "What Apple gives you for $100 as a Safari Extension Developer \u2014 and why Reddit Enhancement Suite may cease support for Safari honestbleeps \u00b7 Follow \u00b7 Jan 2, 2017 6 min read -- 58 Listen Share\nThis post has been a long time coming, and is honestly months if not a year overdue.\nTL;DR (though I\u2019d prefer people read): it\u2019s a ton more work to support Safari than it is to support the rest of the browsers because of its various quirks. Despite that, Safari users make up a minuscule percentage of our users. Apple makes it even less appealing to keep doing all that extra work by not only charging $100 but having a horrendously mismanaged review process.\nFor the uninitiated, browser extensions are simple tools that enhance your web browsing experience in one way or another. Most of them add a button in your toolbar that performs some common function, or add some javascript and/or CSS to a page to enhance or modify the functionality and appearance of the page.\nI\u2019m the original creator of Reddit Enhancement Suite \u2014 an extension that makes functional changes to how Reddit works to, well, make time-wasting more efficient. While it started out only working on Firefox, it has since expanded to support Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge.\nMaintaining a browser extension that works in 5 browsers is no small task, especially with tech support requests coming from millions of users on different platforms. Doing it for free likely seems unfathomable to most people. But would you pay $100 per year just to do it?\nChanges from Apple\nA little over a year ago, Apple announced that Safari extension developers would no longer be able to develop extensions for free. Instead, they had to pay the same $100 per year that iOS and MacOS developers do. The benefit, they alleged, is that you\u2019d get the tools and support to develop iOS and MacOS apps in addition to Safari Extension development. According to them, this \u201csimplified\u201d their program.\nThe reality is that if your only interest is developing browser extensions, you now have to pay $100 for something that you could previously do for free, with no real usable benefit or improvement to the system. In fact, it became materially worse.\nIt\u2019s important to note that while you can still publish browser extensions without paying the $100 fee, you cannot have them listed on the Safari Extension Gallery, and they will not auto update when you release new versions. This last bit about auto updating makes it untenable for an extension as large as RES. Tech support is already hard for 5 different browsers on a myriad of operating systems \u2014 having thousands of Safari users on older versions of the extension because it won\u2019t auto update would make for a maintenance nightmare.\nA few important things to know about the Safari Extension Gallery, which Extension Developers have had to live with for the first year (see info on yet another change to the App Store later in this article):\nIt provides no way to charge for your extension, so while it costs $100 per year to publish your extension, there\u2019s no way for you to recoup that cost unless you\u2019re injecting ads into your extension or making money some other way\nIt\u2019s merely a listing on a webpage \u2014 every other browser\u2019s gallery actually provides detailed information (such as screen shots, etc) on the extension. Safari\u2019s gallery is just a page that essentially allows people to install the extension.\nApple\u2019s review process for extensions is disorganized, arduous and quite frankly insulting\nWe submitted Reddit Enhancement Suite multiple times, and it often took weeks to get a response \u2014 if we got one at all. Sometimes, we just never got any response, and RES never showed up in the gallery.\nThe first time RES was rejected, we waited several weeks only to be rejected for having no license to use the word \u201creddit\u201d, except we did have a license, so I responded to them and provided a copy of the license via email. I heard back a week later that we would be \u201cplaced back into review.\u201d\nWe waited a full two weeks from the initial rejection, only to be rejected again because it didn\u2019t contain a specific icon \u2014 a situation that would have been automatically and immediately detected by every other extension gallery, because they run a quick scan on the file uploaded to them during the submission process.\nAll of the browsers\u2019 extension galleries require that you submit your extension for review. Each of them, except Safari, has some automated processes to ensure you\u2019ve checked all the right boxes and included all the right files and data. The fact that we waited two weeks to be notified of such a simple omission, and one that wasn\u2019t noted in the first rejection, is pretty awful.\nSo, we submitted yet again, once again providing documentation of our license to use the term \u201creddit\u201d in the name, just in case. What happens? We wait a few weeks and are once again rejected for using the term \u201creddit\u201d in the name of our extension! I reply explaining the situation, and once again get a reply saying the extension will be \u201cplaced back into review.\u201d\nFrom the errant rejection, which happened October 9th, 2016, I waited 5 weeks until November 16th to email again asking what was up with the review process, because RES still wasn\u2019t published on the Safari Extension Gallery. I wrote Apple on November 16th asking what was going on with the review and reiterating that we had a license to use the term (attaching it in that email as well) \u2014 only to receive a response on November 18th saying \u201cYour extension, Reddit Enhancement Suite, is still undergoing review. You will receive an email update once the review has been completed.\u201d\nI never received an email.\nTurns out, however, Apple did eventually publish the extension \u2014 they just never told us. We don\u2019t know when it happened, but it was likely around or after Thanksgiving, because we\u2019d checked a few times since receiving that last email saying we were still under review.\nAll this for just $100 per year.\nMaintenance of Safari Extensions is also about to get even worse\nAll four of the other browsers use effectively the same APIs \u2014 Safari is potentially going to change that in some ugly ways.\nTo develop a Safari extension may eventually require Xcode, rather than whatever editor a developer prefers to use. Furthermore, it will no longer just be Javascript, CSS and HTML \u2014 it\u2019ll require the use of either Objective C or Swift for at least part of the application.\nThe work to convert a Safari extension is not monumental, but it\u2019s hardly trivial, especially if an extension makes frequent use of the \u201cglobal\u201d or \u201cbackground\u201d page.\nThe only plus side to this is that extension developers will publish on the Mac App Store, which would allow them to charge money and recoup that $100 per year fee. However, the downsides are many:\nThe $100 per year fee, which doesn\u2019t have to be paid to publish to any other browser.\nThe review process, as outlined above, is likely no better. There aren\u2019t a lot of happy stories about the Mac App Store review process.\nMaintaining a codebase for a cross-browser extension has become far less of a challenge over time between Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Edge \u2014 while Safari is now diverging further away, meaning significantly more overhead.\nThere is even less documentation around creating app extensions than there was around regular Safari browser extensions.\nConclusion\nFor the reasons outlined above, the Reddit Enhancement Suite dev team has to evaluate whether or not to continue supporting Safari. To do so will require spending another $100 to renew its license, and undergoing considerable work to convert the current extension to an App extension. That work includes not only the act of making the conversion, but also maintaining and testing it.\nIt will also mean additional work every time the team publishes, since Xcode will need to be used, which of course requires a Mac \u2014 not something every RES contributor has or can afford. This equates to a great number of additional hours for each release, not to mention more testing, etc.\nThe team essentially has two options:\nDiscontinue Safari support because it\u2019s not worth the effort outlined above (not to mention the extremely poor support from Apple)\nKeep working on Safari, at considerable expense in both time and some money, but charge for it on the app store to at least recoup the $100 and ideally make it worth the extra time and effort\nWe\u2019re not entirely sure what we\u2019ll do just yet, we\u2019re weighing these options because it\u2019s not an easy choice. We\u2019re certainly listening to the community\u2019s thoughts on this, but we\u2019re quite disappointed in Apple\u2019s treatment of Safari Extension Developers.",

        "title": "Consumer reports now recommends the MacBook Pro 2016",
        "body": "Consumer Reports has published new results for their MacBook Pro battery testing today after having previously given the system a Do Not Recommend rating. CR has officially changed their recommendations and can now recommend the new 2016 MacBook Pros. The new tests come after Apple and CR worked together to decide what went wrong during the original testing. After becoming aware of a Safari bug that may have impacted results, CR recently started retesting on a newer build of macOS Sierra in which the bug was supposedly fixed.\nThe original battery trials run by the Consumer Reports team had found that battery life was too varied in the system to recommend the machines. Apple stated that CR\u2019s testing did \u201cnot reflect real-world usage\u201d, and that because of the specific tests CR had run they uncovered an \u201cobscure and intermittent\u201d bug within Safari. Though CR\u2019s testing may not have been \u201creal-world usage,\u201d many 9to5Mac readers also reported lower than expected battery life as well.\nToday\u2019s recommendation change is a result of a macOS Sierra software update. Consumer Reports found that the update did in fact fix the problems they incurred in earlier testing. According to CR:\nWith the updated software, the three MacBook Pros in our labs all performed well, with one model running 18.75 hours on a charge. We tested each model multiple times using the new software, following the same protocol we apply to hundreds of laptops every year. Now that we\u2019ve factored in the new battery-life measurements, the laptops\u2019 overall scores have risen, and all three machines now fall well within the recommended range in Consumer Reports ratings.\nConsumer Reports went on to share their new results for the tested systems. On the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar they saw 15.75 hours of battery-life, for the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar they saw 18.75 hours, and for the 15-inch MacBook Pro they saw 17.25 hours.\nThat intermittent bug had supposedly been fixed in the recently released macOS Sierra 10.12.3 beta. Once installing the fix, Consumer Reports ran their disabled cache browser test again. In testing, CR disables browser cache to have the MacBook Pro load each site fresh every time it is reloaded. The idea according to CR is to \u201ccollect consistent results across the testing of many laptops, and it also puts batteries through a tougher workout.\u201d",

The result? Less eye strain, and a lot of orange-tinted Netflix. Then last year Apple added a feature called \"Night Shift\" to iOS, which mirrored this functionality, after shutting down a version of F.lux for iOS.\nWell, now Apple\u2019s Night Shift is coming to macOS. It just popped up in the latest 10.12.4 beta of Sierra, which is supposed to land alongside iOS 10.3. It's always a little sad to see an ingenious bit of software from a small upstart be copied by the Apple juggernaut (\"Sherlocking,\" as it's called, due to Apple's notorious creation of Sherlock in response to an existing search product called Watson). Still, I eventually uninstalled F.lux because it was a little buggy, and I found living with a blue screen preferable to having my screen flash between orange and blue on occasion.

NextMuni, used to predict arrival times of buses and trains, ran on AT&T's 2G network. Muni vehicles without upgraded systems installed don't show up on NextMuni, a problem that the San Francisco transit agency believes could take weeks to solve.\nAccording to AT&T, shutting down its 2G network frees up valuable spectrum for future network technologies, including 5G. AT&T says the spectrum will be repurposed for LTE.",

        "body": "(Also on Electrek)\nChris Lattner isn\u2019t the only high profile Apple executive who departed for Tesla over the past month, rather than sticking around to work on Titan. 9to5mac has learned that Matt Casebolt, a high profile Senior Director of Design for Apple\u2019s Mac lineup left the company last month for a role at Tesla as Sr. Director Engineering, Closures & Mechanisms. A job meant for a man named Casebolt \u2026\nOver the past two and a half years Casebolt led the development of the MacBook Pro with its standout and sometimes controversial Touch Bar feature. Before that, he led the team working on the iconic \u2018trash can\u2019 Mac Pro and was previously instrumental in the design of the first generations of MacBook Air. These are some of Apple\u2019s most iconic Mac products over the past decade.\nAt Tesla, Casebolt will be joining a growing hoard of Apple Alumni including former VP of Mac Hardware Engineering Doug Field who is the Sr. VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla. At Apple, where he was VP of Mac Hardware Engineering, Field may have crossed paths with Casebolt as well. In fact, the halls of Tesla are probably starting to feel like the good ol\u2019 days at Apple.\nMore recently, Tesla snagged Apple\u2019s Reliability Director to scale up production with iPhone-like dependability and the automaker\u2019s new Head of Communications was also poached from Apple\u2019s PR team. Casebolt and Lattner appear to be the latest examples of the so-called \u201cpoaching war\u201d between the automaker and the consumer electronic giant, which Tesla appears to be winning.\nThe departure follows reports of departures and downsizing in the wake of de-prioritization of the Macintosh groups at Apple.\nCasebolt is listed on at least 52 patents at Apple.",

To the surprise of many analysts, the company beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations by posting a record 78.3 million iPhone sales and $78.4 billion in revenue.\nHere are Q1 2017 numbers compared to figures from the same quarter in 2016.\nRevenue: $78.4 billion vs. $75.9 billion\n$78.4 billion vs. $75.9 billion iPhones: 78.3 million vs. 74.8 million, up 5%\n78.3 million vs. 74.8 million, up 5% iPads: 13.1 million vs. 16.1 million, down 19%\n13.1 million vs. 16.1 million, down 19% Macs: 5.37 million vs. 5.31 million, up 1%\nAnd here are some comments on the numbers from Tim Cook and Apple CFO Luca Maestri:\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple\u2019s highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cRevenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline.\u201d \u201cOur outstanding business performance resulted in a new all-time record for earnings per share, and over $27 billion in operating cash flow,\u201d said Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s CFO. \u201cWe returned nearly $15 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter, bringing cumulative payments through our capital return program to over $200 billion.\u201d\nOther interesting points from the earnings report include the revenue from \u201cOther Products,\u201d which includes Apple Watch and Beats headphone sales, was down 8% year-over-year in Q1, and revenue from China sales fell 12%. That\u2019s pretty big considering the country is Apple\u2019s 2nd largest market.\nApple will be starting its conference call shortly, so stay tuned for more highlights from their Q1 earnings.",

        "body": "Apple, Microsoft and Uber help staff stranded by Trump ban (update: Airbnb) The immigration order has serious consequences for the tech industry.\nPresident Trump's restrictions on immigration from Muslim-majority countries is affecting many, many more tech companies besides Google. Apple, Microsoft, Uber and others are rushing to accommodate employees who suddenly find themselves isolated by the new ban -- and in some cases, pressing for change at the highest levels. Apple, for instance, is both providing staff with support and \"reaching out\" to the White House to discuss the \"negative effect\" of the ban. Microsoft, meanwhile, says it's offering \"legal advice and assistance\" to workers. Uber, meanwhile, is discussing a very specific solution.\nIn a Facebook post, Uber chief Travis Kalanick stated that his company would identify affected drivers and \"compensate them pro bono\" during the next three months. They won't have to worry about \"putting food on the table\" in the meantime, he says. The ridesharing firm will offer more info in the days ahead.\nOn top of the practical considerations, tech companies are also voicing a concerted moral opposition to the immigration ban. Apple CEO Tim Cook is reminding staff that \"diversity makes us stronger,\" and that the company wouldn't exist without immigration -- Steve Jobs was the child of a Syrian immigrant, after all. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, meanwhile, decries the restrictions as both \"un-American\" and likely to increase the threat to Americans by fostering hate. Twitter's Jack Dorsey says that the human and financial effects of the order are \"real and upsetting.\" Mozilla is also chipping in with arguments that this both creates a \"barrier to innovation\" and hurts people who may face \"persecution, terror and war.\" Whatever you believe, it's safe to presume that the tech world won't be quiet about this issue any time soon.\nUpdate: Tesla founder Elon Musk (who, if you'll recall, is part of Trump's policy forum) has voiced his opposition to the immigration ban. He notes that this is \"not the best way\" to solve the country's problems, and that many people hurt by the restrictions are \"strong supporters of the US.\" It's a diplomatic comment, to be sure, but also a direct one.\nSubscribe to the Engadget Deals Newsletter Great deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget\u2019s editorial team.

        "body": "Apple is working on an enhanced version of Siri in time for the launch of the iPhone 8, indicate supply-chain sources cited by Digitimes. The sources suggest that Apple will respond to increased competition in the field of intelligent assistants \u2013 in particular, Google Assistant and the expansion of Amazon\u2019s Alexa to smartphones.\nGoogle has launched Google Pixel smartphones with Google Assistant and is expected to promote the adoption of the Google Assistant by other smartphone vendors, noted the sources, adding that Xiaomi has already adopted the Google Assistant [\u2026] Huawei pioneered the latest development trend by showcasing its Huawei Mate 9 featuring Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice services. Huawei, which currently ranks as the third largest smartphone vendor globally, is apparently trying to compete with Apple and Samsung for the number one title with the advanced feature, said the sources. LG reportedly is in talks with Amazon and Google for utilizing AI-based platforms developed by the two Internet service companies. In addition to using the Alexa on its smart household appliances, LG is also expected to integrate the Alexa into its new flagship smartphone, the LG G6, indicated the sources.\nWhile the report says that \u2018Apple\u2019s next-generation iPhone devices are likely to come with enhanced Siri,\u2019 it\u2019s of course more likely that this refers to an iOS update rather than anything specific to the new phone.\nApple bought the machine learning company Turi back in August, a team it later expanded to work on a variety of projects, including Siri. The company has also started reining back a little on the secrecy of its AI work in order to attract the best researchers.\nCompetition within the intelligent assistant field has increased with the popularity of the Amazon Echo and Google Home speakers. We recently discussed how Apple might best respond to this, be it simply making Siri better or making its own speaker too.\nPhoto: CNET",

The utility let anyone type in the IMEI or serial number of an iOS device to find out if Activation Lock had been turned off, handy to verify the authenticity of a seller when buying a used iPhone online.\nReferences to the web page have been removed from Apple\u2019s support documentation, indicating this is not a temporary issue and the page has been intentionally pulled from service \u2026\nThis Apple support document used to (see screenshot) recommend people check the Activation Lock status of a used iPhone, iPad or iPod touch before buying it to ensure the product will be ready for you to use. The text was removed on January 24th and the iCloud.com/activationlock URL stopped working sometime last night.\nAn alternative way to find out if an iOS device is Activation Locked without having the product in your possession is not given.\nIt isn\u2019t clear why Apple would take away such a useful utility. The ability to check if the device was still locked helped to prevent online sites from illegally selling stolen iPhones.\nFor a while, it was a common scam to put stolen iPhones on sites like eBay at a low price, turning a quick sale for the buyer to find that the device was effectively unusable as the Activation Lock was active.\nPreviously, prospective purchasers could ask the seller to provide the IMEI and/or the serial number and go to the Activation Lock website to check the status. If the tool reported was still locked, or if the seller refused to provide the serial numbers, it would indicate the device had indeed been stolen and the purchaser could cancel the sale.\nApple\u2019s online advice says to not \u2018take ownership of any used iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch until it has been removed from the previous owner\u2019s account\u2019. This simply isn\u2019t possible to verify now for online transactions, if the Activation Lock status tool does not return.\nActivation Lock has been enabled by default for iOS devices since iOS 8; it prevents anyone from activating a device without providing valid Apple ID credentials of the owner \u2014 dramatically cutting the value of stolen iOS devices on the black market.\nActivation Lock is available \u2014 and enabled by default \u2014 on all new iPhones, iPads, iPod touch devices and Apple Watch units. Users can disable Activation Lock on their own devices through the Find My iPhone app.\nUpdate: Many commenters have noted the following video in the last 48 hours, showing how Apple\u2019s tool was used maliciously.",

Kuo speculates the company will be forced to adopt desktop RAM due to restrictions of current memory system designs.\nApple took flak in releasing its latest MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models with a hard memory cap of 16GB, an minimal allotment viewed as a negative for imaging and video professionals. Responding to customer criticism, Apple said the move was made in a bid to maximize battery life.\nOn more than one occasion, SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller defended the decision to limit RAM allotments to 16GB, saying higher amounts would require a power-hungry memory controller unsuitable for use in portable machines.\n\"The MacBook Pro uses 16GB of very fast LPDDR memory, up to 2133MHz,\" Schiller said in November. \"To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life.\"\nEssentially, the Intel Skylake CPUs used in Apple's MacBook Pro only support up to 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM at 2133MHz. Though Intel does make processors capable of addressing more than 16GB of memory, those particular chipsets rely on less efficient DDR4 RAM and are usually deployed in desktops with access to dedicated mains power.\nIn order to achieve high memory allotments and keep unplugged battery life performance on par with existing MacBook Pro models, Apple will need to move to an emerging memory technology like LPDDR4 or DDR4L. Such hardware is on track for release later this year.\nBeyond the high-end 15-inch model, Kuo expects Apple to start production of new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros in the third quarter of 2017.\nAs for the 12-inch MacBook, Kuo believes next-generation versions of the thin-and-light will enter mass production in the second quarter with the same basic design aesthetic introduced in 2015. New for 2017 is a 16GB memory option that will make an appearance thanks to Intel's new processor class.\nDebuted in 2015, the MacBook thin-and-light has for its short lifetime maxed out at 8GB of RAM, limiting its utility as a professional machine.\nOn MacBook sales, Kuo blames unforeseen production delays for Apple's poor year-over-year performance in 2016. Recent statistics from market research firm Gartner showed Mac shipments slump 8.7 percent for the year, the worst result from a top-five PC vendor.\nAccording to Kuo, Apple has rectified supply chain bottlenecks and is on scheduled to return Mac to growth in 2017. Further, channel checks reveal replacement demand for MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is better than expected despite carrying a hefty price premium, the analyst says. To keep up with demand, capacity has been expanded by 50 percent.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nApple on Friday filed a lawsuit against longtime iPhone modem supplier Qualcomm, in a dispute over royalty payments apparently connected to a federal investigation into the chipmaker's potentially anticompetitive business dealings.\nApple's complaint comes just a few days after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission also filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, accusing the company of forcing Apple to buy wireless chips in exchange for better royalties. Apple reportedly sought to lower its patent royalty payments to Qualcomm, but the chipmaker made it conditional that the iPhone maker exclusively use Qualcomm chips from 2011 until 2016.\nNow Apple has added to the attack on Qualcomm with its own lawsuit, accusing its partner of withholding nearly $1 billion in payments, according to CNBC. In the complaint, Apple claims the $1 billion spat was \"retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies,\" referring to the FTC complaint against Qualcomm.\n\"Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined,\" Apple's complaint reads.\nAfter the exclusivity agreement with Qualcomm ended in 2016, Apple began diversifying its modem suppliers last year with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The company's latest flagship handsets use modems from both Qualcomm and Intel.\nThe FTC has been investigating Qualcomm since 2014, concerned that it was abusing FRAND (fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory) patent commitments with clients. Apple remains one of the company's more important customers, despite the iPhone 7's shift towards multiple modem suppliers.",

        "title": "Mac sales declined nearly 10% last year as Lenovo, Dell and others gained ground",
        "body": "It\u2019s not surprising that Mac sales dropped for Apple in 2016 as they experienced their first year over year sales decline since 2001. What is interesting, however, is that as Mac sales dropped roughly 10% and personal computers overall dropped 5.7% for the year, the top four leaders in the market all saw growth as Apple was pushed to number five.\nAlthough Mac sales were up in Q4 2016 compared to Q4 2015, an analyst note today from Bloomberg\u2019s Anand Srinivasan and Wei Mok has revealed Apple has dropped to the fifth largest PC vendor, with ASUS (ASUSTeK) overtaking fourth place. The top four vendors are now Lenovo, HP, Dell, and ASUS.\nWhile the top four vendors all saw growth in large part due to Apple\u2019s weak year, Dell saw the most growth at just over 10%.\nThose four companies represent 65.2% of the overall market and each grew year- over-year, while Apple ceded ground, declining 30 bps to 7.1%. The other 27.7% of the market is comprised of more than 200 vendors. In a market expected to consolidate, Samsung and Fujitsu are reported to be in discussions to sell their PC businesses to Lenovo.\nAlthough they have a smaller share of the hardware market, Microsoft has recently been touting that Mac users are switching to the Surface in greater numbers than ever before. Microsoft is included in the \u2018Others\u2019 category in the graph above.\nWe\u2019ve yet to see how much the release of Apple\u2019s new MacBook Pros will affect their 2017 Q1 Mac sales, but Srinivasan and Mok suggest that Apple needs to leverage new markets with their high priced computers to continue growth. A growing middle class in China may help spur growth for Apple Macs. Apple\u2019s iMacs and MacBooks are in the high price-range relative to other PCs. The company has historically benefited from consumers in the U.S. and developed countries in Europe, which represent 63% of its market. As the PC market matures, Apple needs to explore new markets, and China represents a potential growth opportunity. Shipments of Apple Macs in China rose 35% in 2014 and 22% in 2015. We recently took a look at what may be in store for Mac updates this year, and Tim Cook has told desktop Mac fans not to worry after a year without a desktop hardware refresh: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a ton of things on our roadmap that I can\u2019t talk about, but that I\u2019m incredibly excited about.\u201d",

        "body": "While it has always been known that Apple considered a variety of ideas when they were deciding to enter the mobile phone market (with ex employees discussing it behind closed doors, as seen in this Cult Of Mac article, not much was known about alternate versions of the iPhone until now.\nMuch like the first production iPhone, the prototype features many of the same features including an aluminium chassis, multi-touch compatible screen, 2G connectivity and WiFi radios. However, despite carrying a similar design, the phone itself is extremely different from the iPhone we know today.\nInstead of the modern touch-driven interface we now call iOS, it featured an operating system dubbed \u201cAcorn OS\u201d (this was an internal code name, and it unclear if it would have kept that name if it had been released), which is derived from the acorn shown on boot. It presents an on-screen click wheel, which took up the bottom portion of the screen, and on the other half of the screen, a UI identical to the one found on the beloved iPod, with options such as \u201cDial\u201d, \u201cSMS\u201d, \u201cMusic\u201d, \u201cContacts\u201d and \u201cRecents\u201d, however lacking a browser option. The interface is interacted with in the same way an iPod would be operated.\nNot much else is known about the device, apart from the fact that it differs heavily from the iPhone we know today, and that very few units running \u201cAcorn OS\u201d exist, with most of them likely being destroyed by Apple, a company in which there is a specific job role in relation to the destruction of prototypes.\nWhile many could attempt to doubt the authenticity of such a device, there is clear proof its existence found in one of Apple\u2019s patents, International Application No:PCT/US2006/008349. Filed in 2006, after the iPod, and before the iPhone, the drawings referenced in the patent, show a \u201cmulti touch device\u201d, which features a click wheel in FIG 11.\nOne could hope that a unit ends up in the hands of a museum one day, as smartphones today and going forward would most likely look very different than such a device.\nWhile Apple clearly made the right choice by choosing to base the iPhone strictly on touch, and turning it into a portable connected device with full web access (arguably one of its biggest and boldest features), it\u2019s nevertheless fascinating to see the many ideas that were considered leading up to the iPhone that we all know today.",

        "title": "Apple Expected to Return to Growth With Biggest Earnings Ever Today",
        "body": "Apple is scheduled to report its earnings results for the first quarter of the 2017 fiscal year at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time today, revealing how much money it made between September 25 and December 31 of last year. The holiday shopping season typically makes this quarter Apple's most lucrative of the year.\nApple benefitted from an extra week of sales in the quarter\u201414 versus the usual 13\u2014due to a step it takes every 5 years or so to realign its September-ending fiscal quarter with the typical December-ending calendar quarter. Given the week fell between Christmas and the New Year, the seven extra days of sales could be significant.\nApple's official guidance calls for revenue of between $76 billion and $78 billion, which would be its highest revenue in a single quarter ever\u2014topping its current record of $75.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. Apple also expects gross margin between 38% and 38.5%, compared to 40.1% in the year-ago quarter.\nThe average expectation among Wall Street analysts is that Apple will report revenue around the $77 billion mark, or roughly the midpoint of Apple's guidance. Herein is a list of some of those predictions, ordered from lowest to highest, based on compiled averages and research notes obtained by MacRumors:\n\u2022 Mark Moskowitz of Barclays: $76.6 billion\n\u2022 Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company: $76.68 billion\n\u2022 Steven Milunovich of UBS: $76.8 billion\n\u2022 Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets: $76.9 billion\n\u2022 Rod Hall of J.P. Morgan: $76.9 billion\n\u2022 Bloomberg News compiled average: $77 billion\n\u2022 Yahoo Finance compiled average: $77.38 billion\n\u2022 Reuters compiled average: $77.4 billion\n\u2022 Brian White of Drexel Hamilton: $77.61 billion\n\u2022 Neil Cybart of Above Avalon: $80 billion\nThe record-breaking revenue would put an end to Apple's past three consecutive quarters of declining revenue on a year-over-year basis, which resulted in the company's first annual revenue decline since 2001. Prior to 2016, Apple had an impressive streak of 51 consecutive quarters of uninterrupted sales growth.\nWhile iPhone sales dropped for the first time ever last year, the smartphone is still Apple's most important product by far\u2014it accounted for 60% of the company's revenue last quarter. The consensus among analysts is that Apple will have sold around 76 million iPhones, up slightly from 74.8 million in the year-ago quarter.\nMost analysts believe a higher ratio of customers purchased a Plus-sized iPhone this launch, with the dual-lens camera in particular enticing customers to choose the 5.5-inch model over the smaller iPhone 7.\nAbove Avalon analyst Neil Cybart estimates Apple sold 5.6 million Macs in the quarter, a 5% increase over the 5.3 million it sold in the year-ago period. The quarter was highlighted by the launch of long-awaited MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models in late October, which likely inflated sales.\niPad sales may remain on a longstanding downward trend based on units, but more expensive iPad Pro models have led to higher average selling prices and increased revenue for Apple's tablet business.\nCybart expects revenue from Apple's growing services category to rise to $6.7 billion, a 22% increase over the $6.1 billion it reported in the year-ago quarter. These earnings are derived from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud storage subscriptions, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing, and other services.\nInvestors will be looking closely at \"Other Products\" to measure the impact that Apple Watch Series 2 models and AirPods have on the category's revenue, which Cybart forecasts will rise 9% year-over-year. The category also includes sales of the Apple TV, Beats products, iPods, and many accessories.\nCybart expects Apple's guidance will point towards continued growth next quarter, suggesting the 2017 fiscal year will remain on an upward trend.\nMacRumors will be providing live coverage of Apple's earnings results conference call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.",

I mean, why deal with headaches? But OK, if for whatever reason you would rather use macOS or a Linux-based operating system like Ubuntu, there is a solution -- Wine. This is a compatibility layer that can be used to run Windows software on other operating systems. With that said, it is not perfect -- it can be a frustrating experience.\n\"This release represents over a year of development effort and around 6,600 individual changes. The main highlights are the support for Microsoft Office 2013, and the 64-bit support on macOS. It also contains a lot of improvements across the board, as well as support for many new applications and games,\" says The Wine team.\nThe team further explains, \"This is the first release made on the new time-based, annual release schedule. This implies that some features that are being worked on but couldn't be finished in time have been deferred to the next development cycle. This includes in particular the Direct3D command stream, the full HID support, the Android graphics driver, and message-mode pipes.\"\nALSO READ: Worried about your online privacy?

        "title": "Next iPhone Said to Have Even Better IP68-Rated Water Resistance",
        "body": "Apple's next-generation iPhone will feature IP68-rated water resistance, which would be an improvement over the IP67-certified iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to The Korea Herald. Samsung's Galaxy S7 is IP68 certified, and the Galaxy S8 is naturally rumored to be as well.\nIn the IP68 rating, the \"6\" means the next iPhone would remain effectively dustproof, with \"no ingress of dust\" and \"complete protection against contact,\" while the \"8\" means the device will be even more water resistant. The Galaxy S7 is able to withstand 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes.\nFor comparison, IP67-rated devices like the iPhone 7 offer the same protection against dust but only have water damage protection against immersion between 15 centimeters and 1 meter by definition. However, while keeping your device dry is best, tests have shown the iPhone 7 is typically more water resistant than advertised.\nApple describes the iPhone 7 as \"splash and water resistant,\" but its fine print warns that \"splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear.\" Despite having an IP67 rating, liquid damage is still not covered under Apple's warranty.",

        "title": "Apple to forge 'iPhone 8' chassis from stainless steel",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nA rumor out of East Asia on Tuesday suggests Apple might ditch aluminum for forged stainless steel in crafting its next-generation iPhone, lending credence to predictions of an \"iPhone 8\" with \"glass sandwich\" design.\nCiting Taiwanese sources, hit-or-miss publication DigiTimes reports Apple has bypassed usual supplier Foxconn and placed orders for forged stainless steel iPhone casings from manufacturing partner Jabil.\nApple's last iPhone to rely on stainless steel was the iPhone 4s, which wrapped two CNC-machined bands made from a bespoke steel alloy around a \"glass-sandwich\" body. Since the iPhone 5 series, however, Apple has favored aluminum as the metal of choice for iPhone. The lightweight yet durable alloy is a Cupertino favorite used to manufacture everything from iPhone 7 and 7s to Apple Watch to Mac.\nAfter the iPhone 6 \"bend-gate\" fiasco in 2014, which claimed the handset could be easily deformed, Apple switched to 7000-series aluminum first applied in the original Apple Watch.\nWhile Apple is rumored to return to steel with the \"iPhone 8\" chassis, the fabrication process will be notably different from that of iPhone 4 and 4s. In particular, the company is said to be using a metal forging method instead of common billet milling.\nForging is a machining method that essentially squeezes a metal alloy between two halves of a mold \u2014 tool and die \u2014 to form a finished part. Compared to components crafted using subtractive machining methods like CNC, forged blanks provide superlative structural rigidity and can in some cases afford greater latitude in the design process.\nConsidering Apple's penchant for finely finished products, and the need for details like internal screw threads and anchor points, it is likely that CNC tooling will play at least a small role in construction.\nMac Otakara noted the potential move to stainless steel earlier today.\nToday's rumor is consistent with reports suggesting a next-generation handset will adopt a substantially glass design when it debuts later this year. Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo first revealed Apple's plans for a glass-backed iPhone last April, since expanding the prediction to include exotic technologies like an OLED display, wireless charging, an invisible home button and more.",
