        "title": "Facebook drains battery in background even though background refresh turned off by using auto-play to keep the app active without you knowing.",
        "body": "Many iOS users report that the Facebook app uses an extraordinary amount of resources when it\u2019s in the background. Apparently, the drain is even more pronounced when Background App Refresh is switched \u2018off\u2019 for the Facebook app. This is because Facebook is actively creating channels to continue refreshing their app in the background when the user has explicitly stated that they do not want it to.\nAs Federico Viticci from MacStories puts it into words, \u201cThe fact that a company the size of Facebook can\u2019t optimize energy consumption of their iOS app is simply ridiculous. If they can but don\u2019t want to, well, that\u2019s even worse\u201d. He even recommends iOS users not to install the Facebook app, and instead access Facebook from Safari. And by the help of iOS 9\u2019s improved energy consumption stats, he seems to have figured out one of the various tricks Facebook is employing to stay active in the background and drain battery.\n\u201cOn my girlfriend\u2019s iPhone, for instance, iOS 9 reports 5 hours of on-screen usage for the last 7 days, and another 11 hours of background audio usage with Background App Refresh turned off. My guess is that Facebook is hijacking audio sessions on iOS by keeping silent audio in the background whenever a video plays in the app. And because, by default, videos on Facebook auto-play on both Wi-Fi and Cellular and few people ever bother to turn it off, that means there\u2019s a high chance the Facebook app will always find a way to play a video, keep audio in the background, and consume energy to perform background tasks\u201d.\nShouldn\u2019t Apple consider additional battery controls to take action against shady practices like invisible background audio used by Facebook for iOS?",

        "body": "Apple's cash stash? Oh, only $206,000,000,000\nShow Caption Hide Caption Apple - 48 million iPhones sold Apple sold nearly 50 million iPhones in the fiscal 4th quarter, reports Jefferson Graham on #TalkingTech. By Jefferson Graham\nApple has a good problem. It can't get rid of its cash fast enough.\nThe digital gadget maker's cash and investments during the quarter jumped to $206 billion \u2014 a staggering 33% increase from the same period a year ago. The swelling pile of cash underscores why selling $650 phones in this day and age continues to be an enviable business model.\nApple would have enough cash to give every American $646 apiece - which is remarkably close to the retail price of an iPhone.\nThanks to strong sales of the iPhone, the company reported a quarterly adjusted profit of $1.96 a share, beating estimates calling for a profit of $1.87 a share. Apple's numbers even topped the unofficial hopes of investors polled by Estimize, looking for a profit of $1.92 a share.\nApple's cash continues to mount - even though it keeps trying to get rid of it. The company returned $17 billion to investors during the quarter in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. Apple has now paid out $143 billion of the $200 billion it said it would give to investors.\nThe iPhone might be tech's version of an ATM machine, but several newer Apple products aren't pulling their weight. The iPad continues to plummet - with unit sales in the quarter dropping 20%. Apple Pay adoption remains low and the watch doesn't appear to be even a rounding error in the company's revenue.\nBut Apple's cash just keeps piling up as consumers seem willing to keep opening their wallets for phones.\nMatt Krantz on Twitter: @mattkrantz.",

        "body": "Both Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto can turn regular vehicles into connected cars, but according to Porsche, one has a distinct advantage over the other. Motor Trend reports that the German car manufacturer went with Apple's infotainment system over Google's in its new 911 Carrera and 911 Carrera S because the Android Auto agreement demanded too much data be sent to the search giant.\nCarPlay only checks if the vehicle is moving\nThe publication says that Android Auto tracks variables including vehicle speed, throttle position, fluid temperatures, and engine revs, information that is collated and then sent back to Google. Apple's CarPlay, on the other hand, only checks with the car's powertrain control module to ensure that the vehicle is moving. Porsche was apparently unwilling to enter a deal that would send reams of information back to Google \u2014 partly, Motor Trend says, because the manufacturer thinks those details make its high-end autos special, and partly because Google itself is in the midst of building its own car.\nIt's not clear whether the agreement Motor Trend cites is standard for all carmakers or was offered specifically to Porsche, but it will raise questions about the amount of information sent back by vehicles that do use Android Auto, and what exactly Google is doing with that data. Porsche's decision is certainly restrictive for Android owners, but let's be honest \u2014 if you're planning to buy a brand new Porsche 911 Carrera S, you're probably in a position to be able to afford an iPhone in addition to your existing handset.\nUpdate, 3:19 p.m.: Google has denied the substance of the Motor Trend report.",

        "body": "Microsoft has just announced its first ever laptop, and it\u2019s called the Surface Book.\nUnveiled at the company\u2019s product launch event today, the Surface Book was described as \u201cthe ultimate laptop\u201d by Panos Panay, Microsoft\u2019s Surface and Lumia VP.\nThe notebook has a 13.5-inch PixelSense screen \u2013 that\u2019s the same display technology featured on the new Microsoft Surface Pro 4 \u2013 with a 3,000 x 2,000 pixel resolution, a 3:2 aspect ratio, and 10-point multi-touch.\nThe display has an impressive pixel density of 267-pixels-per-inch, which works out at about 6 million pixels.\nIn terms of performance, you\u2019re looking at serious graphical potential courtesy of an optional dedicated Nvidia GeForce GPU, as well as integrated Intel HD 520 graphics. It\u2019s also got 1GB of dedicated high-speed GDDR5 RAM and new Skylake i5/i7 processor options.\nMemory options available are 8GB or 16GB, while SSD storage is offered in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB variants.\nPanay also claimed that the processor and dedicated GPU \u2018fundamentally\nmakes Surface Book two times faster than the MacBook Pro\u2019 .\nWith any portable device, battery life is a concern. Fortunately, it sounds respectable enough, with Panay claiming a solid 12-hour charge cycle with video playback \u2013 we\u2019ll have to wait for a review unit to verify this.\nThe trackpad is built from glass and offers five points of multi-touch. The keys are backlit, and have a neglible 1.6mm travel distance. Oh, and the keyboard is detachable \u2013 not bad for a powerhouse notebook.\nThat last bit is where it all gets interesting, because the Nvidia GPU is actually built into the dock. So you won\u2019t get high-grade graphics performance unless the keyboard is attached.\nRelated: Five things things that will make you want a Surface Book\nDevice dimensions of the laptop are 232.1 x 312.3 x 13.0-22.8mm, while tablet dimensions are 220.2 x 312.3 x 7.7mm.\nThe laptop sans the Nvidia GPU weighs 1.515kg, rising to 1.579kg with the GPU. As a tablet only, the Surface Book weighs 726g.\nOn the camera front, you\u2019re looking at an 8-megapixel rear-facing sensor, and a 5-megapixel front-facing selfie snapper.\nThere are dual microphones \u2013 front- and rear-facing \u2013 as well as frong-facing stereo speakers equipped with Dolby audio.\nThe Surface Book also works with Microsoft\u2019s new Surface Pen, which comes in five colour options and offers up a range of interchangeable tips for varying use-cases.\nIn terms of connectivity, there are two full-size USB 3.0 ports, an SD card reader, Surface Connect for power and docking, a 3.5mm audio jack, a Mini DisplayPort, Bluetooth 4.0, and 802.11ac 2\u00d72 MIMO Wi-FI support.\nRelated: Windows 10 features guide\nThe Surface Book starts at a price of $1,499, and is available to pre-order starting October 7. It\u2019s available to buy outright on October 26.\nWhat do you think of the Microsoft Surface Book?

        "body": "The processors upgrades mean that the higher-end iMac models also include Iris Pro graphics, which should be particularly useful for pushing around the 4K machine's extra pixels. RAM has also been improved across the board from 8GB of 1600MHz LPDDR3 to 8GB of 1867GHz LPDDR3, upgradeable to 16GB. This update also adds Thunderbolt 2 and a larger storage option.\nThe design hasn't changed, but 4K makes it much nicer to look at\nWhile Apple has changed basically all of the key features on the inside, the iMac's external hardware is the same as it has been. It's still impressively slim and stylish. The black bezels around the display are starting to feel large when compared to, say, the MacBook, but they aren't really something you notice when there's a large 4K screen taking up most of your vision.\nThat said, there will be a few visual differences around the new iMac: Apple is updating its standalone keyboard, trackpad, and mouse, with the former two getting design overhauls. The keyboard and mouse come with the iMac by default, and you'll be able to opt for the (much more expensive) new trackpad.\nJust like Apple only brought 5K to its top-of-the-line 27-inch iMac last year, the company is only offering 4K as an option on its most expensive 21.5-inch machine. It'll start at $1,499, while 1080p models will continue to start at $1,099. It's a big jump, but there's also a big power and quality difference between the two tiers. In a brief test of the 4K model, the actual performance seemed like nothing to write home about \u2014 the display, however, should be enough to distract you during any unexpected load times. All models are shipping today.\nPhotography by Sean O'Kane.",

        "title": "Apple removing hundreds of App Store apps as advertising SDK found to collect sensitive user data via private APIs",
        "body": "Code analytics platform SourceDNA has found hundreds of apps on the App Store that used private APIs to collect private user data, like email addresses and device identifiers, slipping under Apple\u2019s radar in the approval process. The code got into these apps through the inclusion of a mischievous third-party advertising SDK, which secretly stored this data and sent it off to its own servers.\nApple has now verified the SourceDNA report and is removing all of the apps that included the advertising SDK from the store, as using private API calls is a breach of App Review Guidelines. Apple has also patched its approval processes to prevent any more apps that use this technique to make it onto the App Store.\nThe SDK under examination comes from a Chinese advertising company, Youmi. SourceDNA used its own binary search tools to find 256 apps that included the unscrupulous SDK, which have received over a million downloads in total.\nThe SDK used a variety of techniques and APIs to collect identifying personal information it shouldn\u2019t normally be able to. This includes serial numbers, peripheral serial numbers, lists of installed apps and obtaining the user\u2019s Apple ID email. The analytics company speculates Youmi became more confident with its methods over time, slowly adding more and more data collection code over a two-year span.\nIn this instance, almost all of the offending apps were targeted at the Chinese market. However, given that evasion of Apple\u2019s app review process has been going on for many months, SourceDNA is concerned that there may be other cases of similar bad behavior already on the App Store, as yet undetected.\nThis is Apple\u2019s full statement on the matter.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified a group of apps that are using a third-party advertising SDK, developed by Youmi, a mobile advertising provider, that uses private APIs to gather private information, such as user email addresses and device identifiers, and route data to its company server. This is a violation of our security and privacy guidelines. The apps using Youmi\u2019s SDK have been removed from the App Store and any new apps submitted to the App Store using this SDK will be rejected. We are working closely with developers to help them get updated versions of their apps that are safe for customers and in compliance with our guidelines back in the App Store quickly.\u201d",

The license/registration file in /Library/Preferences was corrupted, which, for some reason, breaks the sign-in UI.From talking to the support staff, this is apparently a widespread issue, and for some reason, their accepted solution is to make a new user account which is sorta overkill considering it's a single file causing the issue.Schwieb, is there a way you could forward these instructions to the support staff? Deleting the problematic file is a much simpler, more palatable solution. I'll frowny face these instructions as well.Edit: The file in question is the Office 2011 license file. Deleting it fixes 2016 licensing, but 2011 gives a warning \"The Office for Mac installation did not complete successfully because there was a problem with the installer.\" I'm guessing there is a line of code somewhere in Office 2016 that points to the old license file location (the new license file location is /Library/LaunchDaemons).I would like to reiterate how unreasonable being told to create a new user account is, regardless of whether or not it makes the problem go away, especially when it's a bug in the product. The proper response to being told to create a new user account is \"no, fuck you!\"",

        "title": "Writer Mark Twain excitedly bought a state-of-the-art typewriter in 1904 for $125, which, adjusted for inflation, is the cost of a top iMac today, $2600. Interesting how top personal tech stayed at this price level.",
        "body": "From the still-excellent Letters of Note, a scan of Mark Twain's first correspondence typed on the Remington typewriter he bought in 1874. The note, written to his brother, expressed Twain's hope that the machine would allow him to write more quickly in the near future.\nI love that the first line is just a bunch of gibberish \u2014 \"BJUYT KIOP N LKJHGFDSA:QWERTYUIOP:_-98VX5432QW RT\". Twain (or his two-year-old daughter Susie) likely was just testing out the keys and instead of wasting the paper, started his correspondence below.\nIn a dictation taken in 1904, Twain recalled seeing and then buying the typewriter.\nNasby and I saw the machine through a window, and went in to look at it. The salesman explained it to us, showed us samples of its work, and said it could do fifty-seven words a minute \u2014 a statement which we frankly confessed that we did not believe. So he put his type-girl to work, and we timed her by the watch. She actually did the fifty-seven in sixty seconds. We were partly convinced, but said it probably couldn't happen again. But it did. We timed the girl over and over again \u2014 with the same result always: she won out. She did her work on narrow slips of paper, and we pocketed them as fast as she turned them out, to show as curiosities. The price of the machine was $125. I bought one, and we went away very much excited. At the hotel we got out our slips and were a little disappointed to find that they all contained the same words. The girl had economized time and labor by using a formula which she knew by heart. However, we argued \u2014 safely enough \u2014 that the first type-girl must naturally take rank with the first billiard-player: neither of them could be expected to get out of the game any more than a third or a half of what was in it. If the machine survived \u2014 if it survived \u2014 experts would come to the front, by-and-by, who would double this girl's output without a doubt. They would do a hundred words a minute \u2014 my talking-speed on the platform. That score has long ago been beaten.\nUpdate: In the letter, Twain states he paid $125 for the typewriter, which, according to this inflation calculator, is about $2600 in 2014 dollars, or a couple hundred dollars more than the starting price of the 27-inch 5K iMac. I would love to see the first letter written by Twain on one of those. (via @spsheridan)",

        "body": "Apple has more than $205bn of cash in the bank, the company revealed on Tuesday as its chief executive Tim Cook said the firm had made more than $234bn in 2015, making it its \u201cmost successful year ever\u201d.\nThe California company now has more money in the bank than the Czech Republic, Peru and New Zealand make in gross domestic product (GDP) a year, according to World Bank statistics. Apple\u2019s cash balances increased by $2.8bn in the last three months alone.\nApple sold 48m iPhones worth $33.2bn in its latest quarter \u2013 an increase of 36% on the same period last year and more than the total sales achieved by both Microsoft and Facebook over the same period.\nIts quarterly profit came in at $11.1bn, 31% more than in the fourth quarter of 2014. Sales were up 22% in the three months to 28 September to $51.5bn.\n\u201cToday we\u2019re reporting a very strong finish to a record-breaking year, \u201d Cook said. \u201cWe are heading into the holidays with our strongest product lineup yet.\u201d\nApple, which is already the world\u2019s most valuable company, worth $657bn, said predicted sales would increase further to between $75.5 and $77.5bn in its current quarter as only the first weekend of new iPhone 6S sales were captured in the previous three months.\n\u201cWe think we can grow iPhone (sales) during the December quarter,\u201d chief financial officer Luca Maestri said. The average iPhone now sells for $670, an increase of $67 on the previous quarter.\nSales in China doubled compared to the same period last year, to $12.5bn, and some analysts predict that China could overtake the US to become Apple\u2019s biggest market.\nWhile the iPhone continues to soar, iPad sales dropped for the seventh consecutive quarter and were down 20% compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. The company did not state how many Apple Watches it has sold.\nApple\u2019s shares, which have fallen by about 15% from a peak of $133 in July, increased by 0.6% to $114.5o in after-hours trading in New York on Tuesday.",

        "title": "Apple Reiterates Inability to Unlock iOS Devices Running iOS 8 or Higher in New Court Filing",
        "body": "Apple this week informed a federal magistrate judge in Brooklyn, New York that it \"would be impossible\" for the company to access data on a locked iPhone running iOS 8 or later, reports Reuters. Apple was responding to a request from the judge, James Orenstein, to help him decide whether to fulfill a U.S. Justice Department request that would have forced Apple to help authorities gain access to a seized iPhone.\nApple's response is not a surprise, as it is the same thing the company has said several times in the past. Since iOS 8, Apple has stopped storing encryption keys for devices, making it impossible for the company to unlock iPhones and iPads under police request. Without an encryption key, Apple cannot bypass a passcode to gain access to an iOS device.\nIn a brief filed with the court, Apple said 90 percent of its devices are running iOS 8 or higher and are thus inaccessible. Apple is able to access the 10 percent of devices that continue to use iOS 7 or below, but the company told the judge that being forced to comply with the Justice Department's request could tarnish its brand.\n\"Forcing Apple to extract data in this case, absent clear legal authority to do so, could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand,\" Apple's lawyers wrote.\nApple's encryption changes, implemented in 2014 with iOS 8, have been unpopular with some law enforcement officials. FBI Director James Comey has expressed concern that encryption implemented by companies like Google and Apple lets people \"place themselves above the law.\"\nJust yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer encryption is a necessity and that software backdoors are unacceptable, reiterating Apple's long-standing opinion on the subject.",

        "body": "When Apple CEO Tim Cook repeatedly says that the iPhone 6 and then iPhone 6s are converting more Android users to iOS, many would wonder what that means and whether Apple is embellishing the numbers. \u201c\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\u201cWe recorded the highest rate on record for Android switchers last quarter at 30 percent,\u201d Cook said earlier this week after Apple had announced it sold more than 48 million iPhones during the period.\nBut it turns out there\u2019s actually one way to measure whether there\u2019s real interest in switching to iPhone and we need to look no further than the Google Play Store for proof.\nDON\u2019T MISS: MIT scientists can see through walls and identify people with new wireless device\nBecause of the way the Google Play Store is built \u2013 or better said, because Google made it that way, to highlight the performance of apps \u2013 each app has an estimated number of app downloads. That\u2019s something you don\u2019t see in the App Store for any app.\nThanks to this feature, we\u2019ve learned that popular mobile apps including Gmail and Facebook have passed 1 billion downloads on Android devices. Assuming that each download is unique, that means there are more than 1 billion Android devices in use, something Google confirmed a bunch of times. In fact, that number is now at 1.4 billon according to Google\u2019s most recent estimate.\nEnter Move to iOS, Apple\u2019s first Android app. The app was launched right around the iPhone 6s\u2019 release and hardcore Android fans made sure to bomb it with crippling 1-star reviews. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the app is not useful and that Android users don\u2019t use it to move their data to iPhone.\nThe app\u2019s specific purpose is to save your pictures, messages, contacts, bookmarks and Google data and then move it to the iPhone you just purchased. You won\u2019t use it more than once on the same Android device. After all, you\u2019re switching to iPhone. So that means that, no matter what reviews say, some of the savvy Android switchers will use it to move their data to iOS \u2013 unless they use their data backup systems.\nThat said, on October 29th, Google\u2019s stats indicate that the Move to iOS app has been downloaded between 1 million and 5 million times (image above). As I just explained, these are likely unique installs for a one-time kind of usage. Now, I\u2019ll note that on Wednesday afternoon the number was at between 500,000 and 1 million installs. That means, since yesterday, the number of installs moved past the 1 million mark.\nObviously, not all Android users who switch to iPhone install the app and not everyone who installs the app actually switches to the iPhone. But this is still a clear indication that plenty of people are interested in the new iPhones, and some of the ones that ditch Android for iPhone grab their data on the way out using Apple\u2019s tool.\nSo yes, it appears that the iPhone is definitely stealing plenty of Android users, and Google can\u2019t hide it.",

        "body": "After a year of work, Overcast 2 is now available as a free update for everyone. It\u2019s mostly a major under-the-hood improvement, with relatively few user-facing changes. But they\u2019re pretty good, I think.\nAnd now, all features are free, and I\u2019m trying a new business model.\nStreaming \u2601\ufe0f\nThe headlining feature of Overcast 2 is streaming. You can still download all episodes as you did before \u2014 I fixed some bugs there, too \u2014 but now, you have two more capabilities:\nStart playing any episode immediately and let it stream in, rather than waiting for it to completely download.\nOptionally set new episodes to stream instead of download, saving storage space.\nAnd with the new storage manager, you can see how much space your downloads are consuming for each show, and optionally delete the downloads and stream the episodes on demand.\nOvercast\u2019s streaming engine is completely custom-written and designed for modern devices, the modern mobile internet, and the expectations of today\u2019s customers, tightly integrated with Overcast\u2019s custom audio engine to be as fast and efficient as possible.\nAnd, of course, Smart Speed and Voice Boost are always available, even when streaming. I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\nAudio improvements\nEven if you don\u2019t plan to use streaming, you\u2019ll reap its benefits: converting the audio engine to a streaming architecture has made all playback faster to start, easier on battery life, more compatible, and more reliable. (And everyone wants to play an undownloaded episode right now sometimes.)\nSmart Speed and Voice Boost have also been quietly enhanced:\nSmart Speed is more efficient and now adapts dynamically to quieter voices.\nis more efficient and now adapts dynamically to quieter voices. Voice Boost tone has been subtly enhanced as I\u2019ve gotten better at audio production techniques.\nQuite simply, it sounds a bit nicer.\nChapters \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\nI was wrong. (Not for the first time.) Turns out that chapters are pretty nice. Don\u2019t doubt the Germans.\nSocial directory\nOvercast\u2019s podcast directory has always had a good search if you knew what you were looking for, but browsing was limited to very narrow editorial picks that I edited manually, badly, and infrequently. Since I sucked at that job, I fired myself and replaced me with someone far better: everyone else.\nNow, the directory categories are powered by recent recommendations by Overcast users. This is already surfacing far more diverse podcasts, and updating far more frequently, than I could ever offer as one person who mostly listens to tech shows.\nEverything else\nI\u2019ve made lots of other changes and fixed a lot more bugs. Some of the highlights:\n3D Touch launch shortcuts (more 3D Touch coming soon)\n(more 3D Touch coming soon) Swipe actions on episode cells\non episode cells Icon badge option\noption Play Next By Priority option for playlist behavior\noption for playlist behavior A complete overhaul of the show-artwork architecture\nFaster, more reliable communication with the Apple Watch app (watchOS 2 port coming later)\nMoved to a new database layer that fixed tons of bugs, including some remaining sync bugs and the infamous playlist-reordering bug (sorry!)\nPlus too many smaller improvements to list here.\nMy crazy new business model\nOvercast has always been free up front to bring the best app to the most people. But I\u2019m just one person, running this business the old-fashioned way, so it has to make money somehow.\nOvercast 1.0 locked the best features behind an in-app purchase, which about 20% of customers bought. This made enough money, but it had a huge downside:\n80% of my customers were using an inferior app. The limited, locked version of Overcast without the purchase sure wasn\u2019t the version I used, it wasn\u2019t a great experience, and it wasn\u2019t my best work.\nWith Overcast 2.0, I\u2019ve changed that by unlocking everything, for everyone, for free. I\u2019d rather have you using Overcast for free than not using it at all, and I want everyone to be using the good version of Overcast.\nIf you can pay, I\u2019m trying to make up the revenue difference by offering a simple $1 monthly patronage. It\u2019s completely optional, it doesn\u2019t get you any additional features, and it doesn\u2019t even auto-renew \u2014 it\u2019s just a direct way to support Overcast\u2019s ongoing development and hosting without having to make the app terrible for 80% of its users.\nIf only 5% of customers become monthly patrons, Overcast will match its previous revenue.\nPatrons may get special features in the future if I can\u2019t afford to offer something to everyone (due to hosting costs, etc.), but today, patronage is simply that: supporting Overcast directly, because you want to. And if you\u2019d rather not, no hard feelings.\nThanks, and I hope you enjoy Overcast 2.",

        "title": "DOJ: Apple owns your iPhone's software, so it should have a backdoor",
        "body": "The Department of Justice is trying to get Apple to unlock a defendant's iPhone. While Apple has stated that it can technically bypass the phone's passcode security, it has so far refused to do so for various reasons. So the DOJ has come up with a new strategy, force Apple to comply because it licenses the software on the phone. Because of that, the DOJ contends that the iPhone maker actually has a relationship with the phone that's currently evidence in a case. In a reply to Apple's response to the court order to unlock the phone, the government states, \"Apple cannot reap the legal benefits of licensing its software in this manner and then later disclaim any ownership or obligation to assist law enforcement when that same software plays a critical role in thwarting execution of a search warrant.\" In other words, it's your software Apple, not the defendant's, unlock it.\nThe government's strategy is a reaction to Apple's refusal to comply with a court order to unlock an iPhone 5s. In its response to the order Apple lawyers stated, \"forcing Apple to extract data in this case, absent clear legal authority to do so, could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand.\" It also noted that unlocking the phone would eat up resources and might not even yield any information. Plus, just for good measure, it would be impossible to circumvent the passcode of any iPhone running iOS 8 and later. The phone in question is running iOS 7.\nAs expected, the government isn't too happy about not having access to the phones of defendants. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been on a privacy crusade recently. He recently said that people have a, \"fundamental right to privacy.\" Cook has also insisted that the government does not have a backdoor into Apple's servers.\nAs Boing Boing points out, if the government succeeds with this argument, it opens up a terrifying precedent. Nearly every piece of technology has software that is licensed and not sold to the end user. All of those companies could be compelled to unlock, decrypt and allow the authorities access to these devices because it doesn't belong to the defendant, it belongs to the person that owns the software.",

        "body": "Apple has addressed the spate of chatter about differences in performance between A9 chips used in its new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. We\u2019ve known for a while that some A9 chips were produced by TSMC and others by Samsung, a longtime Apple silicon partner.\nRecently, people have been pushing and prodding at devices using both chips, coming up with numbers that point to theoretical 50-minute differences in battery life.\nIn a statement to TechCrunch, Apple said that its own testing and data gathered from its customers after a few weeks with the device show that the actual battery life of both devices varies just 2-3%. That\u2019s far, far too low to be noticeable in real-world usage.\nWith the Apple-designed A9 chip in your iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, you are getting the most advanced smartphone chip in the world. Every chip we ship meets Apple\u2019s highest standards for providing incredible performance and deliver great battery life, regardless of iPhone 6s capacity, color, or model. Certain manufactured lab tests which run the processors with a continuous heavy workload until the battery depletes are not representative of real-world usage, since they spend an unrealistic amount of time at the highest CPU performance state. It\u2019s a misleading way to measure real-world battery life. Our testing and customer data show the actual battery life of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, even taking into account variable component differences, vary within just 2-3% of each other.\nThough there have been a bunch of articles and videos about how much power one chip or the other uses, the tests have largely been what Apple calls \u2018manufactured\u2019. Basically, they are unrealistic machine-driven tests that do not and can not reflect real-world usage.\nThis is one reason why I only lightly rely on benchmarks in my reviews and try not to use unrealistic \u2018pristine\u2019 iOS installs in my own testing.\nYou know that opt-in dialog that asks if you\u2019d like to share diagnostic info with Apple that you see when you install iOS? This real-world (anonymized) data comes from those customers. They\u2019re seeing exactly how people are actually using their iPhones with their own apps \u2014 not how benchmarks power-drain them by running the CPUs at peak for sustained periods; something that is unlikely to happen in real-world situations.\nThe 2-3% difference Apple is saying it sees between the battery life of the two processors is well within its manufacturing tolerances for any device, even two iPhones with the same exact processor. In other words, your iPhone and someone else\u2019s iPhone with the same guts likely vary as much as 3%, regardless of who made them.\nBasically, if you can tell the difference in real-world usage between the two processors, you should take a Voigt-Kampff test.\nWhether you, personally, are offended that your device is on the higher end of that tolerance is not for me to say. Doesn\u2019t bother me, but it could bother you \u2014 but I would probably advise you not to let it.\nApple would not comment on why there were two different manufacturers for the A9 chips, but I can probably hazard a guess. For a start, couple the fact that the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus sold record numbers, but still remain in stock (in some sizes) in many stores with the fact that China was a day-one rollout this year. This points to higher production volumes than ever before, and likely a shortage of foundry/chip manufacturing facilities from a single vendor.\nTimothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company put out a report on the different A9 manufacturers, noting that it puts Apple in a position of strength going into the A10.\nIn this case, we believe that AAPL had planned to use Samsung for the initial wave of A9 builds, but also developed the TSMC solution as insurance against yield and allocation issues as it is the first [Apple] processor on FinFET. Given a host of issues including big differences in yields, AAPL was prepared to come to TSMC for more capacity allocation, if needed. \u2026 For AAPL, once yield issues are worked out, it will be in a great position to exert maximum pressure on each foundry in future capacity contracting. Barring the foundries pushing back (e.g., Samsung maybe bows out on A10?), this seems likely to continue going forward \u2013 especially since [Intel] desperately wants the [Apple] foundry business. This could open a window. With 10nm not available in time for the A10 launch, [Intel\u2019s] 14nm offers a meaningful improvement in performance and power consumption over the TSMC and Samsung 16nm/14nm nodes as it uses a next-generation FinFET.\nSplitting its orders between two vendors likely makes sense for Apple for other reasons as well. It could, for instance, be dipping its extremities further into the TSMC waters when it comes to producing chips . If the TSMC chips are performing at about the same level as the Samsung chips (or even a bit better in some metrics), that\u2019s a good thing for Apple because it reduces their reliance on Samsung, a (parent) company with which it competes when it comes to the end product that the Samsung silicon powers.\nThe big takeaway here shouldn\u2019t be that there are a couple of percentage points of difference between the two bits of silicon, but that Apple has kept up with demand for the first time in forever \u2014 and that it is setting the stage for what could allow it more control over its chip design with less conflict.\nArticle updated to add context from analyst note.",

        "title": "Tim Cook: \"Apple TV orders will kick off on Monday, October 26 with shipments beginning by the end of the week.\"",
        "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook is on stage for the opening night of the WSJDLive conference in Palm Springs, California, with Wall Street Journal editor Gerry Baker interviewing Cook about a variety of topics. Live coverage of the interview is being offered by publications including WSJ.D and The Verge, and we'll be updating this post with highlights from the session.\n- On whether Apple wants to control every facet of our lives: Apple does very few products, and puts a lot of care into them, but Apple does want you to have a seamless experience throughout your home and work life.\n- Citing competitive reasons, Cook once again declines to share Apple Watch sales numbers. \"We shipped a lot the first quarter, then last quarter we shipped even more. And I can predict this quarter we will ship even more.\" Addressing Baker's skepticism about the device, Cook refers to customer satisfaction being \"off the charts.\"\n- Talking now about iPhone 6s and the iPhone Upgrade Program, Cook insists it's not meant to compete with carriers. It's simply a plan for people who want to get a new iPhone every year. Addressing the need to keep innovating on iPhone and whether Apple is on a two-year cycle as it appears to many people, Cook stresses all of the new features included on the iPhone 6s.\n- Cook says Apple Music has 6.5 million paying customers and 8.5 million more still on free trials. Cook stresses the human curation aspect of Apple Music and notes the company feels \"fantastic\" about customer uptake so far.\n- Regarding Apple TV, Cook sees it as a \"foundation\" for a new type of experience as Apple tries to fix the \"broken\" experience of watching television. With Apple TV, providers like HBO can sell directly to consumers. The current system of \"linear TV\" with channels needs to be \"brought up and modernized\" and apps will help do that.\n- Apple TV orders will kick off on Monday, October 26 with shipments beginning by the end of that week.\n- Baker asks about Apple's car project, but Cook hesitates to say much. He does admit that software becomes increasingly important, and that enables other shifts like electrification and autonomous control. But in the short term, Apple wants people to have the iPhone experience in the car. \"We'll see what we do in the future.\"\n- On the retail front, Cook notes Apple will have 40 stores in China by the end of next year, and China currently provided in the \"mid-20s\" percentage of Apple's revenue. Angela Ahrendts has also been focused on integrating online and in-store shopping experiences.\n- Cook and Baker talking about user privacy, with Cook giving his usual comments about how privacy is a key value for Apple but that the company believes it can still provide an excellent customer experience and services while maintaining that privacy. In response to a question about Apple's relationship to national security organizations, Cook says he is \"very\" comfortable with it and he shares the company's views that any software backdoors are unacceptable and encryption is a necessity. A rather tense debate about the tradeoff between privacy and national security ensues.\n- Final question of the interview is about Apple increasing its willingness to speak out on issues and take leadership roles, and Cook notes Apple has a \"responsibility to be a great global citizen.\" Cook points to the environment, human rights, and education as areas where it can lead. Cook says Apple has stepped up its efforts to \"leave the world better than we found it\" because \"government isn't working well.\" Cook says Apple isn't worried about alienating customers with its stances, noting the company isn't forcing its views on anyone, and he hopes people who may be upset with Apple's positions in these areas can still think Apple makes great products and respect Apple for making efforts to put its values into practice.",

        "title": "\"AdBlock\" extension for Safari and Chrome has been bought out by an undisclosed company for an undisclosed amount; now allows \"acceptable\" ads by default.",
        "body": "Adblock, a popular extension for blocking advertising in Chrome and Safari with more than 40 million users, was quietly sold today.\nThe extension displayed a popup on October 1 saying that it is now allowing EyeO\u2019s acceptable advertising \u2014 which allows advertisers to buy their way onto the whitelist \u2014 through the filter.\nhttps://twitter.com/aahaworth/status/649702548358701056\nBuried in the bottom of that message, however, was a more notable change: Adblock has been sold.\nThe <3 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\nWhat\u2019s strange is that the company won\u2019t disclose who it\u2019s been sold to, why it was sold, or how much it was sold for.\nFor the extension\u2019s claimed 40 million users this raises an interesting question: Can the extension continue to be trusted if the new proprietor is entirely anonymous?\nTNW contacted Adblock\u2019s remaining staff to ask if they\u2019d disclose the buyer but the company refused, saying that the purchaser had specifically asked not to be named.\nThe only thing the team would tell us is that the tool\u2019s creator Michael Gundlach will no longer have any relationship with the company \u2014 that probably means he\u2019s cashed out.\nAdblock\u2019s previous director, Gabriel Cubbage, is now running things under the new owner.\nSince its launch in 2009, Adblock featured a screen that pushed users to pay for the use of the extension because it was classed as \u201chonor-ware.\u201d An ironic gesture, considering its existence technically deprives others of money.\nGundlach worked full time on Adblock after he quit his job in 2011, able to survive on the proceeds of donations from users prompted to \u2018gift\u2019 money toward the development when installing the extension.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is six months ago Adblock changed its name suddenly to BetaFish Adblocker, claiming it was an \u201cexperiment.\u201d\nBetaFish is the name of Gundlach\u2019s holding company that owned Adblock and around the same time had applied for a US trademark on the word \u2018Adblock.\u2019\nSupport staff claimed five months ago that the company was not being purchased by someone or preparing for participation acceptable ad program, but the move may have pre-empted today\u2019s deal.\nThe name was later changed back to simply \u2018Adblock\u2019 without further explanation.\nThe sale comes at an interesting time for publishers as the debate rages over whether adblocking will become widespread, as Apple has allowed iOS user to block ads on their mobile devices for the first time.\nFor users of Adblock, the uncertainty over ownership of the Adblock extension is a reasonable concern, particularly if the new buyer has any sort of agenda with the purchase of the extension.\nWhy would they keep their identity secret, if it\u2019s a legitimate deal? It\u2019s possible that the new owner simply wants to sit back and let the cash roll in, or was looking for a way to gain back some control.\nWe\u2019ve contacted Michael Gundlach for further comment on the sale and secrecy, but haven\u2019t heard back at time of writing.",
