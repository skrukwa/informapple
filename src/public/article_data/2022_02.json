        "body": "An Android statue is displayed in front of a building on the Google campus on January 31, 2022 in Mountain View, California. Google parent company Alphabet will report fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday after the closing bell.\nGoogle on Wednesday announced it's adopting new privacy restrictions that will cut tracking across apps on its Android devices, following a similar move made by Apple last year that upended several firms' advertising practices.\nGoogle said it's developing new privacy-focused replacements for its advertising ID, a unique string of characters that identifies the user's device. The digital IDs in smartphones often help ad-tech companies track and share information about consumers.\nThe changes could affect big companies that have relied on tracking users across apps, like Facebook parent Meta. Apple's adjustments hit Meta particularly hard, for example. Meta said earlier this month Apple's privacy changes will decrease the social media company's sales this year by about $10 billion. That news contributed to wiping $232 billion from the company's market cap in a single day, eventually pushing the total below $600 billion. Last June, Meta was worth more than $1 trillion.\nBut while Meta fought against Apple's changes, it voiced support for the way Google plans to implement its privacy tweaks.",

        "title": "Apple's retail employees are reportedly using Android phones and encrypted chats to keep unionization plans secret",
        "body": "Apple may be the world\u2019s largest company with a market cap of almost $3 trillion, but its retail workers seem to hardly benefit from all that success, according to the latest reports. As a result, employees at several Apple Stores across the US are secretly working to unionize based on issues surrounding their take-home pay.\nThe dissent has seen employees of at least two US Apple Stores garner support from national unions on their way to making submissions to the National Labor Relations Board, per sources speaking to The Washington Post. What\u2019s more, another six locations are supposedly at less-advanced stages in the unionization process.\nApple\u2019s hourly rates are consistent with what other retailers pay in the same regions, but the animosity comes from the fact that most of those other companies do not earn nearly as much as the tech giant. Rising inflation and housing prices across the country are impacting unionization decisions, too, and many of the workers feel like their hourly wages are not keeping pace. The pro-union workers spoke to the media outlet in confidence, not yet wanting to let out their identities to avoid possible retaliation from Apple. To avoid eavesdropping by store managers and ensure they remain anonymous, the said employees have also reportedly been using encrypted chats and even Android phones.\nApple has more than 270 locations in the United States alone and employs over 65,000 retail workers. The company is known for its loyal customers and employees alike and has seen astonishing growth in recent years. It generated over $365 billion in revenue for the twelve months leading up to September 30, 2021 \u2014 a 33% increase year-over-year. The company did say that it plans to increase retail employees' pay by between 2% and 10% \"depending on the store location and role,\" according to Bloomberg, and will double the number of sick days offered for both full-time and part-time employees, along with increases to vacation day allotments and paid parental leave up to six weeks.\nThe retail employees' fight for unionization was reportedly inspired by recent wins at several Starbucks stores around the US, which started at a store in Buffalo, New York and has since spread to nearly 100 stores across the country.",

        "title": "Facebook says Apple iOS privacy change will result in $10 billion revenue hit this year",
        "body": "watch now\nFacebook Chief Executive Officer and founder, Mark Zuckerberg, leaving the Merrion Hotel in Dublin after meeting with Irish politicians to discuss regulation of social media, transparrency in political advertising and the safety of young people and vulnerable adults. On Tuesday, April 2, 2019, in Dublin, Ireland. Artur Widak | NurPhoto | Getty Images\nMeta shares sank 23% in extended trading on Wednesday after the company warned about numerous challenges and came up short on user numbers. Facebook said first quarter revenue will be $27 billion to $29 billion, while analysts were expecting that number to exceed $30 billion. Wehner said the $10 billion revenue hit this year is merely a best guess. \"We're just estimating what we think is the overall impact of the cumulative iOS changes to where the 2022 revenue forecast is,\" Wehner said. \"If you aggregate the changes that we're seeing on iOS, that's the order of magnitude. We can't be precise on this. It's an estimate.\"\nApple CEO Tim Cook delivers a keynote during the European Union's privacy conference at the EU Parliament in Brussels, Belgium October 24, 2018. Yves Herman | Reuters\nApple first introduced the ATT feature in iOS 14.5, which was released for iPhones last year. It's also included in iOS 15, which is running on 72% of modern iPhones, according to Apple. ATT consists of popups that ask users whether they want to be tracked when opening up an app. If the user says no, the app developer can no longer access the IDFA, a device ID that's used to target and measure the effectiveness of online ads. A study from ad measurement firm AppsFlyer in October suggested that 62% of iPhone users were choosing to opt-out of sharing their IDFA. The privacy feature disrupts the behind-the-scenes mechanics of many mobile ads, especially those that confirm whether a purchase or download was made. IPhone apps with targeted advertising can instead use SKAdNetwork, an Apple tool built as an alternative, which Apple says is more private. Online advertising companies have voiced their displeasure with the feature since it was first announced in June 2020, but Facebook has been the loudest in its criticism. In December 2020, Facebook ran a marketing campaign including full-page ads in major newspapers blasting the feature and saying that the change was about \"profit, not privacy.\" The next day, Apple CEO Tim Cook used Facebook's app in a tweet as an example of how the feature works. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's operating chief, said on Wednesday that ATT would hurt small businesses that rely on digital advertising to grow and are much more dependent than larger companies on personalized ads. It's a theme Facebook has hit repeatedly in its attacks on Apple. Sandberg said the changes are diminishing the accuracy of Facebook's ads, driving up prices based on an outcome like a sale or download. She also said that measuring whether those conversions occur is becoming more difficult. A day before Facebook's results, Alphabet blew past estimates with its fourth-quarter numbers, and cited strength in e-commerce ads, an area where Facebook saw weakness. Wehner suggested that Apple's changes aren't having the same impact on search as they are on other types of apps. He referenced how much money Google makes for Apple as the default search engine on the Safari browser. \"Given that Apple continues to take billions of dollars a year from Google Search, the incentive clearly is for this policy discrepancy to continue,\" Wehner said.

        "title": "Mac users report Zoom using their microphone outside calls",
        "body": "Apple Mac users running the Zoom meetings app are reporting that it's seemingly keeping their computer's microphone on when they aren't using it.\nThe issue appears to affect the native app running on the latest macOS release, Monterey, in which Apple has implemented a visual cue to alert users that an application or device is accessing their microphone or camera \u2014 via an orange or green dot in the Menu Bar, respectively.\nUsers began complaining that the mic seems to be left active after Monterey was released late last year, and on December 27, Zoom put out an update that was meant to address the bug, stating that version 5.9.1 (3506) \"resolved an issue regarding the microphone light indicator being triggered when not in a meeting.\"\nHowever, it clearly hasn't fixed the issue for everyone.\nZoom has enjoyed massive growth and popularity due to worldwide COVID-19 lockdowns, and many people now use it as a videophone app \u2013 meaning that they leave it open in the background all the time, even when they aren't actively using it, so that they can receive Zoom calls unbidden. These users have complained, however, that Zoom appears to be keeping the microphone on constantly, even when they're not in a call.\nAnd if the mic isn't actually live, this defeats the purpose of the indicator.\nUsers on a Zoom community chat thread noted that even after installing the update, the issue persisted, with one commenting: \"Well, that most recent update seems to have made no obvious difference. I've just noticed the orange dot again, and when I quit Zoom, Timing.app told me that I'd apparently been on a 2 hour Zoom call.\n\"At this point, it looks like it's safest to only run Zoom while on active calls and keep it quit otherwise.\"\nTwitter users concurred this morning, with one dev commenting, \"You can see the orange dot on Mac since the last update, that shows mic usage.\"\nZoom is no stranger to privacy fears. At one point it installed a hidden web server on customers' Macs to enable automatic call handling. Notably, Apple updated macOS to remove the hidden program.\nThe Register asked Zoom for comment yesterday afternoon. A company rep told us they \"were looking into this.\" We'll update if a statement arrives.\nIn the meantime, if you'd like to know if apps are snooping on you, there are various third-party products such as Micro Snitch or OverSight to help you to monitor who's monitoring you. \u00ae",

        "title": "Some U.S. Apple Store Employees Are Working to Unionize",
        "body": "Listen 8 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\nEmployees at several Apple Stores across the country are quietly working to unionize, according to people familiar with the efforts, as growing dissent among hourly workers threatens to disrupt one of the most stolid tech giants. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight Groups at at least two Apple retail stores are backed by major national unions and are preparing to file paperwork with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in the near future, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential plans. At least a half dozen more locations are at less-advanced stages in the unionization process, these people say.\nSpurred by wages that have stagnated below the rate of inflation, and encouraged by successful efforts by Starbucks employees to form unions, retail workers say they hope they can push the world\u2019s most valuable company to share more of its record-setting profits with the workers who sell, repair and troubleshoot the products it sells.\nAdvertisement\nApple has more than 500 retail locations around the world and more than 270 in the United States, according to its website. It employs more than 65,000 retail workers. Sales through Apple retail stores and the Apple website made up 36 percent of the company\u2019s $366 billion in total revenue in the 2021 fiscal year, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\nApple has seen astonishing revenue growth in recent years, bringing in $378 billion in the last calendar year, compared with $240 billion in 2017. Its astronomical cash flow has allowed the company to spend tens of billions a year in stock buybacks and dividends for investors, buoying its share price.\nRetail employees interviewed by The Washington Post say they haven\u2019t shared in the company\u2019s gains. Apple retail employees can earn anywhere from $17 to more than $30 per hour, depending on their market and position, and receive between $1,000 and around $2,000 in stock, they said. But those wages have not kept up with inflation over the years, they say, which means retail employees are making less as they sell more Apple products.\nAdvertisement\nEmployees say Apple\u2019s hourly rates are usually in line with what other retail jobs pay in the regions where they\u2019re employed. But most other retailers do not earn so much in revenue, nor are they valued at near $3 trillion. Apple Store employees interviewed by The Post believe their knowledge and passion for the products help drive sales and that they should share more fully in the company\u2019s success.\nMeanwhile, Apple\u2019s board this year proposed a $99 million compensation package for Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\u201cI have a lot of co-workers and friends who I genuinely love and they do not make enough to get by,\u201d said one labor organizer who works at an Apple retail store. \u201cThey\u2019re struggling and they\u2019re hurting and we work for a company that has the resources to make sure that they\u2019re taken care of.\u201d\nApple did not have immediate comment.\nThe labor efforts at Apple Stores come as unions are starting to make a comeback after decades of decline. More than 80 Starbucks venues and counting have filed to unionize since the first store started the trend last August, with a successful vote in December. Last month, employees at an REI store in Manhattan filed to form a union. And employees at Raven Software, a division of Activision Blizzard, formed a union called the Game Workers Alliance last month. Google employees a year ago formed a union, but did not certify with the NLRB.\nAdvertisement\nNot all cases have been successful. In April 2021, employees at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., voted against unionizing in a closely watched test case. Workers got a second chance to vote, after the NLRB found irregularities the first time around. The new vote will be decided sometime next month.\nApple is known for its loyal base of more than 150,000 employees, but the fact that its retail workers want to unionize reflects the way the company\u2019s sheen has worn off in recent years. Some employees have increasingly voiced disapproval with how Apple handles alleged discrimination, harassment and bullying in the workplace, as well as work-from-home policies.\nApple Store workers interviewed by The Post said the company is an attractive one to work for and promises promotions to management or \u201ccorporate.\u201d But those sometimes fail to materialize.\nAdvertisement\nMatt Herbst recently left an Ohio Apple Store for another job in part for that reason. After starting there five years ago, he earned a shot at what the company calls a \u201ccareer experience,\u201d a six-month stint at Apple\u2019s headquarters in California. But the store wouldn\u2019t allow him to go, he said, because of a worker shortage caused by the pandemic. Herbst, now 24, detailed his experience at Apple in a recent blog post.\n\u201cI do think a union would be beneficial for retail employees,\u201d he said.\nIn recent weeks, Apple has offered raises to some of its retail employees. But workers at several Apple Stores said the raises in some cases backfired. Some employees got raises of less than a dollar per hour, when they were hoping for more than $5. Many employees say they got raises that don\u2019t compensate for recent inflation. Because of inflation, they effectively make less money than when they started, they added.\nAdvertisement\nBefore officially filing, Apple Store organizers have been informally gauging interest among the staff, hoping that more than half of the employees will vote to unionize, people familiar with the matter say, the threshold needed to gain official legal standing with the NLRB.\nIn at least one case, store employees hoped to gain at least 80 percent support before officially filing to form a union. That\u2019s because the organizers expect that Apple will try to convince employees to vote against the union.\nTo avoid detection by managers at the stores, employees have been meeting in secret and communicating with encrypted messaging, sometimes using Android phones, the competitor to Apple\u2019s iOS operating system, to avoid any possible snooping by Apple.\nApple Store employees at one store said managers have already begun pulling employees aside and giving speeches about how unions will hurt employees, lower their wages and force Apple to take away benefits and opportunities, such as the \u201ccareer experience\u201d that Herbst described. Managers try to eavesdrop on employees, they said, while pretending to do something else.\nLabor organizers refer to this kind of activity as \u201cunion busting.\u201d Starbucks, for instance, recently urged its employees, which it calls \u201cpartners,\u201d to vote against unionizing, arguing that Starbucks could better address employee concerns by negotiating with them directly and saying a union would just get in the way.\nAdvertisement\nMore than 90 Starbucks stores have filed paperwork to form unions since a store in Buffalo became the first last summer. Apple Store employees hope that once the first store successfully unionizes, others will fall like dominoes.\nThe retail workers are getting support from a contingent of employees, including software engineers and product managers, who work at Apple corporate, as it\u2019s called by retail workers. Some Apple corporate employees have donated to The Coworker Solidarity Fund, a nonprofit that has helped employees from Apple and Netflix who have spoken up to criticize the companies.\nThat support is happening in secret, because employees fear they will face retaliation for aiding in labor organizing.\nLast year, Apple fired Janneke Parrish, who helped organize #AppleToo, a movement aimed at improving working conditions at the company, particularly for traditionally underrepresented groups. Parrish said she was being investigated for leaking information from a company all hands meeting, a charge she denies.\nAnd Cher Scarlett, a software engineer who encouraged employees to share their salaries in a survey to expose possible wage disparities hurting underrepresented groups, alleged she was pushed out in retaliation for her efforts.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace. We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters,\u201d Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said previously.\nParrish and Scarlett both said they have been in contact with organizers at Apple retail stores and support their efforts. \u201cIf the richest company in the world won\u2019t pay its workers enough to live, who will?\u201d Scarlett said.\nOn Dec. 24, Apple retail employees staged a walkout and launched a new website, Apple Together, to help retail employees.\n\u201cApple does think stores are looking at organizing. I think they are looking at how unhappy retail workers are,\u201d Parrish said. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t know is how far some of these stores are into the process.\u201d\nGift this article Gift Article",

        "title": "Android Messages beta starts properly displaying iOS Message reactions",
        "body": "Google is widely rolling out a new Google Messages feature to beta users that allows the Android messaging app to correctly interpret emoji reactions sent from the iOS Messages app, 9to5Google reports. The feature appears to be live in version 20220121_02_RC00 of the app, according to Droid-Life, but not for every user. Although it didn\u2019t work on every phone we tried, we were able to get it working on an Oppo Find X3 Pro, which is more than can be said for when the feature initially started appearing last November.\nThe feature fixes a long-standing issue that can affect SMS chats between iPhone and Android users. When an iPhone user reacts to an Android message with emoji, the Android user typically sees this reaction sent as an entirely separate text message, resulting in confusion and lots of unnecessary clutter.\nHow the reactions appear to the recipient, on Android. Screenshot: Google Messages How the reactions appear to the sender, on iOS. Screenshot: Apple Messages\nPreviously, the thumbs down emoji in the above example would have been represented by a separate text message for Android users, saying a user \u201cdisliked\u201d the \u201cDo you agree?\u201d message. The new beta app now treats emoji reactions the same across both operating systems.\nAs 9to5Google points out, there are inconsistencies between how reactions are represented on each operating system. The thumbs up and thumbs down reactions are similar across both platforms, but iOS\u2019s \u201chaha\u201d reaction turns into \u201cface with tears of joy\u201d on Android, while \u201cheart\u201d becomes \u201csmiling face with heart-eyes.\u201d \u201cExclamation marks\u201d become \u201cface with open mouth\u201d while \u201cquestion mark\u201d is \u201cthinking face.\u201d These are minor differences, but they could lead to significantly different interpretations of a reaction\u2019s meaning.",

The picture also shows an older flat-screen TV, however, it is unclear if this piece of tech was also defenestrated during the dispute, or whether it has been deliberately placed there for disposal.\nApple's iMac has been a stalwart of the company's desktop lineup for many years, receiving a design overhaul that shifted it away from the chunky form factor to a slimmed-down version. Last year, the company launched its first-ever Apple silicon iMac to great acclaim featuring not only Apple silicon but also a slew of awesome colors and a distinctive new thin design.\nReports indicate the company is also working on a larger form factor iMac that may also feature mini-LED technology, as debuted in the M1 iPad Pro (2021) last year. Apple is reportedly shaping up to include its M1 Pro and M1 Max chips in the lineup, representing a big power upgrade over the M1 version.",

        "body": "Facebook parent company Meta (FB) reported its Q4 earnings on Wednesday, falling short of analysts' expectations on earnings per share, and missing on its Q1 outlook amid the continued crunch from Apple's iOS privacy changes.\nHere are the most important numbers from the report compared to what analysts were expecting, as compiled by Bloomberg.\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\nCrucially, Meta's Q1 2022 revenue came up short, with the company estimating between $27 billion to $29 billion in the current quarter, below analysts' expectations of $30.25 billion.\nShares of Meta plummeted 22% following the report.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. REUTERS/Andreas Gebert\nThe quarter marks the first time Meta has reported its earnings as a company focused on building out the metaverse, not just social media apps like Facebook and Instagram. But Meta has warned it will take time to build out its metaverse capabilities to the level where users can interact with each other across vast virtual worlds via augmented reality and virtual reality headsets.\nQ4 was also the first quarter in which Meta released revenue numbers for its Reality Labs segment, which piled up losses of $3.3 billion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg previously announced that the company spent $10 billion on its metaverse effort in 2021.\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\nMore pressing in the near term is Meta\u2019s ability to continue to navigate Apple\u2019s (AAPL) recent privacy changes that allow iOS users to opt out of letting their apps track them across the web. The feature, called App Tracking Transparency, has been a roadblock for apps like Facebook and Snap (SNAP), which rely on that kind of data to sell ads to advertisers.\nAnd according to Meta CFO David Wehner, the iOS feature will hurt Meta moving forward.\n\"We will lap a period in which Apple's iOS changes were not in effect and we anticipate modestly increasing ad targeting and measurement headwinds from platform and regulatory changes,\" he said.\nWehner also pointed to inflation and supply chain disruptions, as well as exchange rates as the company's other pain points.\nStory continues\nThat\u2019s not Meta\u2019s only problem, though. The company continues to face increasing competition from the likes of TikTok and Snap, and, more importantly, must contend with an ongoing antitrust lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission.\nLast month, District Judge James Boasberg ruled that the FTC\u2019s suit against Meta can continue despite protests from the social networking company. In its suit, the FTC alleges that Meta ran a buy or bury scheme in which it sought to quash competition from smaller up-and-coming rivals.\nThe commission ultimately wants to break Meta up into smaller social networks. Without its combined network of apps, however, Meta would lose its spot as the world\u2019s largest social media company. Whether that comes to pass, however, will take years to determine, as the suit is unlikely to be resolved in short order.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter\nMore from Dan\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit\nGot a tip?

        "title": "Apple Watch detects symptom of thyroid issue months ahead of diagnosis",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nA nursing student in Australia is encouraging Apple Watch owners to enable heart rate notifications, after the wearable device detected symptoms of a thyroid condition months before being diagnosed.\nApple's heart rate notifications have helped numerous people detect issues with their heart, prompting them to go and seek further medical assistance. In a recent posting to TikTok, it's shown the wearable device can detect very early changes that could end up being diagnosed months later.\nPosted on February 2, TikTok user Lauren encouraged viewers of her video to enable notifications for detecting low and high heart rates, irregular rhythms, and for cardio fitness levels. In the video, spotted by The Independent, the Sydney-based nursing student admitted that she should've enabled the features earlier than she did, as it had medical consequences.\nIn Lauren's explanation, she says she was diagnosed with a thyroid condition a few weeks previously. However, she admits \"I would have realized something was going on if my Apple alerted me of changes.\"\n\"Instead of me waiting for the symptoms to get really bad, I could have gone to the doctor back in October, when there was this dramatic drop in a matter of days,\" Lauren adds, alongside a screenshot of a graph from the Health app. \"It dramatically dropped, which means my cardiovascular system wasn't working as well as it once was.\"\nThe drop also correlated with other symptoms, including fatigue, a sensitivity to heat, gaining weight, dry skin, and increased irritability. In December, she was diagnosed with thyroid hemiagenesis, and is undergoing treatment.\nLauren admits the Apple Watch wasn't an item she considered as being a provider of health and medical advice normally, but it was still useful. \"Don't get me wrong, your Apple Watch is definitely not something you should follow as medical advice, but it can come in handy, I guess, as a tool to prompt you to go get things investigated further.\"\n\"But on this occasion, I really wish that I had all the settings toggled on and noticed the changes and gone to the doctor sooner.\"",

The bill will now head to the Senate floor for a vote.\nApple had urged the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee to reject the bill, arguing that sideloading would pose privacy and security risks for customers.\n\"Sideloading would enable bad actors to evade Apple's privacy and security protections by distributing apps without critical privacy and security checks. These provisions would allow malware, scams and data-exploitation to proliferate,\" said Apple's government affairs head Tim Powderly in a letter sent to the Committee earlier this week.\nLast month, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, another antitrust bill that would allow sideloading and which Apple spoke out against, citing the same privacy and security risks.\nThe passage of the Open App Markets Act out of the Senate Judiciary committee brings us one step closer to having this legislation signed into law.

        "body": "February 8, 2022\nPRESS RELEASE\nApple empowers businesses to accept contactless payments through Tap to Pay on iPhone\nLater this year, US merchants will be able to accept Apple Pay and other contactless payments simply by using iPhone and a partner-enabled iOS app\nCUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced plans to introduce Tap to Pay on iPhone. The new capability will empower millions of merchants across the US, from small businesses to large retailers, to use their iPhone to seamlessly and securely accept Apple Pay, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets through a simple tap to their iPhone \u2014 no additional hardware or payment terminal needed. Tap to Pay on iPhone will be available for payment platforms and app developers to integrate into their iOS apps and offer as a payment option to their business customers. Stripe will be the first payment platform to offer Tap to Pay on iPhone to their business customers, including the Shopify Point of Sale app this spring. Additional payment platforms and apps will follow later this year.\n\u201cAs more and more consumers are tapping to pay with digital wallets and credit cards, Tap to Pay on iPhone will provide businesses with a secure, private, and easy way to accept contactless payments and unlock new checkout experiences using the power, security, and convenience of iPhone,\u201d said Jennifer Bailey, Apple\u2019s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. \u201cIn collaboration with payment platforms, app developers, and payment networks, we\u2019re making it easier than ever for businesses of all sizes \u2014 from solopreneurs to large retailers \u2014 to seamlessly accept contactless payments and continue to grow their business.\u201d\nOnce Tap to Pay on iPhone becomes available, merchants will be able to unlock contactless payment acceptance through a supporting iOS app on an iPhone XS or later device. At checkout, the merchant will simply prompt the customer to hold their iPhone or Apple Watch to pay with Apple Pay, their contactless credit or debit card, or other digital wallet near the merchant\u2019s iPhone, and the payment will be securely completed using NFC technology. No additional hardware is needed to accept contactless payments through Tap to Pay on iPhone, so businesses can accept payments from wherever they do business. Apple Pay is already accepted at more than 90 percent of US retailers, and with this new capability, virtually every business, big or small, will be able to allow their customers to Tap to Pay on iPhone at checkout. Tap to Pay on iPhone will also roll out to Apple Store locations in the US later this year.\nPrivacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple\u2019s payment features. With Tap to Pay on iPhone, customers\u2019 payment data is protected by the same technology that makes Apple Pay private and secure. All transactions made using Tap to Pay on iPhone are encrypted and processed using the Secure Element, and as with Apple Pay, Apple doesn\u2019t know what is being purchased or who is buying it.\nApple will work closely with leading payment platforms and app developers across the payments and commerce industry to offer Tap to Pay on iPhone to millions of merchants in the US. Tap to Pay on iPhone complements and enhances the robust suite of payment and commerce tools that payment platforms and app developers provide to their merchant customers to help them run and grow their businesses. Tap to Pay on iPhone will work with contactless credit and debit cards from leading payment networks, including American Express, Discover, Mastercard, and Visa.\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re a salesperson at an internet-first retailer or an individual entrepreneur, you can soon accept contactless payments on a device that\u2019s already in your pocket: your iPhone,\u201d said Billy Alvarado, Stripe\u2019s chief business officer. \u201cWith Tap to Pay on iPhone, millions of businesses using Stripe can enhance their in-person commerce experience by offering their customers a fast and secure checkout.\u201d\nTap to Pay on iPhone will be available to participating payment platforms and their app developer partners to leverage in their software developer kits (SDKs) in an upcoming iOS software beta.\nAbout Apple\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nNorway's oil fund has declared it will be voting against a pay policy that would provide Apple CEO Tim Cook a $99 million compensation package along with other proposals ahead of Apple's annual shareholder meeting.\nApple will be holding its annual shareholder meeting virtually on Friday, March 4, giving an opportunity for votes to be cast on a number of proposals. Days ahead of the event, one organization has disclosed how it intends to vote.\nNorway's oil fund, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund valued at $1.3 trillion, said on Sunday it will be voting against Apple on pay policies. The disclosure includes one vote that would grant Tim Cook salary and bonuses valued at $99 million.\nThe fund said that a substantial part of annual pay should be provided in shares, which should be locked in for five to ten years, reports the Financial Times. It also says the board \"should provide transparency on total remuneration to avoid unacceptable outcomes.\"\nThe group will also be voting against Apple in relation to transparency, forced labor, an audit of civil rights, and sustainability disclosures.\nThe signaling by the fund follows after another declaration from February 16, when Institutional Shareholder Services told clients to vote against the pay and bonus package. ISS cited \"significant concern\" with the stock award in 2021.",

        "body": "The Apple Watch Series 7 brought a notable redesign with larger 41mm and 45mm sizes and even smaller display bezels than before. Now, a new report from Bloomberg indicates that 2022 could be the \u201cbiggest [year] in the history of the Apple since the original model\u201d with new features, the Apple Watch Series 8, and more.\nPlus, the increasingly slow and outdated Apple Watch Series 3 \u201cmay finally be retired.\u201d\nApple Watch Series 8 features, SE, and more\nIn the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman doubles down on his previous reporting that Apple will likely introduce three new Apple Watch models this year. Those models purportedly include:\nApple Watch Series 8\nAn updated Apple Watch SE\nAn Apple Watch geared toward extreme sports\nGurman goes on to say that he doesn\u2019t expect \u201cany major new health sensors\u201d for the Apple Watch this year, though there is a possibility that Apple finally adds a body temperature feature to the device. The changes that we can reportedly expect include \u201cmajor updates to activity tracking\u201d as well as continued performance improvements.\nFinally, Gurman also notes that this could finally be the year that the oft-maligned Apple Watch Series 3 is discontinued. As we\u2019ve covered here at 9to5Mac multiple times, the Apple Watch Series 3 has become increasingly hard to recommend despite its attractive price point.\nHere\u2019s the full blurb from Gurman about his expectations for the Apple Watch lineup this year:\nI think this year will be the biggest in the history of the Apple Watch since the original model. I\u2019m looking for three new models this fall: an Apple Watch Series 8, an Apple Watch SE and an Apple Watch geared toward extreme sports. I wouldn\u2019t expect any major new health sensors this year, besides the possible inclusion of the oft-discussed body temperature feature. But look out for major updates to activity tracking and faster chips across the board. Also, the Apple Watch Series 3 may finally be retired.\nWhat do you make of this report?

        "title": "TikTok Can Circumvent Apple and Google Privacy Protections and Access Full User Data, 2 Studies Say (Exclusive)",
        "body": "TikTok can circumvent security protections on Apple and Google app stores and uses device tracking that gives TikTok\u2019s Beijing-based parent company ByteDance full access to user data, according to the summaries of two major studies obtained by TheWrap that appear to confirm longstanding concerns raised by privacy experts about the popular video-sharing app.\nThe studies, conducted by \u201cwhite hat\u201d cybersecurity experts that hack for the public good, were completed in November 2020 and January 2021. TheWrap verified the studies and confirmed their conclusions with five independent experts.\nWhen asked by TheWrap, reps for TikTok \u2014 whose parent company ByteDance has had ties to the Chinese government \u2014 declined to confirm or deny the validity of the research.\nThe summaries of the studies, shared exclusively with TheWrap, suggest that TikTok is able to avoid code audits on the Apple and Google app stores. More alarmingly, the research found that TikTok is capable of changing the app\u2019s behavior as it pleases without users\u2019 knowledge and utilizes device tracking that essentially gives the company and third parties an all-access pass to user data. This is highly unusual and exceeds the abilities of U.S.-based apps such as Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms.\n\u201cThese dynamic properties allow TikTok carte blanche access to your device within the scope of what the application can see,\u201d said Frank Lockerman, cyber threat engineer at cybersecurity firm Conquest Cyber who reviewed the two \u201cwhite hat\u201d studies. \u201cThe TikTok browser not only has access to convert from web to device, but it also has the ability to query things on the device itself.\u201d\nThird parties and advertisers can end up tracking TikTok users over time across devices and installs, according the summary of a white-hat cybersecurity group\u2019s January 2021 study obtained by TheWrap.\nWhile TikTok contends that its methods are standard, especially for social media apps relying on ads, both the researchers and independent experts say that the app\u2019s code makes it much harder to monitor. \u201cConsequentially, just because the application doesn\u2019t do anything bad today, doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t do bad things in the future,\u201d one study said.\nStory continues\nAfter reviewing the studies\u2019 findings, Russ Jowell, mobile development expert at BestApp.com, said that it is difficult to know the full extent of TikTok\u2019s data mining capabilities and intent. But overall, he said: \u201cIt seems to me that ByteDance has gone to monumental lengths \u2014 possibly more than Facebook, Twitter and other social networks \u2014 to conceal the inner workings of their app.\u201d\nA spokesperson for TikTok declined to address the studies directly, but told TheWrap that the company adheres to app store policies, adding that its product meets information security standards in the U.S., the U.K., Ireland, India and Singapore and recently received certification by the ioXt Alliance for meeting standards and commitments to cybersecurity and transparency. In fact, TikTok said it works with the ethical hacker community and researchers through a program called HackerOne to test its product.\n\u201cThe security and privacy of our global community is always a top priority,\u201d the company said in a statement provided to TheWrap. \u201cStaying ahead of next-generation cyberthreats requires continuously strengthening the security of our platform, which is why we continually work to validate our security standards and collaborate with industry-leading experts to test our defenses.\u201d\nNonetheless, some countries have made their own decisions regarding TikTok. The app itself is not available in China, and India banned it in 2020 over national security concerns.\nAfter former president Donald Trump attempted to ban the Chinese-owned app as part of his executive order in 2020, the Biden administration last June dropped the outright ban but is now considering new regulations that would affect foreign-owned services, namely TikTok. The proposed rules from the Department of Commerce would add criteria for Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to consider when reviewing software that pose an \u201cundue or unacceptable risk.\u201d\nIn a short time, TikTok\u2019s popularity seems unstoppable, more than doubling U.S. users between 2019 and 2021, to 78.7 million. The social video app is gaining at speeds that threaten the growth of 18-year-old Facebook and its younger platform Instagram \u2014 both of which are losing the fight over younger users. Last September, TikTok hit a milestone of 1 billion monthly users and is on track to gain more Gen Z users than Instagram and more total users than Snap by 2023, according to eMarketer estimates.\nDespite growing interest in regulating the company, TikTok remains a major platform for creators and companies to penetrate the millennial and Gen Z markets. Plus, the app is starting to attract more older users even as it explores making the leap to TV screens. In March 2021, the platform\u2019s reach among users aged 35 to 44 doubled to around 18% when compared to the previous year, according to Comscore. Those aged 45 to 54 accounted for 14.6% of total unique visitors during that period, and those 65 and over accounted for 3.5%, tripled from 2020.\nRepresentatives for Apple and Google didn\u2019t respond to TheWrap\u2019s requests for comment.\n(Insider Intelligence)\nUnder the hood\nIn examining TikTok\u2019s source code in 2020 and 2021, the two studies examined how the app collects data on contacts, device ID and clipboard actions and conceals data being sent to and from TikTok\u2019s servers. TheWrap was not able to obtain the full text of the two studies, but spoke to five independent experts who reviewed the results.\nThe studies show TikTok uses device IDs \u2014 numbers and letters identifying individual devices \u2014 for ad integration, which means advertisers can end up tracking people over time across devices and installs. \u201cOnce one advertiser has a device ID that\u2019s correlated, all privacy is gone,\u201d one report noted.\nReferring TheWrap to its FAQ page, a TikTok rep said: \u201cThe TikTok app is not unique in the amount of information it collects, compared to other mobile apps. In line with industry standards, we collect information that users choose to provide to us in order to improve the experience people have on our app. Also like our peers, we constantly update our app to keep up with evolving security challenges.\u201d\nExamining the backend, researchers also found that the app essentially acts like a web browser. It uses a JavaScript bridge, the programming language for the web, to directly pull the app from TikTok\u2019s servers when it\u2019s launched. This makes the security of the app hard to assess, because that can keep changing, according to Lockerman at Conquest Cyber. Theoretically, it also means TikTok can change its app behavior dynamically or test certain things on the fly without pushing an update to users.\n\u201cThis has great significance to the security of the app, because the state of it cannot be determined by static analysis of the app alone,\u201d Lockerman said.\nOne white-hat security group\u2019s Android analysis of TikTok app from January 2021 shows how the code uses many native libraries thwarts Google code analysis.\nBecause the code uses many native libraries, it can \u201cthwart Google Store code analysis using these libraries,\u201d Lockerman explained. This makes the app harder to reverse engineer, as the code doesn\u2019t rely on system libraries already made available to developers. In coding, libraries are sets of code used for specific tasks. And by effectively running as a web app, the app is capable of circumventing Apple and Google code audits, the research said.\nTikTok maintained that its app is not a web browser that can be rewritten constantly and restated that it follows Google and Apple store policies. The company said the app does operate by pulling server data, such as the latest configuration settings, but that this is standard practice to ensure its performance.\nApple and Google\u2019s app stores are known to be very strict in implementing measures to protect users from illegal activity, fake apps and other potential dangers. Countless apps have been banned for disguising themselves as tools, such as photo filters or camera scanners, with the intent of scamming users and going after their money and personal information. The Android app store, for example, enforces guidelines on app permissions, user experience and overall accessibility to maintain high-quality apps.\nOn the Apple app, the studies indicated TikTok made its own version of a video player presumably to ensure the code runs properly \u2014 but Lockerman said it\u2019s also likely used to hide things. Additionally, the app relies on a \u201cprefetch system\u201d to load up multiple videos simultaneously in the background while the user is watching. This improves speed, which is in large part what makes TikTok so successful at getting users hooked. By tracking how long users linger on content or which videos they rewatch, TikTok\u2019s algorithm can \u201clearn\u201d people\u2019s interests and drive engagement much faster than its rivals.\nTikTok explained only that it created its own video player to optimize performance for users.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that studies investigating the source code of apps is an analysis based on that point in time. Apps are updated often and corrected through patching.\nSo is TikTok safe to use?\nIn terms of personal safety of TikTok users, the concern is less about vulnerabilities that researchers found on the app than what TikTok is doing with all this information it gathers, Jeff Engle, president of Conquest Cyber, told TheWrap. The potential dangers, as is the case with all apps tracking user activity, is the risk of threats from external actors and the compromising of user data.\n\u201cAs with any social media, if you are not paying, then you are likely the product,\u201d Engle said. \u201cThe data you give, which almost always is more than users realize, can be hijacked, but that is an individual risk analysis on a user-by-user basis. The collection, control of distribution and manipulation of any social media makes it a powerful weapon.\u201d\nHowever, experts note that TikTok\u2019s data mining may be no worse than that of major social networks like Facebook \u2014 the difference is in what TikTok then does with the data. A study in January by mobile marketing company URL Genius comparing 10 social apps suggested TikTok was the top app collecting user data, such as IP address, location and search history, to share with third parties that can continue tracking across other sites even after you close the app.\nTikTok is actually the international version of social app Douyin, which was released in China in 2016. A year later, parent company ByteDance launched TikTok outside China after merging it with another of its apps, Musical.ly. In fact, TikTok\u2019s former employees have raised concerns over the control of its parent company and its ability to access American user data.\nWhile Facebook users voluntarily fill out personal information on their pages, from their education to where they live, TikTok\u2019s data collection is less obvious to the everyday user \u2014 the app records how long you stay on a video, who you engage with and what topics and content you rewatch the most.\nAcknowledging TikTok\u2019s rising influence, Jowell said it\u2019s unlikely these privacy concerns will cause people to delete the app altogether. But from a security standpoint, his advice is to avoid posting content that contains any personally-identifiable information and to change the settings and outfits you use in your posts. \u201cAlways remember, hitting that send or upload button is akin to your kids leaving the house when they are grown,\u201d Jowell said. \u201cOnce you do it, you no longer have full control of that piece of content.\u201d",

        "title": "Apple is 'ungodly well-managed,' Berkshire's Charlie Munger says",
        "body": "Billionaire investor Charlie Munger is singing Apple\u2019s praises. While the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) vice chairman, and Warren Buffett, Berkshire chairman, regularly point to their relative lack of knowledge of the tech industry, Apple (AAPL) is now Berkshire\u2019s largest stock holding.\nThe reason? Apple\u2019s management.\n\u201cI think Apple is one of the strong companies and will stay a strong company,\u201d Munger told Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an exclusive interview.\n\u201cI think it's ungodly well-managed,\u201d he added.\nMunger\u2019s comments came ahead of his appearance at The Daily Journal\u2019s annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, during which The Daily Journal chairman opined on everything from crypto to investing in China.\nCharlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (Getty Images)\nOver the past several years, Berkshire has built up its stake in Apple and other tech firms including Verizon and Amazon. But Munger is most impressed by Apple.\n\u201cI judge the strength of the company based on how much the customers love it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I've got zillions of friends who they'd almost part with their right arm before they'd part with their iPhone. That's a hugely powerful position to be in.\u201d\nApple has consistently posted impressive earnings results quarter after quarter. Take its Q1 report, for instance. While the pandemic and related supply chain crunch impacted Apple\u2019s iPad sales, the company still managed to move a record $71.6 billion worth of iPhones.\nIt wasn\u2019t just iPhones that sold well either, Apple also saw record revenue across its Mac, services and wearables businesses.\nOver the last 12 months, Apple\u2019s shares have climbed 28%, that\u2019s more or less tied with Google, up 27%, and better than peers like Microsoft, up 20%, and Amazon, which is down 3%.\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\nApple is also expected to roll out a number of new products this year, including a low-cost, 5G-capable iPhone SE, new Macs and iPads, and of course, its next-generation iPhone. Apple is also said to be preparing its first virtual reality/augmented reality headset for release later this year.\nStory continues\nThat product would be Apple\u2019s first new major device release since it debuted the Apple Watch in 2015. It would also mark what could be Apple\u2019s first steps into the metaverse, something that other companies, like Facebook parent Meta, are banking on as the next evolution of the internet.\nRegardless, if Apple continues to perform as well as it has under CEO Tim Cook, it\u2019ll likely continue to have Munger and Buffett\u2019s backing.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter\nMore from Dan\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit\nGot a tip?

        "title": "Apple will reportedly debut an M2 chip with four new Macs this year",
        "body": "Apple is reportedly gearing up to release several new Macs with an M2 chip later this year, according to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman\u2019s Power On newsletter. Gurman expects the company to debut a 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, 24-inch iMac, and a redesigned MacBook Air, all outfitted with the rumored M2 chip.\nThe M2 chip will be slightly faster than its predecessor\nApple hasn\u2019t offered any hints about the potential M2 chip, but Gurman thinks its CPU will be slightly faster than the M1\u2019s, and that it will share the same eight-core architecture. Its graphics cores, however, may jump from seven or eight to nine or 10. Come 2023, Gurman thinks Apple may release Pro and Max versions of the M2 chip \u2014 just like it did for the M1 chip \u2014 as well as announce an M3 chip.\nIt\u2019s been well over a year since Apple first announced its very first in-house M1 chip in November 2020, and several months since its M1 Pro and M1 Max debut. As Apple continues to distance itself from Intel silicon, it has a few other Macs on tap that are likely meant to shove any remaining Intel-powered devices out of its lineup. Gurman expects a larger iMac Pro with M1 Pro and M1 Max chip options to replace its current 27-inch iMac Pro, along with a smaller Mac Pro that comes \u201cwith the equivalent of either two or four M1 Max chips.\u201d And while the Mac Mini already comes with an M1 chip, Gurman expects it to get an upgraded M1 Pro option (in addition to an M2 variation).",

However, the difference is within a margin of error while at the same time, Intel's processors require dramatically more power.\nNow the company is reportedly aiming at a new processor that will beat Apple's 2021 chips by early 2024 at the latest.\nIt wasn't a rumour, it was their plan.

He says he got the slide \"between 8-9 months ago,\" so plans may have changed.\nIntel's slide says that it is about \"targeting Apple compete 14\" premium designs requiring high-touch OEM collaboration.\" And also that it is focused on how to \"maximise performance.\"\nTechnology site WCCFtech, which previously reported on Apple using Intel for a 2022 Mac Pro update, Intel plans a 320 EU iGPU based on Battleimage architecture.\nWCCFtech further says that according to the leaked slide, the forthcoming Arrow Lake-P (portable) processors will use 14 cores, while the desktop Arrow Lake-S will have up to 40 cores.",

        "title": "iOS 15.4 makes Shortcut automations way less annoying to use",
        "body": "Apple\u2019s upcoming iOS 15.4 software update appears to have quietly added a massive quality of life change for its Shortcuts app: the ability to disable the incredibly annoying notifications for personal automations that users have set up on their devices, as spotted by Fjorden developer Florian B\u00fcrger on Twitter.\nFor those who don\u2019t use Shortcuts regularly, the automations feature is one of the most useful and powerful tools that Apple gives its users access to. At its heart, it lets users set up basic \u201cif / then\u201d triggers for a variety of conditions on an iPhone, be it a specific time of day, arriving at a location, getting an email or text from a specific contact, joining a Wi-Fi network, tapping an NFC tag, opening an app, or when your phone hits a certain level of battery life.\nUsed properly, Shortcuts is incredibly useful, allowing things like disabling notifications when your Kindle app is open so you can read in peace, automatically turning on low power mode when your phone\u2019s battery dips below 50 percent, or disabling rotation lock when you open the Apple TV app so your shows enter full-screen mode properly.\nBut up until iOS 15.4, Apple had previously rendered the feature virtually unusable for common tasks by instituting mandatory notifications every single time the conditions were triggered. The new update fixes that, though, by adding a toggle that allows users to disable those notifications makes Apple\u2019s Shortcut automations vastly more usable for day-to-day tasks by allowing you to remove the spammy notifications that used to appear every time you triggered one.\nTo disable the notifications, simply tap on the automation and switch off the new \u201cnotify when run\u201d toggle that\u2019ll appear if you\u2019re running the latest iOS 15.4 beta. You\u2019ll have to do it for each notification, but once you\u2019ve set it up right, you\u2019ll never be bothered by the Shortcuts notification bar for your automations again.\nThe new \u201cnotify when run\u201d toggle to disable automation notifications in Shortcuts\nThere are a few caveats here, though: the new setting is only for Shortcuts automations, not all Shortcuts. That means that if you\u2019re using Shortcuts as a workaround for custom iOS icons, there\u2019s still no way to remove the pop-up banner when you open an app with that method, for example.",

Following the announcement ARM's CEO stepped down and will be replaced by Rene Haas.\nNvidia says it wasn't able to persuade regulators that the deal won't affect ARM's free licensing model and even offered to set up a separate entity that will hold the chip design licenses. As a result of the failed deal, SoftBank, which is the current owner of ARM, will get $1.25 billion break fee.\nSoftBank officially confirmed that it's now planing to make ARM public in an attempt to recoup part of the expected cash inflow from the failed sale.\nNew Arm CEO Haas said in an interview that the last year and a half was wrapped in uncertainty as the Nvidia-ARM acquisition was hanging in limbo. And despite the fact that ARM has never been better financial-wise, it is forced to let some of its employees go.\nPeople familiar with the matter say that the company has plans to go public in the US, although that hasn't been explicitly confirmed. SoftBank only said that it's planning to make ARM publicly traded without specifying more details at this point.\nSource 1 \u2022 Source 2",

The \u200ciPhone\u200c 6 Plus' sister phone, the \u200ciPhone\u200c 6, is not on the vintage list at this time as it was available for sale for a longer period of time.\nApple relaunched the \u200ciPhone\u200c 6 in 2017 as a midrange \u200ciPhone\u200c, and it was available for purchase until September 2018, so for that reason, it will be another two years or so before it is designated as a vintage product.\nThe \u200ciPhone\u200c 6 and 6 Plus were notable for being the first devices to offer support for Apple Pay and for marking the first year that Apple offered the \u200ciPhone\u200c in multiple size options. Apple has continued on with the multi-size release strategy since the \u200ciPhone\u200c 6 and 6 Plus launch.\nThe vintage products list features devices that Apple stopped distributing for sale more than five years ago and less than seven years ago.
