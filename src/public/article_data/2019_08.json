        "title": "Opinion | Apple should let people choose Spotify as their default music player",
        "body": "There was something of a mystery report this week.\nApple and Spotify are reportedly in talks over potentially allowing Spotify users to control music playback with Siri [\u2026] According to The Information, Spotify and Apple are discussing a \u201cplan\u201d that would \u201clet iPhone users tell Siri to play songs, playlists, and albums with voice commands.\u201d These conversations reportedly stem from new APIs in iOS 13 that make it possible for developers of audio apps to integrate with Siri.\nAs we noted, it\u2019s unclear why that would require talks, as the SiriKit APIs will allow Spotify or anyone else to take advantage of Siri for music requests. However, there is one rather more radical possibility\u2026\nSpotify may be asking Apple to allow iPhone and HomePod users to set Spotify as their default music player.\nAs things stand, SiriKit music commands would need to be prefixed or suffixed by an instruction to use the Spotify app. This would be something like:\nHey Siri, ask Spotify to play Camille. Hey Siri, play A Fine Frenzy on Spotify.\nWith short versions likely also possible, along the lines of:\nHey Siri, Spotify Ingrid Michaelson.\nOmit the Spotify part, and the device will default to Apple Music.\nWhich is fine if, like me, your preferred music service is Apple Music, with Spotify as a secondary option. In my case, I use Spotify for tango music and Apple Music for everything else. That\u2019s partly because Spotify has a better selection of tango music, and partly because I don\u2019t want tango to screw up my Apple Music recommendations.\nBut if Spotify is your preferred or only music service, you\u2019re forced to use somewhat clunky language. It would be much more convenient for Spotify users if they could simply select Spotify as their default music player. Having done that once, they could then use much simpler commands:\nHey Siri, play Janis Ian. Hey Siri, play my music. Hey Siri, play Discover Weekly.\nThat would benefit many of Apple\u2019s customers, but what about Apple itself? It might seem that Apple would be shooting itself in the foot to help a competing streaming service in this way.\nI\u2019d argue the opposite, however. I think Apple would be doing itself a favor on three counts, with almost no downside.\nFirst, those customers who prefer Spotify will be very happy with the change. Making customers happy is kind of customer service 101.\nSecond, extending this to HomePod would create a whole new customer base. At present, HomePod only really makes sense if you are an Apple Music subscriber. Sure, you can AirPlay from the Spotify app (though there are glitches with stereo pairs \u2014 a story for another day\u2026), but then you\u2019re giving up all the smart speaker benefits. Half the point of HomePod is you can just tell it what music to play.\nThird, this kind of gesture would help Apple with its various antitrust battles at present, including the one prompted by a Spotify complaint. The Cupertino company would be able to point to it as an example of providing competitors with a level playing field on its platform.\nAnd there\u2019s really no downside. This is not a change customers are going to make randomly. The only people who are going to go to the trouble of digging into the settings to change their default music player are those who are already loyal users of a competing service, be it Spotify, Tidal or whatever. Those people are not really potential Apple Music customers anyway.\nSo in my view, this would be a win-win: good for Apple, good for its customers. And if Apple doesn\u2019t do it, iOS 13 may include a workaround anyway.\nI keep meaning to verify this works but I believe if you were to delete the Music app, Siri\u2019s logic would then de facto fall back to Spotify (assuming Spotify was installed and had implemented the new API) without having to explicitly say it. https://t.co/XuMDh5HWjW \u2014 Benjamin Mayo (@bzamayo) August 13, 2019\nSo given people will already have the option, why not claim the credit by making it official?\nWhat\u2019s your take?

        "title": "Apple and Samsung earnings show most people don't want $1,000 phones",
        "body": "Chinese customers in an Apple store on Jan. 3, 2019, in Beijing, one day after Apple preannounced weak quarterly results that it attributed primarily to a sales slowdown in China. Lintao Zhang | Getty Images\nThe new Samsung Galaxy S10 CNBC\nThere are a few reasons why people aren't buying those premium phones like they used to. First, people are holding on to phones longer. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in February that iPhone owners are upgrading about once ever four years. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in January that \"customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in the past.\" Cook has also said macroeconomic factors come into play, particularly in places like China. There also haven't been compelling reasons for regular consumers to upgrade. Enthusiasts might want the latest and greatest phones each year, but most people are concerned with camera quality and battery life. Cameras are becoming a harder selling point, because phones launched over the past several years already have really good cameras.\nPhone makers know this. Apple launched its iPhone XR last September, a phone that excels at both camera quality and battery life but that starts at $749. The more expensive iPhone XS ($999) and XS Max ($1,099) have more colorful and brighter screens and even better cameras, but most consumers don't want to spend that much to get there. Meanwhile, Apple also still sells the iPhone 7 for $299 with a trade-in. Samsung's A Series phones attract the same audience who don't want to drop $999 on a high-end Galaxy S10+ (which is now on sale for $799.) Google recently launched its Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL which include excellent cameras at half the cost of the standard Pixel 3 ($799) and Pixel 3 XL ($899). Apple and Samsung are caught in a bit of a catch-22. They both build and sell really excellent phones that are so good people don't need or necessarily want to upgrade them to a new model just one or two years later. Samsung's Galaxy 8 and 9 series are still \"good enough.\" And most people would argue the same for Apple iPhones going back to even the iPhone 6, so long as you replace the battery.\nCNBC | Magdalena Petrova\nThere's no sign of this trend stopping \u2014 at least not until someone perfects folding phones or adds a \"must-have\" feature. Samsung will announce its highly anticipated Galaxy Note 10 on Aug. 7, which gives it a chance to put its best foot forward ahead of Apple's new iPhones in September. The Galaxy Note has a dedicated fan base, but it's also typically a very expensive phone. That means its success will depend on whether or not people upgrade. It's one reason Samsung has already teased the phone with compelling trade-in offers. Apple will face the same hurdles with its new iPhones expected this fall, but at least has two rapidly growing sources of revenue: its services business and wearables, the latter of which is now bringing in more revenue than Apple's iPad or Mac businesses. Those businesses were good enough in Apple's June quarter to send the stock up more than 3% on the Wednesday morning after earnings \u2014 despite the lackluster iPhone sales.",

        "body": "Samsung ads mocking iPhones are one of the company\u2019s stock in trades, including ones which made fun of the lack of a headphone jack in the iPhone 7 and iPhone X.\nThe Korean company has, however, followed Apple\u2019s example with its latest flagship device, the Galaxy Note 10. As 9to5Google observes, one of the notable changes from earlier models is that Samsung has dropped the headphone socket \u2026\nAfter a few months of leaks and rumors, Samsung today finally debuted the Galaxy Note 10 family at an event in New York City. For the first time ever, the Note line is getting two models, and it\u2019s also losing the headphone jack for the first time on a Samsung flagship.\nThat would be the same decision that Apple made three years ago with the launch of the iPhone 7, and which Samsung attacked at the time.\nIndeed, Samsung continued laughing at the idea of a premium device without a headphone socket a year later, when the iPhone X debuted.\nFollowing the official release of the iPhone X on Friday, Samsung is out today with a new ad for its Galaxy Note 8 flagship. The new ad slams the iPhone X\u2019s notch design, the lack of a headphone jack, and much more [\u2026] Samsung mocks the iPhone 7 for its lack of a headphone jack and lack of support for Qi-enabled wireless charging.\nAnd the company wasn\u2019t done. It ran another ad just last year, again making fun of the fact that the iPhone X lacked a headphone socket.\nSamsung debuted its new Apple-bashing ad \u201cIngenius\u201d series earlier this week, taking shots at the iPhone\u2019s LTE speeds. Now, the company has released three new ads as part of the same series [\u2026] Last but not least, Samsung takes an easy jab at the iPhone X\u2019s lack of a headphone jack, with an Apple Store employee explaining to a customer that they\u2019ll need a dongle to use their 3.5mm headphones with the iPhone X. And if they need to charge at the same time, they\u2019ll need a \u2018double dongle.\u2019\nOddly enough, as Business Insider spotted, these videos have now been quietly removed from YouTube.\nWe\u2019re sure this won\u2019t deter the company, however, and we can undoubtedly expect more Samsung ads mocking iPhones as it seeks to compete with future models.",

        "body": "Apple announced a new scheme that will allow independent repair shops to offer official servicing of iPhones that are out of warranty. The new Independent Repair Provider Program gives small repair businesses access to the same Apple-genuine parts, training, and resources as Apple authorized service providers.\nThe company said it trialed the initiative at 20 stores across North America, Europe, and Asia. It is today launching the program for the United States and will announce further regions in the future.\nFor end customers, it should ultimately offer more places for Apple users to get their iPhone repaired using official Apple parts. This is in addition to the June announcement that saw all Best Buy stores in the United States begin accepting Apple device repairs.\nApple says the program targets the most common out-of-warranty repairs. This presumably includes repairs such as cracked screen replacements or back glass replacements.\nPreviously to this announcement, Apple has mostly left independent repair businesses out in the cold. Enterprising businesses have instead resorted to buying Apple device parts from the grey market to conduct unofficial repairs.\nInterested independent businesses can apply for free. To qualify, the business will need to train its employees to become Apple-certified technicians. Again, Apple will offer this online training for free. If a company accepted into the program, they will have access to Apple parts and tooling at the same cost as Apple authorized resellers.",

        "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook has acquired $115 million worth of vested Apple stock this week, according to new filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As detailed in the filing, 560,000 restricted stock units have vested for Cook after AAPL exceeded performance expectations.\nFor 2019, Cook was granted 280,000 shares of AAPL for his continued employment at Apple, and another 280,000 shares for meeting performance requirements.\nThe filing with the SEC details those performance requirements:\nThe number of performance-based RSUs that vested was determined based on Apple\u2019s total shareholder return (TSR), relative to the other companies in the S&P 500 over a three-year period from August 25, 2016 through August 24, 2019. Apple\u2019s beginning value was calculated to be $108.01 (adjusted for dividends). Similarly, the ending value used for calculating TSR is the average closing price for the 20 trading days ending on August 24, 2019. Apple\u2019s ending value was calculated to be $216.24 (adjusted for dividends).\nCook was officially granted this stock award on Saturday after he successfully satisfied performance and time requirements laid out earlier. 294,840 shares were withheld by Apple for tax purposes, while the remaining 265,160 units were sold in three separate rounds on Monday. These shares are valued at nearly $115 million based on AAPL\u2019s price on Tuesday.\nGoing forward, Cook has 1,820,000 restricted stock units in this award \u2013 700,000 restricted stock units vest on August 24, 2021; the balance of 1,120,000 restricted stock units vests in two equal annual installments commencing August 24, 2020. This is contingent upon Cook staying at Apple, and meeting performance requirements.\nRead the full SEC filing here. Tim Cook last year received his full performance award as well.",

        "title": "iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max have all their specs seemingly leaked (up to 6GB of RAM, Pencil support)",
        "body": "After many months of rumors, purported leaks, and speculation, Apple will finally make the new trio of iPhones official on September 10. And today out of China comes a new report that seems to leak all of the new devices' specs. Before we go into the actual information, don't forget to take all of this with a healthy serving of salt - it's just an unconfirmed rumor at this point. That said, a lot of the stuff in it lines up with what we've heard in the past, and the rest is at least plausible.\niPhone 11\nThis is the successor to the iPhone XR, and hence Apple's entry-level option for late 2019. Like the XR, it will start at $749 in the US, and it will feature the exact same screen as its predecessor. The A13 chip is in, aided by 4GB of RAM. The front camera is 12 MP, and the Face ID sensor will be angled in a way that makes unlocking work at wider angles. So maybe even unlocking while the phone sits on a table will be possible.\nMoving on, the iPhone 11 gets a 3,110 mAh battery, which is a small bump up from the XR's 2,942 mAh cell. The device will have no 3D Touch, and won't support the Apple Pencil. On the back there's a dual 12 MP camera system, while support for both Wi-Fi 6 and reverse wireless charging is built-in. Storage versions are 64/256/512GB.\niPhone 11 Pro\nThis is the successor to the iPhone XS, and keeps the exact same OLED screen as that model. Like the iPhone 11, it has the A13 chip, newly angled Face ID, no 3D Touch, 12 MP front camera, reverse wireless charging, and Wi-Fi 6. Where it differs from the entry-level model is in that it has 6GB of RAM, triple 12 MP rear cameras (standard + ultrawide + telephoto), support for the Apple Pencil, and storage options starting at 128GB (with 256/512GB available too).\nThe iPhone 11 Pro has a 3,190 mAh battery, a huge step up from the 2,658 mAh cell in the XS. It will however keep its predecessor's pricing, starting at $999. It's said to sport a frosted glass design, which will be different from the iPhone 11's glass design, though it's not exactly clear how.\niPhone 11 Pro Max\nThis is the successor to the iPhone XS Max, it comes with the same screen, yet devoid of 3D Touch this year. It's got the same improved Face ID as the other iPhone 11 models, as well as the A13 chip, 12 MP front camera, reverse wireless charging and Wi-Fi 6 support. It shares the rear cameras with the iPhone 11 Pro, as well as the RAM amount at 6GB and the Apple Pencil support. It has a 3,500 mAh battery, quite the leap from the 3,174 mAh cell in its predecessor.\nStorage options will be identical to those for the iPhone 11 Pro, aka 128/256/512GB, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $1,099 just like the XS did last year. It also has the frosted glass design like the iPhone 11 Pro.\nAn 18W power adapter is said to ship in the box with all three models, and the cable will be Lighting at the phone end but USB-C at the brick end. As rumored countless times before, 5G support will only come to iPhones in 2020.\nSource (in Chinese) | Via",

        "body": "Apple and Spotify are reportedly in talks over potentially allowing Spotify users to control music playback with Siri. The talks come as Apple faces increasing antitrust scrutiny, some of which has been brought on by Spotify itself.\nAccording to The Information, Spotify and Apple are discussing a \u201cplan\u201d that would \u201clet iPhone users tell Siri to play songs, playlists, and albums with voice commands.\u201d These conversations reportedly stem from new APIs in iOS 13 that make it possible for developers of audio apps to integrate with Siri.\niOS 13 opens the SiriKit framework to third-party music, podcast, audiobook, and radio applications. This is seemingly what Spotify hopes to take advantage of in its efforts to allow users to control playback via Siri.\nIn fact, Spotify has gone as far as to drop some of the accusations it made towards Apple earlier this year. In March, Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission over the App Store and Apple Music.\nAt the time, Spotify launched a website detailing its complaints against Apple, writing that \u201cApple won\u2019t allow us to be on HomePod and they definitely won\u2019t let us connect with Siri to play your jams.\u201d As The Information notes, however, that language has now been removed:\nAs of Tuesday though, that language was no longer on the Spotify site, replaced by this sentence: \u201cOnly recently, Apple announced that it will let us connect with Siri to play your jams\u2026but fails to mention our name (\u2018I want to play [X] on Spotify\u2019) and your HomePod will default to Apple Music.\u201d\nThe report from The Information implies that there is some sort of special agreement being talked about between Apple and Spotify.

        "title": "Apple granted patent for Face ID on Macs, with smart auto-wake feature",
        "body": "We first reported on an Apple patent for Face ID on Macs back in 2017, before we knew what Apple would call the feature when it debuted in the iPhone X. That patent has today been granted.\nThe patent is for a more intelligent version of Face ID than is currently used on iPhones\u2026\nThe granted patent could use the Mac\u2019s camera to do two things. First, it would avoid timing-out into sleep mode when there\u2019s someone in front of the machine.\nMany computing devices are equipped with power saving features/modes intended to reduce power consumption when a user is not using the devices. Often, these power saving features are implemented though timers that count down a set amount of time from when the user last provides an input to the device. For example, a particular device may be configured to enter a sleep mode, or other mode that consumes less power than a fully operational mode, when a user has not provided input for five minutes. Occasionally, however, a device may enter the power saving features/modes while a user is still using the device. For example, the power saving features may be entered because the user failed to provide input within the time period set for the timer while reading content on the device, viewing a movie, or listening to music. Additionally, recovery from the power saving feature/mode may take time, may even require the user to enter credentials, and generally may be a nuisance to the user.\nThe second function is written in rather dense patenteze:\nOne embodiment may take the form of a method of operating a computing device to provide presence based functionality. The method may include operating the computing device in a reduced power state and collecting a first set of data from a first sensor or a group of sensors. Based on the first set of data, the computing device determines a probability or likelihood that an object is proximately located to the device. Additionally or alternatively, the computing device may make a hard decision as to the proximity of an object, for example, it may determine if the object is within a threshold distance of the computing device and, if the object is within the threshold distance and/or is likely proximity located to the device, the device activates a secondary sensor to collect a second set of data. Based on the second set of data, the device determines if the object is a person. If the object is a person, the device determines a position of the person relative to the computing device and executes a change of state in the computing device based on the position of the person relative to the computing device. If the object is not a person, the computing device remains in a reduced power state.\nMy reading of that and the accompanying illustrations is that the Mac can automatically wake and log you in, even if it is in sleep mode when you approach it.\nAlthough Apple uses the generic term \u2018computing device,\u2019 which could apply equally to an iPhone or iPad, the patent is illustrated with a drawing of a computer \u2014 and the functionality described fits well with Power Nap.\nPower Nap allows current Macs to perform certain background tasks while sleeping. The idea is that by doing things like updating your calendar, photos, notes, and so on, even when the Mac is in sleep mode, it will be ready for you to get to work as soon as you wake it.\nThis patent would appear to extend Power Nap\u2019s capabilities to using the camera to look out for someone approaching the Mac. If it detects a person, it then powers-up face-recognition functionality to see if it recognizes them as the owner of the Mac. If it does, it could fully wake and unlock the Mac.\nWith Face ID now supported on both iPhone and iPad, it seems a no-brainer that it will come soon to the Mac too. Whether this advanced functionality will be supported is impossible to tell: as we always note, Apple patents many things it never does. But this would certainly be a cool feature that could wow people at a Mac keynote, so I\u2019d say there\u2019s a decent chance that this one will make the cut.\nA separate patent referencing Face ID on Macs also illustrated the Touch Bar on an external keyboard.",

        "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook with U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting of the American Technology Council on June 19, 2017.\nPresident Donald Trump likes Apple CEO Tim Cook. But it's not necessarily because he's running a big and successful business. Rather, Trump said Cook calls him \"whenever there is a problem.\"\n\"That's why he's a great executive,\" Trump told reporters on Wednesday outside the White House. \"Because he calls me and others don't.\"\nLast week, Cook joined Trump for dinner at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Their warm relationship stands in stark contrast to Trump's position on other top executives, whom he frequently antagonizes.\n\"Others go out and hire very expensive consultants,\" Trump said. \"Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly.\"\nCook may be willing to reach out because Apple has a lot at stake when it comes to policy decisions. The company does the majority of its final device assembly in China, putting products such as the iPhone at risk when the Trump administration announces tariffs on Chinese imports. Trump has said he wants Apple to make its products in the U.S.\nApple's iPhone was in line to get a 10% tariff starting Sept. 1, before Trump announced a temporary reprieve for laptops and cellphones, pushing the start date for the duties back to Dec. 15.\nAccording to Trump, Cook recently argued that the 10% tariff would be unfair to Apple, especially compared with its primary competitor Samsung, which does most of its manufacturing in South Korea. Trump suggested on Wednesday that Cook directly influenced the administration's decision to waive the tariff on cellphones and laptops.\n\"The problem was that Samsung, a competitor, his competitor, wouldn't be paying tariffs, and Tim Cook would,\" Trump said. \"I gotta help him out short-term, because it's a great American company.\"\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        "title": "Apple considered releasing it's own credit card in the 90's but Steve Jobs didn't want to reject customers",
        "body": "Apple Card approvals levels are unusually high, according to a new report today, with some sub-prime borrowers having their applications accepted.\nThe report also says that Apple first considered launching its own credit card in the 1990s, but Steve Jobs was concerned about rejecting Apple customers\u2026\nCNBC cites both unnamed sources involved in the project, as well as customer reports.\nGoldman Sachs is casting a wide net for customers of its new credit card with Apple, approving some subprime borrowers for the product. The bank, which is in charge of deciding who gets the Apple Card, is accepting some applications from users with less-than-stellar credit scores, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Goldman began to make the card available to some Apple customers this week ahead of a broader rollout later this month. From the start, Apple wanted its bank partner to create a technology platform that would approve as many of its 100 million-plus US iPhone users as possible, within the bounds of regulations and responsible lending, according to the people. That\u2019s in line with the tech giant\u2019s desire to provide a good user experience for its customers.\nThe piece says that while there is no official definition of sub-prime, a credit score of less than 670 would typically be one indication. Yet some customers with lower scores are being accepted.\nOne new Apple Card customer, Ed Oswald, said his FICO score is about 620. The Reading, Pennsylvania-based copywriter said he had been using a subprime card from Merrick Bank. \u201cI was absolutely shocked I got it,\u201d Oswald said. \u201cI have a lot of collections from two or three years ago when I was in a really rough spot. When I heard it was with Goldman Sachs, I figured they were going for the high-income set.\u201d Oswald said Goldman is giving him a relatively modest credit limit of $750. He said his interest rate on the Apple Card, at 23.99%, is \u201ca lot lower\u201d than his other cards.\nExperian labels a credit score of 800-850 as exceptional, 740-799 as very good, and 670-739 as good. Anything lower would generally make it more difficult to get credit, with many cards declining applications below these levels.\nSteve Jobs wanted Apple Card approvals to be 100%\nApple has looked at the possibility of launching its own credit card on at least three occasions. One of those was in 2004, when the company considered an \u201ciTunes credit card,\u201d where cardholders would earn iPoints that could be used to buy music from iTunes. Former Apple creative director Ken Segall says that Steve Jobs was involved in the project, but was unable to agree terms with a partner bank.\nToday\u2019s report says that Jobs had previously looked at some kind of Apple Card in the late 1990s, but didn\u2019t like the idea of customers being refused.\nWhen Apple held discussions with Capital One about creating a joint card in the late 1990s, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs \u201chad an aversion\u201d to rejecting any of his customers for the card, according to a former executive of the bank. They tested a card, but didn\u2019t roll it out broadly, this person said.\nConcerns have been raised about the risks to both Goldman Sachs and Apple. Goldman is seemingly entering riskier-than-usual credit territory, while Apple risks reputational damage if it is perceived to be encouraging debt, especially to spend on its own products. The app does, however, encourage responsible borrowing and higher-than-minimum repayments by clearly showing the impact of different repayment levels on the interest charged.\nRelated stories:",

But on iOS, Chrome and other third-party browsers rely on WebKit due to restrictions imposed by Apple\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines (Section 2.5.6).\nIntelligent Tracking Protection\nPublishers and companies rely heavily on online tracking \u2014 i.e. collecting (anonymized) data about a user\u2019s activity on the web \u2014 to keep tabs on your every move as you hop from one site to the other.\nThe <3 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

By the way, we *just* announced the WebKit Tracking Prevention Policy: https://t.co/jo5MPkNAAs \u2014 John Wilander (@johnwilander) August 14, 2019\nWhile this is typically used for targeted advertising, the implications go beyond just serving relevant ads in that it allows marketers to create detailed dossiers about your interests \u2014 resulting in significant loss of privacy.\nThis involves the use of cookies, tracking pixels, link decoration, browser and device fingerprinting, and other adtech-based navigational tracking methods intended to amass browsing activities and build elaborate profiles of web users.\nApple, for its part, began to crack down on web-tracking two years ago with Intelligent Tracking Protection (ITP). The technology aims to limit advertisers\u2019 cross-site tracking on iOS and macOS Safari browsers, at the same time, measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns on the web without compromising on your privacy.\nThe anti-tracking policy\nViewed in that light, the new policy is an extension of this privacy-by-design paradigm. It seeks to prevent all forms of covert tracking methods outlined above, failing which it will ask for user\u2019s informed consent before allowing tracking.\nApple warns that parties trying to circumvent its anti-tracking tech in Safari will be treated \u201cwith the same seriousness as exploitation of security vulnerabilities,\u201d and that it \u201cmay add additional restrictions without prior notice.\u201d\nThis is a big deal \u2014 @webkit releases a Tracking Prevention Policy outlining the types of tracking practices that are (or will be) blocked in WebKit (and thus Safari). https://t.co/E0SKOx6rqp \u2014 Steven Englehardt (@s_englehardt) August 15, 2019\nAt the same time, the Cupertino-based tech giant acknowledged it will \u201ctry to limit unintended impact\u201d of its anti-tracking methods, particularly on practices that could be affected because \u201cthey rely on techniques that can also be used for tracking,\u201d such as \u201cLike\u201d buttons, third-party sign-on, and bot detection.\nIt is, however, not immediately clear if paywall detection methods employed by publishers will be considered forbidden in this context.\nPrivacy trumps all\n\u201cWhen faced with a tradeoff, we will typically prioritize user benefits over preserving current website practices,\u201d the WebKit engineering team said.\nApple is not the first company to go after abusive tracking methods \u2014 the company notes its anti-tracking methods were inspired by Mozilla\u2019s anti-tracking policy. But with Safari being the default browser on all Apple devices, the development could tip the scales in its favor.\nThe policy enforcement also comes at a time when use of ad-blockers is at its peak, with privacy-focused web browser Brave registering a 1,200 percent increase in verified publishers using its Brave Rewards program since July last year.\nBrave blocks ads by by default, but allows its users to earn BAT tokens if they choose to accept ads that are provided by the company.\nBut by equating circumvention of anti-tracking measures with a security vulnerability, Apple has taken its efforts to guarantee user privacy up a notch.\nWhile a lot of it will depend how the policy is enforced, you can bet it will force advertisers and other browser makers \u2014 including Google\u2019s widely used Chrome \u2014 to rethink their approach. And that can only be a win for privacy.",

        "title": "On August 24, 2011 SteveJobs announced his resignation as Apple CEO, six weeks before his death. AppleInsider takes a look back at how Tim Cook emerged as his successor.",
        "body": "The road to Steve Jobs' resignation, and the rise of Tim Cook as his successor\nIf you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nOn August 24, 2011 Apple cofounder Steve Jobs announced his resignation as Apple CEO, six weeks before his death. Tim Cook now seems to have been his obvious successor, but back then, he was an unexpected and even controversial choice.\nSteve Jobs' resignation followed a previous leave of absence from the company starting in January 2011, during which Cook had served as acting CEO. His stepping down was an unmistakable end of an era for the company, and a very different departure from the first time Jobs left Apple, in 1985.\nThe resignation followed a multi-year saga in which the executive was widely assumed to be in failing health. But, Jobs was not always forthright about the exact nature and severity of his illness.\nThe first battle\nJobs was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer as long before as the fall of 2003. In an extreme example of Jobs' stubborn nature, he first fought his disease with alternative medicine, as well as a special diet.\nEventually, in the summer of 2004, Jobs underwent a surgery, known as a \"Whipple procedure,\" that successfully removed the tumor. As Apple's Chief Operating Officer at the time, Tim Cook assumed Jobs' duties on an interim basis during his leave and subsequent recuperation.\nJobs told Apple employees about the cancer shortly before his surgery, and disclosed the diagnosis and surgery after they happened. That information, and the rumors beforehand, had left many inside and outside of Apple, wondering about the company's future.\nEven so, Jobs didn't address the cancer battle at length in any public way until his now famous commencement address at Stanford University in June of 2005.\n\"About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer,\" Jobs told the Stanford graduates. \"I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.\"\n\"My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die,\" added Jobs. \"It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.\"\nIn an example, perhaps, of his famed \"reality distortion field,\" Jobs' speech wasn't exactly an accurate depiction of the timeline, front-dating his diagnosis and leaving out the period of several months in which he used alternative treatments.\nDespite that prediction of three to six months, Jobs actually appeared to recover well over the next couple of years. He recovered sufficiently that attention on his health lessened, though it never quite faded completely.\nHealth questions\nThe World Wide Developers Conference in 2006 was the first of several public appearances that caused whispers about whether Jobs was unwell. His appearance was yet to clearly show illness, but he was noticeably thinner than at the previous WWDC.\nPlus some, including Forbes magazine, commented that his performance on stage wasn't as high-energy as it normally was at such events.\n\"Is Steve Jobs ill?,\" Forbes publisher and columnist Rich Karlgaard asked, noting Jobs' gaunt appearance, as well as the grim survival rates for the type of cancer he'd battled just a couple of years earlier. \"Apple without Steve Jobs is unthinkable... And we really, really hope the answer to our headline question is no.\"\nKarlsgaard's column was perhaps the first to raise a question with which journalists and ethicists would wrestle for the next few years, in regards to Jobs.\nEven Karlgaard himself in that first article questioned when it is responsible or not to speculate about the state of a public person's health. Karlgaard believed that ordinarily, Jobs should be given his privacy \u2014 but also pointed out how many thousands of families depended on Steve Jobs righ then.\nAfter that, the Jobs health rumors were at a low simmer for most of 2007, but they came back in a big way the following year, when Jobs showed up at the 2008 WWDC, now looking positively gaunt.\nAn Apple spokesperson responded to questions about his appearance by telling the press that Jobs was suffered from \"a common bug.\"\nThat denial failed to quiet doubts, leading to Jobs' infamous phone call with the The New York Times' Joe Nocera.\nCulture of Secrecy\nNocera, then a Times business columnist, wrote a piece on July 26, 2008, on what he called \"Apple's culture of secrecy.\" He began by calling out Jobs for fudging the timeline of his diagnosis in the Stanford speech and omitting the part about spending nine months trying to beat the tumor with a special diet.\nThen, he noted that the party line from Apple, rather than including any denials about cancer, was to simply state that, \"Steve's health is a private matter.\"\nConsequently, Nocera went on to accuse Apple of being less than forthright with its investors and the public. He wrote that \"Apple simply can't be trusted to tell the truth about its chief executive.\"\nOnce hearing that Nocera was writing about the matter, Jobs decided to call him.\n\"You think I'm an arrogant [expletive] who thinks he's above the law,\" said Jobs. \"I think you're a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong.\"\nJobs went on to tell Nocera, off the record, what his exact health problems were. Nocera was later able to say that the issues were \"a good deal more than a common bug,\" but not life-threatening and not a recurrence of cancer.\n\"After he hung up the phone, it occurred to me that I had just been handed, by Mr. Jobs himself, the very information he was refusing to share with the shareholders who have entrusted him with their money,\" Nocera wrote.\nThat September, 2008, at an iPod event, Jobs poked fun at the controversy by flashing the Mark Twain quote \"reports of my death are greatly exaggerated\" on screen behind him.\nHormone imbalance - and absence\nYet Jobs' health came to the forefront once again the following January, when he didn't deliver his customary address at the Macworld Expo.\nIn a letter dated January 5, 2009, Jobs stated that he had been diagnosed with a \"hormone imbalance,\" which was the reason for his extreme weight loss. He said he would undergo treatment but remain as CEO.\n\"So now I've said more than I wanted to say, and all that I am going to say, about this,\" wrote Jobs.\nHowever, just nine days later, Jobs wrote another letter in which he disclosed that \"during the past week I have learned that my health-related issues are more complex than I originally thought.\"\nHe therefore announced a medical leave of absence that would extend until June. Once again, Tim Cook would be stepping in as acting CEO.\nJobs positioned the announcement as an attempt to avoid distractions for the company and \"allow everyone at Apple to focus on delivering extraordinary products.\"\nIt didn't work, especially not with Apple's board of directors. They weren't pleased at Jobs hiding his health issues, not from the public \u2014 and from them.\nMuch later, Jerome York, then a board member, told the Wall Street Journal at the time that he was \"disgusted\" that Jobs hadn't been more honest about the health disclosures. He said that he had even considered resigning from the board over it.\nFor unknown reasons, though, the Journal did not report this until after York died the next year.\nIn April 2009, Jobs underwent a liver transplant, although this fact also wasn't disclosed until much later. Nor was the fact that Cook had offered to donate part of his own liver to help Jobs, an offer that was refused.\nSteve Jobs did not appear at the WWDC in June 2009, but he did return to work at Apple as scheduled, later that month.\nHe then appeared on stage, for the first time in nearly a year, in September, at an event to introduce a new line of iPods.\n\"I'd like to thank everyone in the Apple community for the heartfelt support I got,\" he said. \"It really meant a lot. And I'd also like to especially thank Tim Cook and the entire executive team at Apple. They really rose to the occasion and ran the company very ably in that difficult period.\"\nFollowing that, the year 2010 was associated more with the launch of the first iPad and the iPhone 4. There was very little news about Jobs' health, but, again, the issue never quite went away.\nThe Last Leave\nOn January 17, 2011, Jobs announced that he would once again be taking a medical leave of absence.\n\"At my request, the board of directors has granted me a medical leave of absence so I can focus on my health,\" Jobs wrote in a letter. \"I will continue as CEO and be involved in major strategic decisions for the company.\"\nHe once again placed Cook in charge in his stead, but unlike his 2009 leave, he did not announce a planned return date.\n\"I love Apple so much and hope to be back as soon as I can,\" Jobs added. \"In the meantime, my family and I would deeply appreciate respect for our privacy.\"\nJobs would make his last public appearance not at an Apple event, but rather a Cupertino City Council meeting on June 7, discussing the plans for Apple's new headquarters.\nThe Final day\n\"I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know.\" read Jobs' letter, on August 24, 2011. Unfortunately, that day has come.\"\nHe went on to \"strongly recommend\" that the board implement its succession plan, with Cook ascending to the CEO chair.\n\"I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role,\" Jobs said. \"I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.\"\nJobs, despite his leave, reportedly worked an entire day at Apple's headquarters and attended a board meeting on the day of his resignation.\nSteve Jobs died on October 5, 2011. He was 56 years old.\nLessons from a health crisis\nFollowing Jobs' death, and especially after the publication of Walter Isaacson's authorized biography and some other books in the ensuing years, a few things became clear. Jobs, for much of the last five years of his life, was much more ill than he had let on.\nAccording to the book, Apple's board, whether to protect Jobs or its own stock price, either never pushed Jobs to go public about the severity of condition, or actively covered it up.\nThe Isaacson book also revealed more about the timeline of the late CEO's illness. It painted a more complete picture of Jobs' refusal to use traditional medical treatment when he was first diagnosed, and how his family and friends, including Intel's Andy Grove, ultimately talked him into surgery.\nJobs admitted to the biographer that he had regrets about his original course of alternative treatment. To this day, it's still not clearly established exactly when Jobs' cancer recurred, or if it was ever in remission at all.\nSteve Jobs accomplished a lot while fighting cancer, likely in immense physical pain a great deal of time. And, he was right about Apple's brightest days being ahead of it, because he set the company up for success.\nRather than having any collapse after his death, the company has thrived, even boomed. And in his time as CEO, Cook has more than lived up to Jobs' desire that Apple's most innovative days\" were to come.\nThe obvious choice\n\"The last two weeks for me have been the saddest of my life by far,\" said Tim Cook at Apple's memorial service for Steve Jobs in October 2011.\nAs Jobs had said in his resignation letter, Cook did take over permanently. While he now seems the clear choice, however, it truly wasn't so certain at the time.\nThree years before Jobs's death, Fortune magazine quoted Cook addressing the idea that he could take over Apple.\n\"Come on, replace Steve? No. He's irreplaceable,\" Cook had said then. \"That's something people have to get over. I see Steve there with gray hair in his 70s, long after I'm retired.\"\nThen, too, there was Jony Ive. Whether he might want to become CEO or not, Ive had immense authority at Apple \u2014 - because Steve Jobs arranged it.\n\"[Jony Ive] has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me,\" Steve Jobs had said according to Isaacson. \"There's no one who can tell him what to do, or to butt out. That's the way I set it up.\"\nHe apparently set up other things, though, but in typical Apple fashion this was kept secret. Any large corporation will always have worked out who can replace key figures when necessary, and Apple was no exception.\nBut unlike most firms, Apple refused to even reveal that there was a succession plan until it was time to enact it.\nHowever, Apple's habit of secrecy does not always help as much as it seems to think. Just as Steve Jobs's health concerns had raised questions among shareholders, so had Apple's apparent lack of a succession plan. There was even a demand from groups including the Central Laborer's Pension Fund that Apple make a plan and publish it.\nBloomberg's Eric Jackson argued, though, that there was no evidence to say Apple hadn't made its plans. The financial magazine even suggested that \"Steve Jobs's hottest app may be [his] succession plan\". (Article requires subscription.)\nThe plan wasn't confirmed at all until that resignation letter mentioned its recommendation that Cook become CEO. We still don't know what else was in the plan \u2014 but there were changes coming that may have been part of it.\nHowever, there were also pressures from outside the company, pressures from people who did not believe Tim Cook could take over from Jobs. Apple's stock price and value took a dip around this time, too, though that is arguably because the company wasn't releasing major new projects.\nThen it did \u2014 and unfortunately not very well. When Apple Maps was released with significant problems in 2012, Cook apologized publicly. \"We are extremely sorry for the frustration and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better,\" he said in a public email that has since been removed from Apple's site.\nPerhaps one of the things Apple did to make Maps better was to drop the man who introduced it. Scott Forstall left Apple a few weeks later on October 29, 2012.\nForstall had been a long-standing Apple employee and at times had been predicted to become CEO one day.\nHis departure was such big news that it rather overshadowed another one that was announced on the same day. John Browett, head of Apple retail, was out just a couple of months after Cook had originally hired him.\nBrowett had been a replacement for Ron Johnson, who had previously overseen the launch and huge growth of Apple Stores, but who had now moved to JC Penney \u2014 which remains in trouble to this day, along with a large portion of American retail other than Apple stores.\nAfter deciding Browett wasn't the right replacement, Cook took added the head of retail duties to his own workload.\nCook retained operational control of Apple's retail arm until he hired Angela Ahrendts away from fashion firm Burberry in 2014. With Apple's fortune, now assured success and giant retail operation, it was probably an easier task to persuade Ahrendts to join Apple than it had been for Jobs to convince Cook.\nHe also radically changed Apple's management team. Eddy Cue, Craig Federighi, Jony Ive and Bob Mansfield were all Apple stalwarts who took on extra or new responsibilities.\nEach of their roles has evolved since but this was the formation of the Apple team that for next many years, we would come to regularly see presenting at WWDC and Special Event events.\nCulture\nThose events have since changed radically because of the impact of COVID. With the move away from in-person events to exceptionally well-produced video presentations, Apple has greatly expanded its pool of presenters.\nIt's also diversified the very nature of its entire business. In terms of specific technology products, Apple has pressed ahead, and Cook has overseen, devices such as the Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod and more.\nAt the same time, however, it has also introduced Apple TV+, Apple Card, and Apple Pay. Apple has gone from the technology company Jobs knew, to one that is at least as lead by services as it is devices.\nCook has also changed the role of Apple's CEO, or at least he has worked to be a different CEO than Jobs. A reportedly highly private man, he nonetheless chose in 2014 to publicly come out as gay.\n\"If hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it's worth the trade-off with my own privacy,\" Cook wrote in Bloomberg.\nCook also said that he plans to give away all of this wealth, once he's paid for the college education of his nephew, and he has been steadily doing exactly that.\nIn August 2018, for instance, he donated approximately $5 million worth of Apple shares to an undisclosed charity.\nWe may never know exactly what donations he has made to where, but more recently he has begun being open about there being life after Apple. Specifically, he was asked about whether he would still be in charge a decade from then.\n\"Ten more years?\" Cook said to New York Times journalist Kara Swisher, in his interview. \"Probably not. But I can tell you that I feel great right now and the date is not in sight. But ten more years is a long time \u2014 and probably not ten more years.\"\nSwisher asked what plans he had for after he leaves, and what he might do once Apple is behind him.\n\"I don't have a clue because I love this company so much, that it is hard to imagine my life without it,\" he said. \"And so I don't think I will know that until after I'm not here. Because I think I will run so fast that I'll never really think about it until I'm not running anymore. Does that make any sense?\"\nThe next chapter for Apple\nRegardless of when Cook does decide to leave, Apple is going to be going through more changes in the next few years. It's facing an unprecedented number of antitrust investigations, some of which are already forcing the company to make changes to its App Store.\nDespite most of these challenges having arisen since Jobs's death, Apple contests them all by using the same playbook it always has. Apple says that everything it does is done with users' privacy in mind, and that is something Jobs used to argue for as well.\nBut Tim Cook has also made it clear that whatever App Store changes are forced on Apple, the company is still going to get its commission \u2014 no matter what.\nSteve Jobs reportedly criticized Tim Cook for not being a \"product person\".",

Annual subscriptions will also be offered at a discount, with the US subscription costing $69.99 per year.\nAn extra bundle will also be offered, combining Disney+ with ESPN+ and an advertising-supported Hulu subscription, at $12.99 per month.",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s new credit card comes with forced arbitration\u2014here\u2019s how to opt out",
        "body": "Apple's new credit card is rolling out in stages to interested users (I got mine on Monday) and the early reception is generally positive. The card's primary draw isn't in its benefits, which are perfectly fine but not outstanding by any metric. Instead, the card's strength is in its tight vertical integration with the Apple technology ecosystem and the (hopefully) increased security one gains by moving to using tokenized payments for (most of) your point-of-sale transactions. The card otherwise has a lot in common with other traditional credit cards\u2014and, unfortunately, one of those things is the Apple Card's forced arbitration provision.\nBriefly, this means that there is language in the Apple Card/Goldman Sachs' customer agreement that requires customers to give up their right to file lawsuits against Goldman or Apple, either individually or as members of a class , and instead forces customers into accepting binding arbitration to resolve disputes. Although binding arbitration is frequently defended by proponents as being faster and less expensive than lawsuits, arbitration heavily favors companies over consumers in disputes. The arbitrator or arbitrators are typically chosen by the company engaging in arbitration and tend to favor the company's interests; studies show that in the vast majority of cases, the odds of winning are heavily on the company's side . The bias in arbitration outcomes has been taken advantage of by numerous companies\u2014including companies we regularly cover \u2014to engage in some truly shady dealings\n(It's not just consumers who get shafted by arbitration\u2014many companies force their own employees into mandatory arbitration, too, though a number of employers are beginning to walk back the practice.)\nTell them to get stuffed\nHOW TO REJECT THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION\nYOU MAY REJECT THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION BY CONTACTING US USING MESSAGES, CALLING US, OR WRITING TO US, AND STATING THE FOLLOWING: (I) YOUR NAME; (II) THE EMAIL ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT; (III) THE ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT; AND (IV) THAT YOU ARE EXERCISING YOUR RIGHT TO REJECT THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION (A \"REJECTION NOTICE\"). YOUR REJECTION NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED WITHIN 90 DAYS AFTER THE OPENING OF YOUR ACCOUNT. IF YOUR REJECTION NOTICE COMPLIES WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS, THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU, EXCEPT FOR ANY CLAIMS SUBJECT TO PENDING LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION AT THE TIME YOU SEND YOUR REJECTION NOTICE. ANY REJECTION NOTICE THAT COMPLIES WITH THIS PROVISION WILL APPLY TO BOTH US AND APPLE. REJECTION OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL NOT AFFECT YOUR OTHER RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION OR THIS AGREEMENT.\nFortunately, most arbitration clauses have a way to opt out if you're willing to look hard enough, and the Apple Card's policy is one of the easier ones to escape from. The agreement explains how to snatch your rights back from Apple and Goldman Sachs:\nYou can opt out of the arbitration agreement within 90 days of opening your Apple Card account, and you can do so by calling Apple at 877-255-5923 or by writing a letter to Lockbox 6112, P.O. Box 7247, Philadelphia, PA 19170-6112. Or you can do what I did and opt out directly from the Wallet app by using its built-in chat function. Tapping on the icon launches the Messages app, and opting out takes about 30 seconds:\nAdvertisement\nWhile I'm clearly against mandatory arbitration\u2014my belief is that it's a blatantly anti-consumer and anti-employee tactic with zero practical upsides for anyone other than the businesses pushing for it\u2014it's worth reading about the practice yourself and making an informed decision (though finding non-biased pro-arbitration literature that lays out a compelling use-case for consumers and employees is a challenge somewhat on the order of finding fact-based, anti-vaccine data). As LeVar Burton used to say, don't just take my word for it\u2014make your own informed choice.",

        "title": "Report: Apple to provide 'pre-jailbroken' iPhones to researchers, launch macOS bug bounty program",
        "body": "Apple is reportedly set to provide security researchers with unique iPhone models that would allow them to more easily find weaknesses in iOS. Forbes reports that Apple will make this announcement at the Black Hat security conference later this week.\nAccording to the report, the iPhones will be given to security researchers that participate in Apple\u2019s invite-only bug bounty program. Through this program, researchers are rewarded for the iOS bugs they disclose to Apple. Apple first promised the availability of such iPhones in 2016.\nWhat would be different about these iPhones compared to consumer models?\nOne source with knowledge of the Apple announcement said they would essentially be \u201cdev devices.\u201d Think of them as iPhones that allow the user to do a lot more than they could on a traditionally locked-down iPhone. For instance, it should be possible to probe pieces of the Apple operating system that aren\u2019t easily accessible on a commercial iPhone. In particular, the special devices could allow hackers to stop the processor and inspect memory for vulnerabilities.\nDespite that level of openness, these iPhones will won\u2019t be quite as unlocked as the devices seeded to internal Apple developers and members of its security team. For example, security researchers using these devices will likely not be able to decrypt iPhone firmware.\nThis program might also reduce the number of leaked developer devices, which have often been sold on the black market.\nElsewhere, the report claims that Apple is also set to launch a Mac bounty program. This would be similar to the iOS bug bounty, and reward security researchers for the vulnerabilities they discover in macOS.\nBack in February, a security researcher detailed a macOS exploit to access Keychain passwords, but refused to share details with Apple due to its lack of a bug bounty program for macOS. Ultimately the researcher did share details of the vulnerability with Apple, despite the company not having publicly announcing a bug bounty program.\nWe\u2019ll likely learn more about both Apple\u2019s new pre-jailbroken device program, as well as the macOS bug bounty at the Black Hat conference this week. Apple\u2019s head of security and engineering, Ivan Krsti\u0107, is set to give a talk on Thursday.",

        "body": "Ming-Chi Kuo today released a report claiming that Apple will bring back Touch ID fingerprint recognition to its iPhones starting in 2021. The analyst said that he believes Apple will release an iPhone with both Face ID and under-display Touch ID fingerprint biometrics.\nKuo says that over the next 18 months, a lot of technical issues will be resolved which will enable Apple to deliver the high-tier experience it strives for in its devices.\nTF Securities Ming-Chi Kuo sees the facial recognition and fingerprint recognition technologies as complementary and believes Apple will want to unify the experiences. Apple has been filing patents on under-display fingerprint recognition technologies which suggests Apple is still pursuing a Touch ID future (without the button).\nHowever, current technological challenges to launching fingerprint-under-display components include power consumption, size of the sensing area, thickness of the sensing module, and the production yield rate of the lamination process.\nKuo says he believes these issues will be addressed in the next year or so, opening the door for Apple to design into the 2021 iPhone.\nKuo says it is likely that Apple will use a variant of Qualcomm\u2019s ultrasonic fingerprint-under-display system, which enables the user to place their finger on a large area of the screen to be scanned.\nThe analyst also said that if the Apple Watch gained biometrics in the future, an under-display fingerprint scanner is the more likely route than a Face ID facial recognition camera. However, he does not make any claims about whether that is actually in the works.\nLast night, TF Securities also published another report from Kuo detailing the impending tariff impact on Apple\u2019s product lineup. Apple will likely absorb any trade war tariffs in the short term as it looks to diversify production beyond China as soon as next year.",

        "body": "With Apple Card rolling out to more users, we\u2019ve learned additional details about things like cashback, approval odds, and more. Now, it seems that iPhone Upgrade Program payments fall into the 3% Apple Card cashback category, even though they aren\u2019t billed through Apple.\nAs a quick refresher, you get 3% cashback on Apple Card purchases made through Apple. This includes things like the App Store and iTunes, Apple Music, hardware purchases, iCloud, and more. Apple Pay purchases from any retailer earn 2%, while everything else earns 1%.\nGet 3% back on everything you buy from Apple, whether you buy it at an Apple Store, apple.com, the App Store, or iTunes. That includes games, in\u2011app purchases, and services like your Apple Music subscription and iCloud storage plan.\nGet 2% back every time you buy something using Apple Pay. That\u2019s in every category, with no limits. Imagine all the things you use a credit card for every day \u2014 at Target, Walgreens, Lyft. You\u2019ll get 2% back on just about everything.\nIf you happen to come across a store, website, or app that doesn\u2019t take Apple Pay yet, use your titanium Apple Card to get 1% of those purchases back in the form of Daily Cash.\nInterestingly, it appears as if iPhone Upgrade Program monthly payments fall into that 3% category. Even though these loans are generally billed through Citizens One Bank, Apple Card counts the payments as an Apple purchase, and thus gives you 3% cashback.\nWhether or not the iPhone Upgrade Program would count as an Apple purchase was one of the early questions we had about Apple Card. It\u2019s nice to see that this is something Apple seemingly considered ahead of launch.\nThis means every time your monthly iPhone Upgrade Program payment is processed, you\u2019ll get 3% cashback deposited onto your Apple Cash card. Apple Pay cashback is made available everyday through Apple Cash.\nAs Apple winds down its partnership with Barclaycard, there\u2019s speculation that it might also soon offer special financing for Apple purchases through Apple Card. This would be a nice addition for Apple Card holders coming over from the long-running Barclaycard Apple rewards partnership.\nThanks, Tyler!\nRelated stories:",

        "title": "AAPL stock falls as Trump announces new round of tariffs that could hit Apple products",
        "body": "President Donald Trump announced this afternoon that the United States will place a 10% tariff on another $300 billion worth of goods imported from China. Following that news, AAPL stock is down over 2%. The company has previously said that such tariffs could affect \u201call of Apple\u2019s major products.\u201d\nThis new round of tariffs will begin on September 1, targeting the $300 billion worth of US imports from China not included in the previous round of 25% tariffs. Apple has largely escaped the effects of tariffs so far, with no Apple products (except some accessories) included in the imports currently being penalized.\nAs detailed by CNBC, however, this next round of 10% tariffs has the potential to affect all of Apple\u2019s major products. In June, Apple sent a letter to US trade representative Robert Lighthizer, saying that proposed tariffs would affect \u201call of Apple\u2019s major products\u201d and \u201cresult in a reduction of Apple\u2019s US economic contribution.\u201d\nThe letter was sent in regards to the aforementioned 25% tariffs, and Apple products ended up not being included. At this point, it\u2019s not clear which Apple products would be affected by the new round of 10% tariffs, and it\u2019s possible that Apple could again make it through unscathed.\nTariffs going into effect on September 1 would significantly affect Apple\u2019s release of the iPhone 11 and other new devices just several weeks later. On Trump\u2019s announcement today, AAPL stock is down over 2%, erasing the gains it made earlier this week following its Q3 earnings report.\nThis news comes as Apple recently requested tariff waivers for Mac Pro parts and accessories made in China. Trump, however, took to Twitter to say that Apple would not receive any such waivers, and instead encouraged the company to manufacture its products in the United States.\nDuring Apple\u2019s earnings call on Tuesday, Tim Cook said that Apple wants to keep making the Mac Pro in the US, and is investing in the capacity to do so. This is despite previous reports that claimed Apple had reached an agreement with Quanta to assemble the Mac Pro in China.",

Sign up here.\nApple is offering hackers up to $1 million to hack into their iPhones and tell the company how they did it.\nThe bounty, which was announced by the iPhone-maker at the annual Black Hat hacker convention in Las Vegas on Thursday, is the company\u2019s biggest ever -- in fact, it\u2019s five times bigger than its previous largest payout.\nIn the past, Apple limited its bug bounty program to a restricted list of friendly hackers, but it has now opened up the reward to everyone. It will only pay out the top prize for a very specific hack: Hackers will have to show that they can gain remote access to the very core of Apple\u2019s iOS software without needing the target, the phone\u2019s user, to take any action.\nAdvertisement\nBug bounty programs, in which companies invite hackers to find vulnerabilities in their systems, have become increasingly popular in recent years as a way of preventing criminals from finding and exploiting those flaws first.\nSuch vulnerabilities in the world\u2019s most popular smartphone are highly prized on the vulnerability market, and Apple\u2019s $1 million reward is in line with what hackers would likely be paid for uncovering such a bug.\nPrivate companies such as Israel\u2019s secretive cybersecurity company NSO Group, as well as government agencies, have paid as much as $2 million for a tool that can remotely access an iPhone.\nRepressive governments have been increasingly eager to find ways of monitoring the digital lives of dissidents, journalists and political opponents. In recent years, a lucrative grey market dominated by shadowy companies selling tools to do just that has exploded, and Apple\u2019s new $1 million bounty is a way of preventing those tools from falling into the wrong hands.\nIt has been reported that Saudi dissidents living abroad, including well-known YouTube comic and satirist Ghanem Almasarir, were targeted with an iPhone spying tool created by NSO Group prior to the brutal torture and murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nRecently, a group of hackers working for Google\u2019s Project Zero program uncovered a cache of flaws in Apple\u2019s software, which would allow hackers to gain access to your phone simply by sending you a message.\nBut the Google hackers quietly shared the details with Apple, which fixed the flaws before the the details were made public, which would allow hacker to take advantage of them.",
