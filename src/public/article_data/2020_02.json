        "title": "Larry Tesler, the Apple employee who invented cut, copy, paste, dies at 74",
        "body": "Larry Tesler, a pioneering computer scientist who worked at Apple from 1980 to 1997 and created computerized cut, copy and paste, died Monday at the age of 74.\nTesler served as VP of AppleNet and Apple\u2019s Advanced Technology Group. During his time at Apple, he played a key role in the development of products ranging from the Lisa to the Newton MessagePad.\nAnd that was just the tip of the iceberg when it came to his contribution to computing.\nThis post contains affiliate links. Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items.\nLarry Tesler\u2019s route into computing\nTesler was a fascinating figure in the history of personal computing. He perfectly encapsulated the mix of hippie and high-tech culture that helped create Apple as a company. (Remember how Steve Jobs began his career as a bearded, bare-footed hippie?)\nBorn in New York in 1945, Tesler studied computer science at Stanford University. For a time he worked at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. In the 1960s, Tesler participated in antiwar demonstrations and taught classes at San Francisco\u2019s Free University. One of these, in the autumn of 1968, was titled, \u201cHow to End the IBM Monopoly.\u201d Most of the people who turned up were IBM employees.\nIn 1970, Tesler helped found a hippie commune in rural Oregon, before being offered a job at the legendary R&D facility Xerox PARC. The person who offered him the job, Alan Kay, also later worked at Apple.\nTesler was passionate about something called modeless computing, meaning a type of computing (now taken for granted) in which the user doesn\u2019t have to switch constantly between different input states. His Dodge Valiant bore a customized license plate reading \u201cNO MODES.\u201d He regularly wore a T-shirt warning colleagues not to \u201cMode Me In.\u201d And his Twitter handle was @nomodes.\nHe also invented cut, copy and paste: a standard piece of today\u2019s computer interfaces.\nTesler met Steve Jobs\nLarry Tesler was part of the group of three PARC employees who met Steve Jobs when Apple got to look around the facility in late 1979. That visit first exposed Jobs to the graphical user interface, which Apple later introduced to a mass audience with the Lisa and, more successfully, the Macintosh.\n\u201cYou could see the ideas running through Steve\u2019s brain really fast,\u201d Tesler told me when I interviewed him in 2011 for my book The Apple Revolution. \u201cHe could make connections at an incredibly high rate.\u201d\nJobs impressed Tesler. He was particularly dazzled by the Apple co-founder\u2019s mastery of seemingly every aspect of the computer industry. \u201cWe were technologists with very logical minds,\u201d Tesler told me. \u201cBut Steve also knew about marketing, distribution, finance \u2013 every aspect of the business you could think of.\u201d\nShortly after the Apple demonstration, Tesler quit his job at Xerox. He wound up joining Apple \u2014 even though it was still a relatively new startup at the time.\nHow Tesler joined Apple\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because Apple was really the trigger for me wanting to leave Xerox, but I\u2019d never seriously considered it as a career option,\u201d he told me. \u201cEven though I had been pretty impressed by the people who attended the PARC demo, I still thought of them as primarily being a hobbyist computer company. It wasn\u2019t like I was against going to work for them, but I also didn\u2019t come out of the demo thinking, \u2018I\u2019ve got to go and work for Apple.\u2019\u201d\nNonetheless, Tesler started at Apple on July 15, 1980. \u201cApple was just in a couple of buildings [at the time],\u201d he said. \u201cAt Xerox I would make an appointment with a VP, and that appointment would be three months or six months from now\u2026. Nothing could get decided. At Apple, I\u2019d walk a few doors down from my office and talk to Steve Jobs. If Steve wasn\u2019t in, I\u2019d talk to his secretary and have a meeting with him four hours later or else I\u2019d catch him in the hall. It was just a totally different situation in terms of the ability to reach people and to get decisions made.\u201d\nTesler worked first on the Apple Lisa project. This ill-fated computer was the first Apple machine to ship with a mouse and a graphical interface. Because Tesler previously worked with similar technology at PARC, he was a natural for the team.\nLarry Tesler and Steve Jobs\nWhile many Lisa engineers remember Jobs as a troublemaker, Tesler became amused by Jobs\u2019 enthusiasm. For the most part, at least. One day, Jobs woke Tesler up at 2 a.m. with a phone call about some minor detail of the project.\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember whether he even apologized for the late hour,\u201d Tesler said. \u201cI was kind of flattered that he would call me at that time. But I thought that it was a little off-base and I jokingly mentioned it to my boss the next day. It turned out that that wasn\u2019t the right thing for Steve to do at all. A lot of people had mentioned similar experiences and they were saving these up to build a case against him.\u201d\nIt ended with Jobs being booted from the Lisa team. Looking for another team to work with, he joined a bunch of renegades building a little computer called the Mac.\nAfter the Lisa, Tesler jumped around working on various Apple projects. Perhaps the most notable of these was the Newton MessagePad. Like the Lisa, the Newton was a comparative failure at the time, although it is an enormously significant computer in retrospect.\nAfter Larry Tesler left Apple\nTesler left Apple in 1997. For a while he worked at Amazon as VP of shopping experience. Later, he joined Yahoo! as VP of the user experience and design group. For the past decade, he worked as a freelance technology consultant.\nLarry Tesler died on February 17, 2020. He was a passionate advocate of better human-computer interaction. He was always very generous with his time when he spoke with me, and was a very gracious individual.\nIf you\u2019re interested in reading more about him, I\u2019d recommend John Markoff\u2019s excellent book, What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry. It details the early development of the personal computer. Tesler played a huge part in that revolution.",

        "body": "Popular infection simulation game Plague Inc. has been removed from Chinese app stores, Apple and Xiaomi users noticed today, after enjoying renewed popularity during the Covid-19 outbreak.\nWhy it matters: The removal shows just how serious the country\u2019s authorities are in managing the public perception of the virus.\nChinese authorities have been known to ban adult content and games with politically sensitive hidden messages. Plague Inc. has been praised for its educational value and scientific approach.\nDetails: TechNode has confirmed that Plague Inc. is not available on the Chinese versions of the Apple and Xiaomi app stores as of Thursday.\nThe game is still available on Steam, a video game download platform that is not blocked in China, though this loophole may be short-lived.\nThe internet regulator informed Ndemic Creations that the game was removed from app stores for \u201cillegal\u201d content, the developers said in a statement released on their website on Thursday evening.\nPlague Inc. is a strategy simulation game that invites users to create and evolve a pathogen to take over the human population, before humans come up with a cure. It was was developed by UK-based Ndemic Creations in 2011.\nThe developer was not immediately available for comment when contacted by TechNode on Thursday.\nContext: In January, the eight-year-old game beat Minecraft in Apple\u2019s US App Store\u2019s paid games popularity rankings, according to market intelligence firm Apptica. This happened on the day that Wuhan, the central Chinese city considered the epicenter of the outbreak, was cut off from the world.\nAt the time, Plague Inc.\u2019s UK-based developers responded to the news with a statement asking players to remain grounded in reality.\n\u201cPlease remember that Plague Inc. is a game, not a scientific model and that the current coronavirus outbreak is a very real situation which is impacting a huge number of people,\u201d Ndemic Creations said.\nThe game was recognized by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention back in 2013 for creating a \u201ccompelling world\u201d which \u201cengages the public on serious public health topics.\u201d\nIt has found enduring popularity since its creation and has been downloaded by 130 million people, according to the developer\u2019s website.\nThe coronavirus has sparked heated discussion on Chinese social media about the government\u2019s emergency response, as well as alleged acts of censorship.\nThe virus has spread to more than 78,000 and killed over 2,700 people in China as of Feb. 27, 2020, according to official data.\nUpdate: added a statement from the game developer in the Details section.",

        "title": "Bloomberg: Apple discussing allowing iPhone users to set third-party web browsers and email apps as defaults",
        "body": "Apple is said to be discussing adding the ability for users to set third-party apps as defaults, overriding the built-in preference for Apple\u2019s Safari and Mail. The news comes as Apple faces increasing scrutiny over how it operates the App Store whilst giving preferential treatment to its own apps and services.\nIn addition, Bloomberg says that Apple is considering opening up the HomePod to third-party music services like Spotify or Amazon Music. Right now, the HomePod can only natively interact with Apple Music.\nApple\u2019s rules currently allow developers to offer alternative web browsers in the App Store, but they all must be based off the system WebKit\u2019s rendering engine. It is also currently not possible for the user to tell iOS that it prefers the third-party browser over Safari; any tapped links will open in Safari every single time.\nSimilarly, there are many competing email apps in the App Store but shortcuts to composing a new email will only ever show the system Mail compose sheet. It sounds like Apple is now seriously weighing whether to open this up and allow other apps to appear instead of Safari and Mail.\nIt may also be possible to set a competing music app as the default, so that music playback requests to Siri would route to the third party audio app without having to explicitly say the name of the app in every request. Apple added support for third-party music and audio apps with SiriKit in iOS 13, but the current system will always prefer Apple Music and Apple Podcasts if the name of the third-party app is not specified.\nBloomberg says that Apple is working to add support for other music services to run natively on the HomePod. This means a HomePod owner would be able to request music from Spotify directly. As it stands today, playing music from any non-Apple source on the HomePod means AirPlaying audio from another device. In a 2019 complaint to the European Commission, lack of access to the HomePod was one of Spotify\u2019s top criticisms of Apple\u2019s business practices.\nAssuming Apple goes ahead with these features, expect to see them unveiled in June as part of the iOS 14 feature set. However, Bloomberg stresses that these efforts are still in development and \u201cfinal decisions haven\u2019t been made\u201d.",

        "body": "Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri took to the platform over the weekend to answer a few user questions on his story, shared by The Verge's Chris Welch. Among the many things asked, the topic of an official iPad app for Instagram was brought up, and Mosseri explained why we haven't seen one yet.\nAccording to Mosseri, the company \"would like to build an \u200ciPad\u200c app\" for Instagram, \"But we only have so many people, and lots to do, and it hasn't bubbled up as the next best thing to do yet.\"\nInstagram is technically viewable on \u200ciPad\u200c in a number of ways, but the company has never released a first-party \u200ciPad\u200c app that's been optimized for the tablet.\nInstagram users have been asking for an official \u200ciPad\u200c app nearly since the social network launched in 2010, the same year that the first \u200ciPad\u200c was released. Some alternatives include third-party Instagram apps for \u200ciPad\u200c, browsing Instagram on the web on \u200ciPad\u200c, or using the upscaled iPhone app on \u200ciPad\u200c.\nHe also said Instagram \u201cwould like to build an iPad app.\u201d \u201cBut we only have so many people, and lots to do, and it hasn\u2019t bubbled up as the next best thing to do yet.\u201d The iPad is 10 years old. Maybe by the time it\u2019s 20, then? \u2014 Chris Welch (@chriswelch) February 15, 2020\nIn another small tidbit shared during the Q&A, Mosseri explained that a very small group of Instagram users never see ads of any kind in the app, so that Instagram can \"understand the effect of that.\"\nFollowing the Cambridge Analytica controversy, Facebook and its family of companies have been pivoting and focusing on numerous security and privacy-related issues, as well as trying to make their platforms less hostile. As a recent example, Instagram began hiding \"likes\" from user posts last November, in an effort to \"depressurize\" the platform.\nAmid all of the scandals, Instagram's original co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger left Facebook in 2018, leading way for Mosseri's advancement from the Facebook news team to Instagram CEO.",

The country\u2019s health minister stated that 355 people onboard the ship have tested positive for the virus.\nThe smartphones were handed to each cabin so passengers could access an app made by the government, as per Macotakara via 9to5mac last Friday, Feb.14.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe said app from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare will allow people on the quarantined ship to consult with a doctor. Smartphones registered outside of Japan are unable to access the app. This also prompted the ministry to hand out the devices to the passengers.\nAccording to the report, the 2,000 devices were handed out to ensure that each cabin had one unit.\nThe ship arrived near the Japanese coast earlier this month with more than 3,700 people on board from over 50 countries. It was placed under quarantine after a passenger who left the vessel in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus.\nThe Japanese government may begin testing the travelers for the disease from Feb. 18, the captain said. Passengers with negative results will be allowed to disembark the ship starting Feb. 21.\nThe disease has already killed over 1,000 people and infected more than 42,000 worldwide.

        "body": "California law requires Apple to pay its workers for being searched before they leave retail stores, the state Supreme Court said.\nCalifornia law requires Apple Inc. to pay its workers for being searched before they leave retail stores, the California Supreme Court decided unanimously Thursday.\nA group of Apple workers filed a class-action lawsuit against the tech giant, charging they were required to submit to searches before leaving the stores but were not compensated for the time those searches required. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where the case is now pending, asked the California Supreme Court to clarify whether state law requires compensation.\nIn a decision written by Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, the court said an industrial wage order defines hours worked as \u201cthe time during which an employee is subject to the control of an employer, and includes all the time the employee is suffered or permitted to work, whether or not required to do so.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nApple, which has 52 retail stores in California, requires its workers to submit to exit searches of their bags, packages, purses, backpacks, brief cases and personal Apple devices, such as iPhones, to deter theft. Failure to comply with the search policy can lead to termination.\nEmployees are supposed to find a manager or security officer to do the searches after they clock out. Employees estimate that waiting for and undergoing the searches can take five to 20 minutes, or, on busiest days, up to 45 minutes.\nApple argued that workers could avoid such searches by choosing not to bring a bag, package, or personal Apple technology device to work.\nA federal district court judge ruled in favor of Apple, deciding that workers had to prove they not only were restrained from leaving but that there was no way to avoid having personal items searched.\nApple said it could prohibit employees from bringing any bags or personal Apple devices into its stores altogether but gave them that benefit. The California Supreme Court said a ban on any personal items would be \u201cdraconian.\u201d\n\u201cUnder the circumstances of this case and the realities of ordinary, 21st century life, we find farfetched and untenable Apple\u2019s claim that its bag-search policy can be justified as providing a benefit to its employees,\u201d the court said.\nAdvertisement\nThe court noted that workers may need a bag to hold ordinary, everyday items, including wallets, keys, cellphones, eye glasses and water bottles.\n\u201cApple\u2019s proposed rule conditioning compensability on whether an employee can theoretically avoid bringing a bag, purse, or iPhone to work does not offer a workable standard, and certainly not an employee protective one,\u201d Cantil-Sakauye wrote.\nThe court\u2019s decision is retroactive. The case will now return to the 9th Circuit, where the federal judges will apply Thursday\u2019s interpretation of state law.",

        "body": "Several reports have suggested that Apple is planning to release new over-ear headphones during the first half of this year, likely to complement the rest of its AirPods lineup. Now, YouTuber Jon Prosser has shared an image on Twitter claiming to show new Apple headphones in Target\u2019s inventory system.\nUpdate: Target inventory also references new Apple TV, iPod touch, and Apple Watch bands\nIn the image, which you can see below, Target\u2019s inventory system shows something referred to as \u201cApple AirPods (X Generation)\u201d with a $399.99 price tag. Apple\u2019s currently AirPods lineup maxes out with the AirPods Pro at $249, so this is clearly a new higher-end option.\nProsser adds that there are three different SKUs listed for this product, suggesting that Apple\u2019s headphones could be available in multiple different colors.\nAppleInsider adds that it spoke to several Target staffers this morning, who said \u201cplaceholders for new products are common\u201d and that pricing information is usually accurate, while product names are not. This means Apple\u2019s over-ear headphones are (unsurprisingly) unlikely to be called \u201cAirPods X Generation.\u201d\nA $399 price point is certainly at the high-end of the market, but it makes sense considering Apple\u2019s $249 price tag for AirPods Pro.\nApple over-ear headphones\nMost recently, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said to expect Apple\u2019s new premium headphones sometime during the first half of this year. These are expected to be separate from Apple\u2019s existing lineup of Beats headphones, though it\u2019s unknown how exactly they\u2019ll be different from products like the Beats Solo Pro.\nThere\u2019s quite a bit of evidence to suggest that Apple is planning a March event for this year to announce new iPad Pro models and the oft-rumored iPhone 9. New over-ear headphones certainly seem like the perfect addition to that event, but it\u2019s important to remember that Apple hasn\u2019t formally announced a keynote just yet.\nWhat do you think of rumors suggesting Apple is developing over-ear headphones to complement its AirPods line of audio products? Let us know down in the comments!\nMultiple Target employees have started reaching out to me about this \ud83e\udd14 Showing up in their systems and on UPC scanners is this mysterious \u201cApple AirPods (X Generation)\u201d listing, priced at $399. \ud83d\udc40 Potentially Apple\u2019s over-ear \u201cStudioPods\u201d headphones.

        "body": "With the latest beta releases, Apple has added the ability for developers to create unified purchases across Mac and iOS.\nThis means that a developer can list an iPad app in the App Store and a Mac version in the Mac App Store. When the customer buys either version, it automatically unlocks for all platforms. Previously, developers could only offer separate independent purchases.\nThis feature is clearly designed with Mac Catalyst in mind but the unified purchase capability can be applied to any Mac app.\nThe developer simply has to change their Mac to use the same bundle identifier as the iOS app, and the App Store handles unifying the purchases. For developers with existing independent Mac apps, migrating to a universal purchase model might e difficult.\nApple is automatically enabling unified purchases for new Mac Catalyst applications created with the just-released Xcode 11.4 beta. Existing apps will have to change their bundle identifiers if the want to switch to unified purchases.\nIt\u2019s not just paid up-front apps that can benefit. In-app purchases can also be shared across iOS and Mac fior the first time, if the core app is unified.\nTo support these changing, Apple is calibrating the App Store categories on both iOS and Mac to be the same. This means iOS apps can now be placed into new \u2018Developer Tools\u2019 and \u2018Graphics & Design\u2019 categories. The Mac App Store is adding categories for \u201cBooks\u201d, \u201cFood & Drink\u201d, \u201cMagazines & Newspapers\u201d, \u201cNavigation\u201d and \u201cShopping\u201d.\nIn related news, with watchOS 6.2, Apple is adding StoreKit to native Watch apps so developers will be able to sell in-app purchases directly on the Apple Watch.",

        "body": "What you need to know\nYoutuber/tech extraordinaire Jonathan Morrison has finally found a way to push the Mac Pro to the limit.\nHis weapon of choice? Google Chrome.\nHe opened up more than 6000 tabs, swallowing 1.5TB of RAM in the process.\nJonathan Morrison has finally done the unthinkable, maxing out the memory of a Mac Pro by opening 6000 tabs in Google Chrome.\nMorrison has brought us plenty of joy these last couple of months, as he's put the Mac Pro through its paces. Not only has he managed to run 16K video playback using just one of its graphics cards, he also gave it a spin with two world-renowned music producers, who couldn't even make it break a sweat..\nNow, however, the Mac Pro finally seems to have met its match in Google Chrome, which... we all should have seen coming really.\nIn a hilarious Twitter thread yesterday, January 7, Morrison posted to show that Google Chrome was using up an obnoxious 75GB of RAM, which is more than most computers. Obviously, a lightbulb went off in his head, and he decided to keep opening tabs to see what would happen.\nHe posted to show he'd reached a landmark 2000 tabs, then again when he hit 3000. Up until that point, things were going well with Chrome only using a meager 126GB of RAM. Passing through 4000 and 5000 tabs, things seemed to be going well, as memory usage held steady at around 170GB. Then all of a sudden he hit 6000, and Chrome's memory usage skyrocketed to 857GB! At this point, Morrison said, \"guys it's climbing rapidly computer might explode lol.\"\nHis final tweet before everything went black just said \"code red\", and highlighted memory usage of 1,401.42GB, insane. Thankfully, Morrison has tweeted since, so it looks like he survived whatever explosion/fire is bound to have taken place shortly after. No word on his Mac Pro though. RIP.",

        "body": "Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, and had he not passed away in 2011 at the age of 56, today would have marked his 65th birthday. Jobs founded Apple alongside Steve Wozniak in 1976, and he was at the forefront of the personal computer revolution with machines like the Apple 1, Apple II, and the original Macintosh with its now-iconic name.\nJobs was ousted from Apple in 1985 after disagreements with then-CEO John Sculley, and after his departure, Apple struggled and was on the brink of failure. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 after his company, NeXT, was acquired, and he proceeded to lead the company to the wild success that it enjoys today.\nMany of Apple's most important products were developed under Jobs' leadership, including the iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, the App Store, the MacBook, the iMac, and more. and his design philosophies and drive for perfection continue to shape Apple even nine years after his death.\nApple CEO Tim Cook has often said that Jobs' DNA - his taste, his thinking, his dedication to hard work, and his lust for innovation - will \"always be the foundation of Apple.\"\nThere is not a single Apple product on the market that has not been influenced by Steve Jobs, and that even extends to many non-Apple products. Smartphones today look the way they do because Steve Jobs led the development of the all-screen no-keyboard \u200ciPhone\u200c in 2007.\nMillions of lives have been improved by Apple devices, and Apple's iPhones, iPads, and Macs are some of the most popular products on the planet. Apple has more than 1.5 billion active devices around the world, which is astounding, and there are always new and exciting projects on the horizon.\nNew iPhones are released on a yearly basis, iPads are now as powerful as computers, Macs get better with each iteration, and Apple is working on intriguing future technology like AR/VR headsets and even a car.\nAs always, Apple fans around the world will celebrate Steve Jobs and all of his accomplishments today, and we can also expect to hear from Apple executives like \u200cTim Cook\u200c, who often honors Jobs on his birthday.",

        "title": "Apple Pay is on pace to account for 10% of all global card transactions",
        "body": "Apple\u2019s mobile wallet is gobbling up a growing chunk of card payments around the world. As the service grows, it\u2019s becoming a greater challenge to rivals like PayPal and attracting the attention of competition watchdogs.\nApple Pay accounts for about 5% of global card transactions and is on pace to handle 1-in-10 such payments by 2025, according to recent trend data compiled by Bernstein, a research firm. \u201cThere are indeed plenty of reasons to worry that Apple may attempt to disrupt the payments ecosystem,\u201d Bernstein analysts, led by Harshita Rawat, wrote in a research note.\nAdvertisement\nAs iPhone sales plateau, the Cupertino-based company is leaning into its services division, which includes Apple Pay. The unit generated $12.7 billion in revenue in the last three months of 2019, a 17% increase from a year earlier. The company\u2019s payments ambitions have the benefit of a massive cash hoard, years of experience in card transactions, and a vast customer base consisting of hundreds of millions of iPhone users.\nThe digital payments race is an immense opportunity, representing about $1 trillion in revenue around world. Visa and MasterCard process more than $14 trillion of payments each year and are still growing as more transactions go online, flow through apps, and as consumers in many parts of the world use cash less often.\nApple Pay makes money by taking a sliver of each transaction that runs through the device. Users can store their credit and debit cards on the wallet and use it to make contactless payments\u2014beefed up with biometric security\u2014through their phone\u2019s near-field communication (NFC) tech. In the US, contactless payments are forecast to increase to $1.5 trillion in 2024, up from $178 billion this year, according to Juniper Research.\nAdvertisement\nThere\u2019s no shortage of slick, feature-rich payment apps out there, but Apple Pay has several advantages. The app is pre-installed on iPhones, and Apple has tight control over the device\u2019s NFC technology that\u2019s used for contactless payments. That\u2019s why Apple Pay is the only iPhone mobile wallet that can make NFC transactions. (Alipay and WeChat Pay, the enormously popular Chinese payment apps, use QR-codes. The optical codes are read through a phone\u2019s camera and aren\u2019t controlled by Apple.)\nAcademics, lawyers, and executives see Apple\u2019s control over the iPhone NFC chip as a way to block competition and make its own wallet more popular. Apple argues that its policies are for security against hackers and to make the user experience as smooth as possible.\nTech and card giants\nApple CEO Tim Cook is aiming to give the wallet an extra boost by linking it to cash backs through the company\u2019s credit card. Apple Pay revenue and transactions more than doubled in its last fiscal quarter, Cook said recently in a conference call with analysts, and the wallet is becoming more widely available for train and bus commuting around the world, with rollouts in Chinese cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou coming this spring.\nApple Pay probably won\u2019t pose a challenge to the card giants anytime soon. While the tech company could, in theory, create its own network that runs outside the card systems, Bernstein argues that Apple still needs the card networks, which are ubiquitous and trusted. Visa and MasterCard, meanwhile, are used to dealing with partners (traditionally large card-issuing banks) with the kind of scale that even Apple Pay could muster.\nAdvertisement\nThe same may not be true for other wallets. \u201cApple Pay is indeed one of the long-term competitive threats to PayPal,\u201d Bernstein analysts wrote. For now, PayPal has a commanding lead in the world of online checkouts, and also benefits from network effects that have been building up since the turn of the century. But Apple and PayPal could end up competing for the same turf in the coming years.\nIn the meantime, European officials are eyeing Apple Pay more closely. German lawmakers recently passed a measure that would require tech companies to open up their interfaces for payment services, but domestic lenders, including Deutsche Bank, have reportedly decided not to take advantage of Apple\u2019s NFC interface.\nAnd the European Commission is probing Apple\u2019s control over the iPhone\u2019s NFC tech, marking the second time EU officials have scrutinized the mobile wallet\u2019s impact on the market. The commission\u2019s earlier, preliminary view was that there was sufficient competition, but that could change as Apple Pay uptake increases.",

        "title": "Apple drops a bomb on long-life HTTPS certificates: Safari to snub new security certs valid for more than 13 months",
        "body": "Safari will, later this year, no longer accept new HTTPS certificates that expire more than 13 months from their creation date.\nThat means websites using long-life SSL/TLS certs issued after the cut-off point will throw up privacy errors in Apple's browser.\nThe policy was unveiled by the iGiant at a Certification Authority Browser Forum (CA/Browser) meeting on Wednesday. Specifically, according to those present at the confab, from September 1, any new website cert valid for more than 398 days will not be trusted by the Safari browser and instead rejected. Older certs, issued prior to the deadline, are unaffected by this rule.\nBy implementing the policy in Safari, Apple will, by extension, enforce it on all iOS and macOS devices. This will put pressure on website admins and developers to make sure their certs meet Apple's requirements \u2013 or risk breaking pages on a billion-plus devices and computers.\nCertificates issued on or after that date with term beyond 398 days will be distrusted in Apple products\nTim Callan, a senior fellow at PKI and SSL management firm Sectigo, who attended this week's meeting in Slovakia, told The Register: \"This week Apple announced at the 49th CA/Browser Forum Face-to-Face that it will limit the term of accepted TLS certificates to 398 days as of September 1, 2020. Certificates issued on or after that date with term beyond 398 days will be distrusted in Apple products.\n\"Certificates issued prior to September 1 will have the same acceptable duration as certificates do today, which is 825 days. No action is required for these certificates.\"\nCutting certificate lifetimes has been mulled by Apple, Google, and other members of CA/Browser for months. The policy has its benefits and drawbacks.\nThe aim of the move is to improve website security by making sure devs use certs with the latest cryptographic standards, and to reduce the number of old, neglected certificates that could potentially be stolen and re-used for phishing and drive-by malware attacks. If boffins or miscreants are able to break the cryptography in a SSL/TLS standard, short-lived certificates will ensure people migrate to more secure certs within roughly a year.\nShortening the lifespan of certificates does come with some drawbacks. It has been noted that by increasing the frequency of certificate replacements, Apple and others are also making life a little more complicated for site owners and businesses that have to manage the certificates and compliance.\n\"Companies need to look to automation to assist with certificate deployment, renewal, and lifecycle management to reduce human overhead and the risk of error as the frequency of certificate replacement increase,\" Callan told us.\nWe note Let's Encrypt issues free HTTPS certificates that expire after 90 days, and provides tools to automate renewals, so those will be just fine \u2013 and they are used all over the web now. El Reg's cert is a year-long affair so we'll be OK.\nThese truly are the end times for TLS 1.0, 1.1: Firefox hopes to 'eradicate' weak HTTPS standard by blocking it READ MORE\nGitHub.com uses a two-year certificate, which would fall foul of Apple's rules though it was issued before the cut-off deadline. However, it is due to be renewed by June, so there's plenty of opportunity to sort that out. Apple's website has a year-long HTTPS cert that needs renewing in October.\nMicrosoft is an interesting one: its dot-com's cert is a two-year affair, which expires in October. If Redmond renews it for another two years, it'll trip up over Safari's policy.\nNo public announcement has been made by Apple, it seems. Digicert's Dean Coclin has issued a memo about the policy:\n\"Why did Apple unilaterally decide to enforce a shorter certificate lifetime?\" Coclin pondered.\n\"Their spokesperson said it was to 'protect users.' We know from prior CA/B Forum discussions that longer certificate lifetimes proved to be challenging in replacing certificates, in the case of a major security incident. Apple clearly wants to avoid an ecosystem that cannot quickly respond to major certificate-related threats.\n\"Short-lived certificates improve security because they reduce the window of exposure if a TLS certificate is compromised. They also help remediate normal operational churn within organizations by ensuring yearly updates to identity such as company names, addresses and active domains. As with any improvement, shortening of lifetimes should be balanced against the hardship required of certificate users to implement these changes.\"\nApple declined to comment. \u00ae",

        "title": "Google has paid Android developers about half of what Apple has",
        "body": "As I write this the evening before you\u2019re reading it, the colossal caucus clusterf*** in Iowa is still ongoing and no official results are anywhere in sight. It seems clear that some portion of the problem stems from a poorly architected app. It\u2019s an incredibly bad start to the 2020 election \u2014 not because we should expect the results to be in doubt, but because you\u2019d like to think regardless of politics we\u2019d at least improve our competence at running elections.\nNot so much. There\u2019s obviously more to come, so for now let\u2019s look at the second biggest tech news yesterday. Google released its quarterly earnings and did something it never has before: actually provided financial details for YouTube and even provided some color on its hardware business. The consensus is it did so because overall the company didn\u2019t meet expectations for revenue, so it wanted to give everybody something else to pay attention to. We won\u2019t be fooled by Google\u2019s blatant misdirection, which is...\nJust kidding. Of course we\u2019re going to pay attention to the shiny new numbers. Though to be fair, you should know my attitude towards most financial results is to tell you that unless you\u2019re a significant investor, you should only care insofar as the results say something about the products and services the company is selling.\nWe\u2019ll have analysis of YouTube\u2019s numbers up on the site today, so instead I\u2019ll just pay a little more attention to the Android bit: a total of $80 billion paid out to Android developers, which is significantly less than the $155 billion Apple has paid out via the iOS App Store.\nYou are reading Processor, a newsletter about computers, software, and tech by Dieter Bohn. Dieter writes about consumer tech, software, and the most important tech news of the day from The Verge.

Subscribe\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge that highlights top stories of the day, as well as occasional messages from sponsors and / or partners of The Verge.\nEven if you account for Google allowing developers to use their own payment methods and made a bunch of other caveats, I suspect you can\u2019t avoid the truth. The vast majority of phones on Earth run Android, and yet it is almost surely the case that there\u2019s more money for developers in iPhone apps. That\u2019s always been the conventional wisdom, but Google\u2019s own numbers all but confirm it.\nGoogle also detailed how much money it made on \u201cother bets:\u201d $17 billion. Some portion of that includes Google\u2019s hardware business, which Pichai characterized as a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar\u201d business. I strongly suspect that hardware\u2019s piece of that pie is in the low single digits, otherwise Google might be more eager to crow about it. I also suspect Pichai and Google\u2019s hardware boss Rick Osterloh are sick of people asking them if hardware is just a hobby.\nWell, until Google comes clean and gives more information about its hardware business, I think it\u2019s fair to keep asking how serious the company really is about it. And to bring it back to my frame for financial results: the answer to that question is also the answer to why Pixel phones aren\u2019t doing as well as they could.\nGoogle earnings\nNick Statt:\nOn an annual basis, Google says YouTube generated $15 billion last year and contributed roughly 10 percent to all Google revenue. Those figures make YouTube\u2019s ad business nearly one fifth the size of Facebook\u2019s, and more than six times larger than all of Amazon-owned Twitch. ... Google massively beat Wall Street expectations on profit, but missed on revenue. That could be one reason why Google may be disclosing YouTube and Google Cloud revenues for the first time.\nGoogle\u2019s Sundar Pichai also revealed today how big a check the company has written to Android app developers over the years \u2014 $80 billion to date, presumably dating back to the launch of the Android Market (now Google Play) in 2008. Roughly a year ago, Apple mentioned that it had shared $120 billion with App Store developers, by comparison.\nCaucus news\nVerge Deal of the day Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro are $30 off at Amazon Normally $250, the Apple AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are down to $220 at Amazon. Compared to the standard AirPods, these feature better sound quality and noise cancellation. We\u2019ve seen these drop a bit lower in price before, but that\u2019s a pretty rare occurrence.

And while the Iowa Caucus has brought massive political attention to the small state, little of that attention has gone to the state\u2019s networks.\nNow, after what Pai says was an \u201cextensive investigation,\u201d the question turns to just how severely the FCC will penalize the mobile providers involved. Will it be something substantial or merely a wrist slap that leaves no lasting reminder for the companies that gave away some of the most sensitive data your phone can produce?\nGadget news\nGreat review from Monica Chin. The tradeoffs you have to make in order to have a super light 14-inch laptop wouldn\u2019t be worth it to me, but maybe they would be for you.\nThere\u2019s not a ton to complain about here, but the Swift 5 isn\u2019t top of its class in these categories. Where it stands out is portability \u2014 and compared to previous Swift models, it asks remarkably few sacrifices in exchange.\nA bunch of videos came out today showing the Motorola Razr creaking as it opens and closed \u2014 not to mention sub-par camera quality. As always, I\u2019ll wait to make a final opinion in the review. I hope that Samsung sets a very high bar for quality for itself with this phone \u2014 if everybody is going to act like these are normal phones for people to buy, they should be as reliable as normal phones.\nRemember how I have said that it would be awful nice if expensive gadgetry that\u2019s meant to last more than five or ten years could have the computer part be modular? And how even though that seems like an obvious idea, it never seems to pan out? Add another example to the pile:\nThe software giant was planning to allow Surface Hub 2S owners to upgrade to this cartridge, improving the processor and GPU inside. It was also part of how Microsoft would enable tiling and rotation support on the Surface Hub 2, a big feature the company originally unveiled last year.\nAn incomplete, pre-iPhone-smartphone-brand scorecard of the smartphone brands that have been picked up by or sold off to other companies:\nNokia : zombiebrand run by HMD that actually makes pretty good, well-liked phones! 8/10\n: zombiebrand run by HMD that actually makes pretty good, well-liked phones! 8/10 Palm : zombiebrand acquired by TCL and handed off to a little Verizon-funded startup to make a time-well-spent phone that is pretty bad. 4/10\n: zombiebrand acquired by TCL and handed off to a little Verizon-funded startup to make a time-well-spent phone that is pretty bad. 4/10 BlackBerry: zombiebrand licensed by TCL to make the last physical keyboard phones that started okay then got way worse. Also an actual enterprise services company that does alright. 5/10\nMore from The Verge\nThis happens All The Damn Time and every time it happens to a major company we all chuckle and wonder how they could forget until the next big company forgets. Anyway, next time you walk out the front door without your phone or whatever, give yourself a break, because everybody forgets important things sometimes.",

        "title": "2020 MacBook Pro 13\" Benchmark Leak Shows 30% GPU, 12% CPU Gain",
        "body": "Cupertino tech giant Apple Inc had a busy calendar year 2019 as it looked to upgrade all product areas in order to compensate for a revenue drop from the iPhone lineup. We saw upgrades made to the iPod, iPhone, iPad and MacBook lineups. The MacBook, in particular, not only got a processor refresh in the form of eight-generation Intel processors launched a year back in Q2 2019, but Apple also introduced a new form factor to the lineup in the form of a brand new 16-inch MacBook Pro.\nThe latest MacBook refresh marked a small jump from the lineup's design language in the form of changes to the TouchBar control strip. Now, some folks speculate that this year Apple might also introduce similar changes on the more mainstream 13\" MacBook Pros - which, mind you, are also speculatively headed to second-generation 10nm processors from Intel.\nToday we've got a benchmark leak pegging the rumored 13-inch notebook with a variant of Intel's 10th-generation 10nm Ice Lake Core i7-1068G7 processor and comparing the device's TimeSpy score with those belonging to a 13-inch 2019 MacBook Pro with an eight-generation Intel Core i5-8279U.\nBenchmark Shows 13-inch 2020 MacBook Pro Powered By An Intel Core i7-1068'N'G7 Processor Gain Aggregate 21% Lead Over Its Core i5 Powered Predecessor\nThe benchmark is the courtesy of Twitter user who has been very active in keeping in line with details for upcoming MacBook refreshes and upgrades. _rogame (a reliable source who accurately predicted the presence of Radeon 5500M on the 16\" MacBook Pro. This fact was previously mentioned in an anonymous tip to MacRumors.) shares 3D Mark Time Spy benchmarks belonging to a rumored highest-end variant of Apple's 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro lineup. This variant, as per the details shared by the Tweeter through an earlier leak, will be powered by a tenth-generation Intel chip, 32GB of RAM and a 2TB solid-state drive.\nThe benchmark scores of this alleged 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro show that it is capable of gaining a 21% aggregate lead in scores over the top base-variant (non-customized) of its predecessor, the 13-inch 2019 MacBook Pro powered by an 8th Generation Intel Core i5 chip. You can see the scores below.\nAn alleged benchmark run of the 13\" 2020 MacBook Pro with a variant of Intel's Core i7-1068G7 CPU shows a strong lead over the 2019 13\" MacBook Pro powered by an eight-generation Core i5 processor; Courtesy; _rogame\n13-inch MacBook Pro 2020 should feature custom-packaged 10th generation Ice Lake Core i7 Processor\nToday's leak is an important one as it hints at a 10nm processor upgrade finally making it to the smaller MacBook Pro form factor. It also makes us speculate on a possible chassis-refresh for the notebooks that might be headed our way later this year. While no concrete evidence related to such a shift has surfaced so far, it makes sense for Apple to make such a change as 2020 marks four years since the lineup's last such overhaul.\nBut, while the presence of a 10nm chip is welcoming, there isn't any evidence so far of AMD making its way onto the high-end macOS notebooks' smaller factor. While Radeon has made it on Apple's 15-inch and 16-inch MacBooks, the 13-inch form factor still does not have dedicated GPUs from AMD, as thermal constraints might still be a concern for Apple in the arena.\nThe tenth-generation Core i7-1068G7 CPU is the best performing mobility chip of the Ice Lake family of processors' U-Series. It features four cores, eight threads and 64 execution units courtesy of Iris Plus. The thermal design point of the chip is 28W, and it has a base frequency of 2.3GHz. The 1068G7 is also capable of achieving a single-core turbo clock frequency 4.1GHz, with all core turbo clock frequency standing at 3.1GHz.\nThe Core i7-1068NG7 chip mentioned in today's benchmark is likely to feature a different package than the i5-1068G7 CPU mentioned throughout this piece. Earlier benchmarks of an alleged 2020 MacBook Air refresh have also hinted at different packages for the ultrabook's CPU.",

        "title": "Panicked selling of AAPL lets Apple buy back billions cheaply",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nCoronavirus fears have launched new panic, opportunity\nMedia-induced panic related to the coronavirus outbreak has caused stocks to crash in value, with Apple's share price dropping to levels not seen since early December, back before it was appreciated how well Apple's iPhone 11, wearables, services, and other offerings had performed during holiday sales. That drop affords Apple a rare opportunity to snatch up billions of its shares at a discount nobody could have otherwise imagined possible.\nThis all happened before\nApple's quick action to buy back billions of its shares at a discount after irrational stock dips have repeatedly occurred over the past decade. In both 2013 and 2014 the company scrambled to buy double-digit billions worth of Apple stock after tech media sources repeatedly depicted its record sales as \"disappointing.\"\nThat history continued into the most recent holiday quarter, when Apple's chief financial officer Luca Maestri detailed efforts to buy up tens of millions of shares at an average price of $250 before those shares began climbing north of $325 this month.\nNow that Apple's share price has dived back down toward those earlier levels, Apple has the unexpected opportunity to continue buying shares near that price\u2014 after having established that in normal conditions, Apple shares are worth more than $325. And Apple has made it clear that it expects to return to normal operating conditions soon as factories return to production, and as COVID-19 infections are brought under control, two things the company has already outlined to be happening.\n\"Apple is trying to keep investors informed on a very fluid situation that is unprecedented,\" noted Daniel Ives, Managing Director of Equity Research at Wedbush Securities, in a comment to AppleInsider. Ives added that \"buybacks could potentially accelerate given this massive sell-off as Apple remains a major buyer of its own stock.\"\nThe recent 20% drop of more than $60 per share represents a market cap dive of more than $262 billion. That would rationally suggest that investors suddenly fear a massive, extended earnings shortfall far in excess of what they braced for just a week ago, on \"news\" of little more than the uncertainty of what would be happening.\nApple initially reported the expectation that its March quarter \u2014 historically the least busy quarter of the year\u2014 would deliver between $63 billion to $67 billion in revenues, depending on the scale of interruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak.\nOn February 18, Apple revised its guidance without supplying a specific figure, noting only that in light of new findings, it did not expect to reach the $63 billion low-end of its range that it had earlier provided. That means Apple expected that its March quarter revenues would be at least $4 billion worse than the most optimistic high-end of its initial guidance provided just weeks earlier. That's significant, but not representative of a massive, long-term drop in earnings going forward.\nMedia sources have latched onto the coronavirus outbreak with breathless reporting of deaths, closed factories, supply chain production issues, widespread closures of universities, and other shutdowns. Apple itself hasn't sounded panic over the issues despite having a serious, fiduciary responsibility to honestly report the company's true status as a publicly-traded company.\nCook can't lie about Apple's predicament, and he doesn't need to\nApple's chief executive Tim Cook just expressed his confidence on Thursday that \"China is getting the Coronavirus under control,\" adding, \"we have reopened factories, so the factories are working through the conditions to open, they're reopening. They're also in ramp. So I sort of I think of this as the third phase in getting back to normal, and we're in phase three of the ramp mode.\"\nGetting production back on schedule is certainly a complex and difficult task for the company, but Apple operates the world's most expertly proficient operational organization in existence, producing incredible volumes of premium mobile devices at profits that tower far above its rivals. Apple's ability to deal with supply chain crisis events has been tested many times before, and the company is always optimizing its production runs and balancing its supply chain needs across a tangled web of suppliers with incredible competency.\nApple is so good at its global operations that it has been exercising the luxury of going out of its way to, for example, develop new forms of recycled aluminum just to shutter the virgin aluminum smelting plants that were contributing to its global carbon footprint. The company has also spent years focusing on the rights of the workers its suppliers hire, giving it deep insight into the human element of its business that most of its rivals simply delegate away to contract manufacturers.\nNone of these things are commercially necessary work to build the products Apple makes. The company's rivals aren't even trying to match its efforts. Yet Apple is uniquely profitable in a sea of supposed competitors that are barely turning a profit on their sales of phones, PCs, tablets, and wearables. Apple's ability to attract and retain long-term buyers who then buy other new products and subscribe to the company's services is exactly what drove the price of the company up over the last several months.\nApple's stock price has not been driven upward by euphoria about short term revenue peaks. In fact, over the last decade, Apple frequently reported massive spikes in revenues only to see its share price remain unchanged or even fall on fears that its current success couldn't possibly be expected to continue.\nApple's revenues under temporary threat from coronavirus interruptions similarly shouldn't drive Apple's share price. What has changed is the clearer understanding that Apple's revenues and profitability are not a short-term aberration, but rather the result of building a well-oiled cash machine that has no equal\u2014 and effectively no real competition.\nThe Media is free to lie\nMedia sources and analysts have no legal responsibility to tell the truth, and many have frequently flat-out lied about Apple's situation over the past several years. The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Reuters, and Japan's Nikkei have all stridently screamed that generation after generation of new flagship iPhones were imperiled by \"disappointing\" demand, claimed that \"channel checks\" had given them clear insight into Apple's troubled production that certainly meant that sales were about to slip away to Android and never return, and rigorously promoted the false idea that buyers simply weren't going to pay $1,000 or more for a phone. They were consistently, unrepentantly wrong in their reporting.\nThe media is so bad at reporting on Apple that it is a story itself\nMedia research groups have similarly long insisted that Apple Watch and HomePod were incredible failures, despite both growing into multi-billion dollar businesses selling profitable and sticky products that promote continued sales of other hardware and services, including Apple Music. None of them had to answer for their giddy promotion of Alexa, \"voice first,\" smart bands, or any other rival product that ultimately failed to deliver upon the promise of creating an important, financially significant app development platform or related sales of products, online orders, or other services.\nUntil just recently, investors had been fed the idea \u2014 for years \u2014 that Apple was experiencing slack demand for its products, particularly in China, and was watching helplessly as it continued to bleed away unit sales volumes while companies such as Huawei kept posting new unit sales increases. But that was not accurate.\nOnce the market came to realize that Apple's continued success was clearly untethered to the unit sales of Huawei, and that demand for its products could be addressed simply with more aggressive promotions by Apple itself, investors responded by revaluing the company at a significantly higher multiple, driving its share price into record territory.",

        "body": "TAIPEI (Taiwan News) \u2014 As the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread in China, Apple is moving the manufacture of some of its top devices to Taiwan.\nApple has begun to move the production of a number of its top gadgets set to launch in the first half of 2020, according to a report by am730, which cited DigiTimes. The products listed in the report to be shifted to Taiwan include AirPods Pro Lite, iPads, and Apple Watches.\nApple is trying to diversify its supply chain geographically due to the spread of the virus, which has seriously affected the production of Apple products in the communist country. Apple intends to gradually increase the proportion of production in Taiwan while still trying to maintain its cooperation with suppliers on the other side of the strait.\nIt is estimated that at least one-third of China's production lines will lay idle in the first quarter of this year, and it would be almost impossible to return to the normal level of production before the end of February. It is also doubtful whether normal production could be resumed within the first ten days of March.\nHowever, the report did not mention additional details about Airpods Pro Lite. Apple launched the Airpods Pro, which have an active noise cancelation function, in October last year.\nIn March of 2019, Apple introduced a slightly improved second generation of AirPods. It is speculated that Apple will be releasing its third-generation AirPods early this year.",

        "title": "iPhone 9 pricing: Another report corroborates $399 starting price",
        "body": "We could be just around a month away from the official announcement of Apple\u2019s long-rumored iPhone 9. Ahead of that unveil, rumors continue to circle around the device\u2019s pricing and how it will fit into Apple\u2019s lineup. This week, a new report from Fast Company corroborates that the iPhone 9 price will start at $399.\niPhone 9 price:\nReliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had previously predicted that the iPhone 9 will start at $399, following the precedent set by the iPhone SE in 2016. Fast Company\u2019s report this week doubles down on that starting price, citing its own sources near the iPhone supply chain.\nThe iPhone SE was positioned at the low-end of Apple\u2019s iPhone lineup, starting at $399 with 16GB of storage. It was unique at the time for offering specifications of the then-modern iPhone lineup, but in a smaller form factor. Apple now appears to be mimicking that strategy this year with the rumored iPhone 9.\nThe iPhone 9 is expected to feature a 4.7-inch display, which is bigger than the iPhone SE, but smaller than the flagship iPhone 11 lineup. It\u2019s also expected to be powered by Apple\u2019s latest A13 processor, which guarantees iOS updates for many years down the line. In terms of design, we expect an iPhone 8-style body with Touch ID.\nFor that $399 iPhone 9 starting price, Kuo has predicted that you\u2019ll get 64GB of storage. For comparison\u2019s sake, Apple still sells the 64GB iPhone 8 for $449. Essentially, the iPhone 9 will get improved performance and the same amount of storage, but for $50 cheaper. This week\u2019s report from Fast Company doesn\u2019t detail storage capacities.\nWhat\u2019s Apple\u2019s logic behind the iPhone 9? With its new focus on Services, such as Apple Arcade and Apple TV+, Apple has a major incentive to keep as many iPhone users on the latest version of iOS as possible. An iPhone 9 priced at $399 could be a major incentive for those still using devices like iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus to upgrade to a device capable of running iOS 13.\nWhat do you think of the iPhone 9 rumors so far? Do you buy into Apple\u2019s strategy? Let us know down in the comments. Keep up with everything we know about the iPhone 9 in our full roundup of features, pricing, and more right here.\nRead more:",

The service, which was first spotted by MacRumors, can be accessed through Apple\u2019s support site, where under certain circumstances you\u2019ll now see an onsite repair option in addition to the existing instore and mail-in services. \u201cIn select locations, onsite service may be available,\u201d Apple\u2019s support page reads.\nThe repairs are being offered via Go Tech Services, whose website lists it as an Apple Authorized Service Provider.

        "title": "Today in Apple history: Steve Jobs says Apple is finally debt-free - CultOfMac",
        "body": "February 18, 2004: Steve Jobs sends an internal memo to Apple employees revealing that the company is, for the first time in years, totally debt-free.\n\u201cToday is a historic day of sorts for our company,\u201d he writes. This marks a big turnaround from the bad old days of the 1990s, when Apple carried more than $1 billion in debt \u2014 and faced the danger of bankruptcy.\nApple becomes debt-free\nAchieving debt-free status was, in some ways, a formality for Apple. By this time, the company had enough money in the bank to easily clear its remaining debt. By 2004, Apple had released the iMac, iBook and iPod, and had launched the iTunes Store. Cupertino clearly changed course and headed in the right direction.\nNonetheless, using $300 million in cash to pay off the last of its debt proved a symbolic triumph. Apple CFO Fred Anderson, on the verge of retirement, confirmed the news.\nThe end of debt \u2026 for now\nApple revealed its plans to pay off the debt, originally borrowed in 1994, in an SEC filing dated February 10, 2004:\n\u201cThe Company currently has debt outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes that were originally issued in 1994. The notes, which pay interest semiannually, were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes, along with approximately $1.5 million of unamortized deferred gains on closed interest rate swaps, are due in February of 2004 and therefore have been classified as current debt as of December 27, 2003. The Company currently anticipates utilizing its existing cash balances to settle these notes when due.\u201d\nJobs\u2019 email to Apple employees also mentioned that the company had $4.8 billion in the bank in February 2004. These days, Apple maintains a much larger pile of cash reserves (although its finances are structured in such a way that the company also carries a large amount of debt).\nApple profitable once again\nBy 2004, Apple had been profitable for about six years. The change happened in early 1998, when Jobs shocked attendees at San Francisco\u2019s Macworld Expo by revealing that Apple was once again making money. The company\u2019s fortunes dipped and rose a few times before the big recovery started. But Cupertino was once again bound for the top of the tech world.\nThe February 2004 payoff of Apple\u2019s remaining debt hammered home that point.",

        "title": "Apple to release first ARM Mac without Intel processor in next 18 months, predicts Kuo",
        "body": "Ming-Chi Kuo is out with a new analyst note today and the most interesting part of his forecast is that Apple will release its first Mac with an ARM processor in the first half of 2021.\nKuo is predicting that one of Apple\u2019s new products to be released within the next 12-18 months will be a Mac with an in-house processor, instead of using an Intel CPU. There have been growing reports over the last couple of years about Apple making the switch to a custom-designed ARM processor for its Macs and today\u2019s report gives a concrete timeframe for when to expect that launch, which has actually held true since Kuo\u2019s prediction back in 2018.\nSince the coronavirus outbreak, Kuo highlights that Apple has been \u201cmore aggressive\u201d with its funding for research, development, and production of 5nm process chips that are expected to show up in the first Macs with ARM CPUs. That\u2019s because 5nm chips will be integral to iPhone and iPad later this year, as well as Macs come 2021.\n5nm process chip shipments are expected to be taken by Apple in mid-2020. In addition to Apple using the 5nm custom chips for its first ARM Mac in 2021, Kuo says that the flagship 2020 iPhone lineup as well as new mini-LED iPad expect in late 2020 to early 2021 will feature the new 5nm process chips.\nThe change from Intel processors in Macs to custom-designed ARM ones will be a major shift for Apple that will allow it to have more flexibility with Mac hardware updates as well as fine-tuning hardware and software efficiency for the best experience.\nNotably, there will be work ahead for developers as the shift happens to make sure macOS software support is in place for the new wave of ARM Macs.\nDeveloper Steve Troughton-Smith shared that if Kuo\u2019s prediction is correct, this would be the last WWDC before ARM Macs launch and that Apple should be looking to roll out a Developer Transition Kit soon but there\u2019s no guarantee\u2026\nThat would make this WWDC the last WWDC before ARM Macs ship. If there is going to be a Developer Transition Kit this time round, now's the time. Apple gave a six-months heads-up for the Intel switch, provided SDKs and prototype hardware. What will happen this time? https://t.co/ASRVdQGOcM \u2014 Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) February 24, 2020\nThe two scenarios: 1) Apple provides developers the tools to make ARM Mac apps at WWDC 2020 (this year), and gives them up to 12 months lead time\n2) Apple doesn't announce the ARM switch to devs until June 2021, weeks away from end of H1 when these things are supposed to ship \u2014 Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) February 24, 2020\nIf that's really the timeline, then it seems a little crazy to drop an ARM transition on developers as a zero-day in 2021, so they would have to announce it this year and have this WWDC focused on the transition, and it would make sense to have hardware to test on \u2014 Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) February 24, 2020",

        "title": "California Court Says Apple Must Pay Retail Workers for Time Spent Waiting on Bag Searches | 9to5Mac",
        "body": "The California Supreme Court has made a decision in a class-action lawsuit against Apple that dates back to 2013. According to today\u2019s decision, Apple is required to pay its retail workers for the time it takes for their bags to be searched after their shifts.\nApple retail workers filed the class-action suit against Apple in 2013, saying that they were required to submit to search before leaving for the day, including searches of their bags, purses, backpacks, brief cases, and personal Apple devices.\nFor instance, an Apple retail worker\u2019s shift could be over, but they are required to wait for a manager or security officer to perform the search. Employees said they could be forced to wait for as long as 45 minutes, and would not be paid for any of that time.\nA California judge dismissed the class-action suit in 2015, but that decision was appealed. The United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals then asked the California Supreme Court to clarify the law. Today, Bloomberg Law reports that the California Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the workers: Apple violated state law when it didn\u2019t pay for the time spent waiting on mandatory searches at the end of shifts.\nUnder California law, workers are required to be paid of all hours worked. Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye explained that Apple employees \u201care clearly under Apple\u2019s control while awaiting, and during, the exit searches.\u201d\n\u201cThe exit searches burden Apple\u2019s employees by preventing them from leaving the premises with their personal belongings until they undergo an exit search\u2014a process that can take five to 20 minutes to complete\u2014and by compelling them to take specific movements and actions during the search,\u201d the unanimous court said. \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case and the realities of ordinary, 21st century life, we find far-fetched and untenable Apple\u2019s claim that its bag-search policy can be justified as providing a benefit to its employees,\u201d the court said.\nThe court also slammed Apple for its argument that employees could simply leave their personal bags and iPhones at home:\n\u201cIts characterization of the iPhone as unnecessary for its own employees is directly at odds with its description of the iPhone as an \u2018integrated and integral\u2019 part of the lives of everyone else,\u201d the court said, citing statements by company CEO Tim Cook.\nDuring the lawsuit, it was revealed that Tim Cook was largely unaware of the policy of checking employee bags. When two employees complained directly to Cook about the issue, he forwarded the email to his HR executives, asking \u201cIs this true?\u201d\nThe ruling is retroactive, which means Apple could be on the hook for millions of dollars in unpaid employee wages. The case will now return to the Ninth Circuit, where federal judges will apply the interpretation of state law.",

That sounds like it\u2019s going to change when the latest OS updates \u2013 iOS and iPadOS 13.4 and macOS 10.15.4 \u2013 arrive this spring.\nWith universal app support, developers will be able to charge users a single time to grant access to Mac, iPhone, and iPad versions of their app. As Apple\u2019s release notes state, this option in Xcode will be on by default for apps built with Catalyst, but it will also be available to non-Catalyst apps that are offered on the Mac App Store. While this change won\u2019t be the best option for all developers, especially considering the different business dynamics of Mac and iOS apps, it makes sense for iPad developers who bring their apps to the Mac with Catalyst and don\u2019t want to deal with the complication of a separate purchase system.",
