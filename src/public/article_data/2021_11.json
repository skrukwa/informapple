        "title": "Apple announces Self Service Repair",
        "body": "CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced Self Service Repair, which will allow customers who are comfortable with completing their own repairs access to Apple genuine parts and tools. Available first for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups, and soon to be followed by Mac computers featuring M1 chips, Self Service Repair will be available early next year in the US and expand to additional countries throughout 2022. Customers join more than 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASPs) and 2,800 Independent Repair Providers who have access to these parts, tools, and manuals.\nThe initial phase of the program will focus on the most commonly serviced modules, such as the iPhone display, battery, and camera. The ability for additional repairs will be available later next year.\n\u201cCreating greater access to Apple genuine parts gives our customers even more choice if a repair is needed,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cIn the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and training, and now we\u2019re providing an option for those who wish to complete their own repairs.\u201d\nApple builds durable products designed to endure the rigors of everyday use. When an Apple product requires repair, it can be serviced by trained technicians using Apple genuine parts at thousands of locations, including Apple (in-store or by mail), AASPs, Independent Repair Providers, and now product owners who are capable of performing repairs themselves.\nSelf Service Repair\nTo ensure a customer can safely perform a repair, it\u2019s important they first review the Repair Manual. Then a customer will place an order for the Apple genuine parts and tools using the Apple Self Service Repair Online Store. Following the repair, customers who return their used part for recycling will receive credit toward their purchase.\nThe new store will offer more than 200 individual parts and tools, enabling customers to complete the most common repairs on iPhone 12 and iPhone 13.",

        "title": "Tim Cook: Users Who Want to Sideload Apps Can Use Android, While the iPhone Experience Maximizes 'Security and Privacy'",
        "body": "Amid a heightened amount of scrutiny and tension surrounding the App Store and how users download and install apps on the iPhone, Apple CEO Tim Cook said today that customers who wish to sideload apps should consider purchasing an Android device as the experience offered by the \u200ciPhone\u200c maximizes their security and privacy.\nSpeaking at The New York Times \"DealBook\" summit, Cook said that customers currently already have a choice between wanting a secure and protected platform or an ecosystem that allows for sideloading. \"I think that people have that choice today, Andrew. If you want to sideload, you can buy an Android phone.\" Cook drew the comparison of sideloading to a carmaker selling a car without airbags or seatbelt, saying it would be \"too risky.\"\nI think that people have that choice today, Andrew, if you want to sideload, you can buy an Android phone. That choice exists when you go into the carrier shop. If that is important to you, then you should buy an Android phone. From our point of view, it would be like if I were an automobile manufacturer telling [a customer] not to put airbags and seat belts in the car. He would never think about doing this in today's time. It's just too risky to do that. And so it would not be an iPhone if it didn't maximize security and privacy.\nSideloading, which would allow users to download and install apps directly onto their \u200ciPhone\u200c from the open internet, has become a hot topic in recent months, with Cook now weighing in. Earlier this week, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi, said that sideloading is a \"cybercriminal's best friend,\" highlighting the dangers that may be presented to customers if offered the freedom to install apps from anywhere on the web.\nIn a paper published in October, Apple shared some facts about the security and privacy of the \u200ciPhone\u200c compared to the Android ecosystem. In the paper, Apple said that studies have shown that Android smartphones have been attacked by mobile malware between 15 and 47 times more than malware targeting the \u200ciPhone\u200c. \"This is closely linked to sideloading,\" the paper added.\nSpeaking generally on privacy, Cook was questioned on recent reporting revealing that Facebook, Google, Snapchat, and others have lost almost $10 billion in revenue this year due to Apple's App Tracking Transparency prompt, which requires developers to ask for a user's consent before tracking them. Declining to comment on the specific numbers, Cook did repeat that Apple believes privacy is a fundamental human right.\nI don't know about the estimates, Andrew, so I can't testify to those kind of numbers, but I think that from our point of view, privacy is a basic human right. And the people that ought to be deciding whether to data share is the person themselves. And so what we have been all about is putting the power with the user. We are not making the decision, we are just simply prompting them to be asked if they want to be tracked across apps or not. And of course, many of them are deciding no and never wanted to be, it's just that they did not have a choice before. And so I feel really good and I'm getting great feedback from users about having the choice.\nApple is in multiple investigations and battles around the world regarding the \u200cApp Store\u200c, with the one most likely to produce drastic change being South Korea. Last month, the country passed new rules prohibiting platform owners from limiting developers to using only a single payment method for in-app purchases.\nThe \u200cApp Store\u200c's in-app purchase method, which developers are required to use for digital purchases made within apps, gives Apple a 15-30% commission on all purchases made. Cook noted today that Apple has only ever lowered the commission, never increasing it. Nonetheless, the new law in South Korea would represent a significant turning point for the \u200cApp Store\u200c if fully enacted. The \u200cApp Store\u200c operates under a single global set of rules, and any change in one jurisdiction is applied globally for all developers.",

        "body": "An investigation by The Financial Times found that Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube lost around $9.85 billion in revenue following Apple\u2019s changes to its privacy practices. Last year, Apple announced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy that requires apps to ask permission to track users\u2019 data. The policy went into effect in April, barring apps from tracking users if they opt out.\nFacebook notably criticized the move with a full-page newspaper ad, and thanks to the FT\u2019s report, now we know why company leaders were so frustrated. According to the report, Facebook lost the most money \u201cin absolute terms\u201d when compared to other social platforms due to its massive size. Meanwhile, Snap \u201cfared the worst as a percentage of its business\u201d because its advertising is mainly tied to smartphones, which makes sense for a product that doesn\u2019t have a desktop version.\n\u201cSome of the platforms that were most impacted \u2014 but especially Facebook \u2014 have to rebuild their machinery from scratch as a result of ATT,\u201d adtech consultant Eric Seufert told FT. \u201cMy belief is that it takes at least one year to build new infrastructure. New tools and frameworks need to be developed from scratch and tested extensively before being deployed to a high number of users.\u201d",

We heard the disappointment from our existing customers, and we want to correct our course.\nToday, we are making some changes (coming soon in Notability version 11.0.2). Everyone who purchased Notability prior to our switch to subscription on November 1st, 2021 will have lifetime access to all existing features and any content purchased in the app before the 11.0 update.\nThis includes the core Notability experience that users know and love, including unlimited editing, iCloud sync, and any features or content that was previously purchased through the Notability Shop. Future features we develop may also be included, depending on their complexity and cost to maintain.\nWe are a small company, so we designed the original one-year access plan as a precautionary measure since we were not certain if we could support lifetime access.

        "title": "Memory leaks are crippling my M1 MacBook Pro\u2013and I'm not alone",
        "body": "Update 11/7: Since I wrote this column, several Macworld readers have reached out with similar issues on M1 MacBooks. Some readers have had luck with disabling extensions and other have suggested it\u2019s related to Webkit. There are also lengthy Hacker News and Reddit threads with users recounting their experiences.\nFor the past 10 months, I\u2019ve used a 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro supplied by my employer. Most days it\u2019s great, with exceptional battery life and excellent speeds, and is an overall massive upgrade over my previous 2016 model.\nBut some days it\u2019s nearly impossible to get anything done. More than any Mac I\u2019ve owned, this MacBook regularly experiences freezes, crashes, and restarts that often seem to be related to memory issues. It\u2019s been nearly impossible to pinpoint a pattern, but I assumed it was something installed on my machine by my company. After reading numerous reports this week about similar issues, I\u2019m not so sure.\nWhen Gregory McFadden tweeted that Control Center was using 26GB of the 64GB of RAM on his new MacBook Pro, the screenshot looked very familiar. While Control Center never ate up that much RAM for me, I regularly spot spikes when using Safari and Photoshop Elements and have seen more sporadic issues with Mail and other apps. Sometimes the issues cause slowdowns that work themselves out in a few minutes, other times my machine locks up and forces a restart it.\nSo glad I got 64GB of memory on my new Mac so I can use 26GB of it for control center\u2026 Wait\u2026 what. pic.twitter.com/inCOPaii1o \u2014 GregsGadgets (@GregoryMcFadden) October 28, 2021\nI now keep Activity Monitor open while I work and it\u2019s rare that the memory pressure monitor isn\u2019t yellow or red. Like most Mac users, I tend to keep several apps idling in the background\u2014Mail, Music, Safari, Outlook, Word, etc.\u2014but with the M1 MacBook, I often need to quit apps to free up application memory. Closing Safari tabs is a regular task necessary to free up memory and keep my machine running smoothly.\nActivity Monitor often shows my memory pressure in the red. IDG\nThat\u2019s extremely similar to the MacBook Pro and Monterey issues I\u2019ve read this week\u2014except I\u2019m still running Big Sur. That leads me to believe it\u2019s a bigger problem that wasn\u2019t as widely reported until now. Perhaps it\u2019s because developers tend to be more hyper-aware of things like this or it\u2019s exacerbated by the extra RAM in the new MacBook Pro, but the number of people experiencing this issue appears to be growing. And I hope Apple is paying attention.\nMemory loss\nWhen the M1 chip was released, Apple changed the way we think of RAM on our Macs. As in the iPhone and iPad, the memory was now affixed on the same package as the system-on-chip. The M1 Pro and M1 Max come with higher memory options, but the M1 tops out at 16GB and that\u2019s that.\nAs Jason Snell wrote back when the M1 was released, that tidy system has benefits: \u201cThe M1 processor\u2019s memory is a single pool that\u2019s accessible by any portion of the processor. If the system needs more memory for graphics, it can allocate that. If it needs more memory for the Neural Engine, likewise. Even better, because all the aspects of the processor can access all of the system memory, there\u2019s no performance hit when the graphics cores need to access something that was previously being accessed by a processor core. On other systems, the data has to be copied from one portion of memory to another\u2014but on the M1, it\u2019s just instantly accessible.\u201d\nWarnings like these\u2014which I received while I was writing this article\u2014are common. IDG\nIt\u2019s possible that macOS isn\u2019t managing this unified memory structure properly, and will continue to allocate RAM beyond what is available without freeing up RAM that is no longer needed. This is commonly referred to as a \u201cmemory leak.\u201d Performance gradually deteriorates until you need to either wait for the RAM to clear, force-quit the app, or restart the machine.\nSometimes a warning will appear when no single app is even using that much memory and other times apps are seemingly using way more memory than is available. I\u2019ve seen single websites report using as much as 20GB of RAM for no discernible reason, crippling my machine.\nSafari sites spiking memory use happen on a regular basis. IDG\nMaybe now that it\u2019s more of a widespread issue, Apple will figure it out. We\u2019ve reached out to Apple for comment but haven\u2019t heard back, and it\u2019s entirely possible that Apple fixes it in a future version of macOS without ever addressing the issue publicly. That\u2019s what happened with the excessive SSD usage earlier this year, though that Apple says that was a \u201cdata reporting error\u201d and not an actual problem. The memory bug is an actual issue that needs to be fixed as soon as possible.\nIn the meantime, there are a few ways to mitigate the issue. The first is to be vigilant. As I said, keep Activity Monitor open, and when you see an app\u2019s memory usage creeping up, address it. You can also use a third-party memory cleaner that lets you quickly clear RAM. Running that periodically will help keep your resources available. And finally, stay up to date with the latest version of Big Sur or Monterey, as a fix will hopefully arrive soon.",

        "body": "It took Apple less than a year to seemingly start undoing decades of x86 and Intel dominance in the traditional PC chip market.\nThe Cupertino-based iMonster provided the boost needed for Arm-compatible chips to take noticeable desktop and laptop processor market share away from x86, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research.\nArm's market share in PC chips was about eight per cent during Q3 this year, climbing steadily from seven per cent in Q2, and up from only two per cent in Q3 2020, before Arm-compatible M1 Macs went on sale.\nApple is gradually dropping Intel's processors from Macs in favor of its homegrown Arm-flavored processors. Arm's PC market share growth was mostly powered by strong Macs sales, McCarron confirmed.\n\"Apple transitioned much more quickly than anyone expected,\" McCarron said, adding the Arm share numbers also included shipments of Arm processors in Chromebooks.\nApple transitioned much more quickly than anyone expected\nArm's PC processor market share will continue to expand as consumers upgrade Intel-based Macs to ones with Apple's chips, McCarron said. That market share growth may level off once the Mac upgrade cycle slows down, but that remains to be seen, he added.\nSales of Chromebooks with Arm chips have slowed, and Windows PC users are not switching over to Arm-based laptops with chips from Qualcomm. The numbers reinforce Apple's strength as a silicon design powerhouse. The super-corp has also gone through its fair share of personal computer CPU architectures, notably from 6502 to 68000 to PowerPC to x86, and not only has experience with these transitions but has been designing its own Arm cores for years.\nIn another corner, Intel is being pecked away at by x86 rival AMD, which has been taking market share away since its Ryzen chips starting appearing in PCs, and Epyc microprocessors in servers, in 2017. Perhaps AMD undersold itself with its Buster Douglas analogy at the launch of its Zen family.\nAnd in the background to this, there's the ongoing popularity of Arm-powered single-board computers, primarily the Raspberry Pi, potentially providing alternative systems to traditional PCs.\nAMD had a 24.6 per cent x86 processor market share \u2013 servers, PCs, and games consoles included \u2013 in Q3 this year, growing from 22.5 per cent a year ago, according to Mercury. Intel's share declined to 75.4 per cent in Q3, compared to a 77.6 per cent share in the year-ago quarter.\nBreaking down Mercury's numbers further, AMD's desktop share went from 20.1 per cent in Q3 2020 down to 17 per cent in Q3 2021, though laptops and other mobile PCs climbed from 20.2 per cent to 22.0 per cent. Servers jumped from 6.6 per cent to 10.2 percent.\nWith Ryzen and Epyc parts, AMD measures up to Intel with a full stack of offerings from entry-level personal computers to gaming boxen to servers. Before Ryzen, AMD was mainly competing on the low-end to mid-range with Intel chips such as the Pentium and Core i3.\n\"It's not so much they are lagging; AMD went from a modestly competitive to a more significant competitive,\" McCarron said.\nFacebook, which wants to be known as Meta, recently announced it would use AMD chips in its data centers to power its latest and greatest microservers.\nIntel's newest Alder Lake x86 family, introduced last month, could slow down market-share loss to AMD. Intel's general-purpose processors are also facing competition from accelerators like GPUs, FPGAs, and custom silicon optimized for particular workloads.\nDuring Q3, the supply-chain crunch led chipmakers to prioritize their more profitable, high-margin processor, and the CPU product mix for PCs leaned toward higher-end systems.\n\"That pretty much drives processor suppliers to focus on high-end products, like a Core i9 or i7 versus a Celeron,\" McCarron said.\nThe focus on high-end processors and a corresponding decline in demand for Chromebooks hurt entry-level PC chips in Q3. Chromebooks were popular in the early days of the pandemic as people sought systems to use wherever they ended up working or studying, and that market demand was satisfied in Q2 this year, McCarron said.\nDuring the Chromebook boom, Intel's Celeron and an AMD non-Zen product code-named Stoney Ridge \u2013 the A4-9120C chip \u2013 shipped in the millions. It's hard to determine when demand for Chromebooks will return, McCarron said. \u00ae",

        "title": "Apple @ Work: It's time for Apple to debut a 'Pro' email app for business professionals",
        "body": "Apple @ Work is brought to you by Mosyle, the leader in modern mobile device management (MDM) and security for Apple enterprise and education customers. Over 22,000 organizations leverage Mosyle solutions to automate the management and security of millions of Apple devices daily. Request a FREE account today and discover how you can put your Apple fleet on auto-pilot at a price point that is hard to believe.\nI became a Mac user in 2004 thanks to a recommendation by a coworker at the time. My first Mac was the 12\u2033 PowerBook running OS X Panther. One of the first apps I used was Mail.app running my .Mac email address (which still works as it transitioned to MobileMe and eventually iCloud). Email is one of the most-used apps on people\u2019s computers as it\u2019s still the primary business communication device. However, the problem with the Mail app in 2021 is that it\u2019s not that much different than it was 16 years ago. So, similar to how Microsoft has Outlook and Windows Mail, is it time for Apple to create Apple Mail Pro and Apple Mail Lite for macOS and iOS?\nAbout Apple @ Work: Bradley Chambers has been managing an enterprise IT network since 2009. Through his experience deploying and managing firewalls, switches, a mobile device management system, enterprise-grade Wi-Fi, 100s of Macs, and 100s of iPads, Bradley will highlight ways in which Apple IT managers deploy Apple devices, build networks to support them, train users, stories from the trenches of IT management, and ways Apple could improve its products for IT departments.\nThere are so many features that other mail apps like Spark, Spike, Two-Bird, Hey, and even Outlook offer compared to Apple Mail\u2019s feature set that it\u2019s beginning to look bare compared to alternatives. However, as I mentioned at the beginning, Apple Mail is likely one of the most popular apps on macOS and iOS, so if they wanted to keep them simple for novice users, they could rename it Apple Mail Lite and then go to work on a Pro version that would be ideal for businesses users and prosumers. So here are some of the features I\u2019d love to see offered:\nScheduled Send \u2013 Send Later\nIn a world where remote and hybrid work is quickly becoming the default, I\u2019d love to see Apple implement some Scheduled Send feature in a Pro version of the Apple Mail app. Scheduled Send is an excellent feature for when you\u2019re catching up on work over the weekend, or you know a coworker is out of the office. Instead of sending the email right then \u2013 a scheduled send function would allow you to write it and then schedule it to be delivered later.\nSnooze Message Functionality\nSnooze is commonplace across email apps today, and I\u2019ve yet to figure out why Apple hasn\u2019t implemented it. If you get an email that you know you won\u2019t have the mental energy or time to deal with right now, you could snooze it to a different time to clear your inbox for the moment. This feature is in almost every other email app I\u2019ve tried over the past few years.\nIntegrated Task API\nApple has built the Reminders app to be a robust app that can almost replace Todoist or Things. However, I\u2019d like to see Apple take it a step further and build out a Task API for its Pro Mail app to manage my tasks from Todoist or Things without leaving my email app.\nIntegrated Calendar API\nI love having a dedicated calendar app, but I\u2019d like to see Apple give visibility into my calendar from my email app. Similar to a Task API, a Calendar API would let apps like Fantastical and Apple\u2019s Calendar app show your upcoming schedule, see how invites affect your daily schedule, etc. The idea is to create a single window for Email and Calendar similar to how Outlook functions.\nMail app add-Ons\nA final way Apple could extend its Pro email app is to build an \u201cemail app store\u201d similar to what they did with iMessage apps. It would be a way for countless other apps to build their own integrations and mail add-ons.\nSmart filtering\nThe volume of email I get keeps going up, so I\u2019d love for Apple to build intelligence into its Mail app to help categorize messages similar to how Spark\u2019s Smart Inbox and Spike\u2019s Priority Inbox to help focus on the most important emails while ignoring receipts, newsletter, etc. until a later time.\nWhat else?\nWhat else should Apple add to a Pro version of its email app? I think there is a model for an App Store within an app overall. Email is such a core part of our work experience that there is room to innovate by letting you pull in calendars, tasks, contacts, RSS, etc., into your mail app.\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash",

        "body": "Jewelsummoner ,\nHonestly, I really love using this app! It is very well thought out and I can use it for many different kinds of workflows. Great app if you are considering starting/ transitioning to digital note-taking/ journaling. I enjoy taking handwritten notes in it with my apple pencil and being able to easily import pdfs that I can mark up is great. I enjoy the elements feature, which allows me to add custom sticker that I use all the time as post-its or stickers for journaling. Plus there are som many other excellent features, such as being able to search in your hand written notes and the ability to back-up your notebooks, to name a few.\nI only have one pet peeve when it comes to this app. It does have a typing feature, but it\u2019s a bit clunky and not very intuitive. When I am doing journaling, it is very nice to put text exactly where I want it, so I don\u2019t want the feature to go away. But having to use the text boxes for more type-intensive tasks can be a bit annoying at times. I would be nice if there was a feature you could enable within the notebook where if you could type in a notebook like a normal word document. My work around is typing something ahead of time in a word document and then importing it into the app, but honestly, it would be nice if I didn\u2019t have to do that (maybe I am being too picky)\u2026 Otherwise, this a really excellent, solid app that I recommend highly to folks for note-taking.",

        "body": "An update to Google Messages on Android allows it to properly display emoji reactions sent from the iPhone\u2019s Messages app, 9to5Google reports.\nThe update addresses a long-standing issue that occurs when users of Apple\u2019s iMessage service chat with friends using the Messages app on Android. Previously, when an iPhone user reacted to an Android user\u2019s message using an emoji, it appeared as a separate text message when received on Android, often resulting in confusion and lots of unnecessary clutter.\nThe old method generated a separate message for each reaction. Screenshot: Google Messages The new approach is much cleaner. Screenshot: 9to5Google\nAfter the update, however, the message flow is a lot simpler. Screenshots posted by 9to5Google show how the emoji reactions appear attached to the intended text, as though they were sent by another Google Messages user. Tapping on an emoji reaction displays a popup saying that it\u2019s been \u201cTranslated from iPhone.\u201d\nInterestingly, emoji reactions sent from iPhone seem to sometimes appear as different emoji on Android. The heart emoji, for example, reportedly appears as heart-eyes on Android. iPhone users can also retroactively change their emoji reaction, and the change will be reflected seamlessly in the Android app.",

        "body": "After cutting its California self-driving test fleet to 54 in May, Apple has been consistently expanding the number of drivers as months go by. Now, the company has 137 drivers. As spotted by macReports with numbers from the California DMV, Apple is slowly going closer to the number of drivers it had last October: 154.\nUnfortunately, one number that doesn\u2019t change at all is how many self-driving vehicles the company has. This number has been at 69 since August.\nAccording to the California DMV, Apple has yet to apply for a driverless permit, as there are several manufacturers who have driverless permits for their fleets.\nSince the latest report, in which Apple had two more collision counts with its autonomous vehicles, it has reported one additional collision. In total, the company now counts six collisions.\nAlthough Apple keeps working on its self-driving technology, it\u2019s still unclear when it will become publicly announced as the Apple Car. A couple of months ago, the company announced that its VP Doug Field was stepping down from the Apple Car project for a new gig at Ford and that Apple\u2019s Kevin Lynch was taking over the Project Titan.\nRumors about the Apple Car also maintain the mystery as a sketchy report suggested that Apple is now developing its car alone to avoid further delays.\nIn this report, Mail Economic Daily said that Apple has \u201chundred of vehicle-related engineers,\u201d and it\u2019s selecting final parts suppliers for its project.\nIn August, Korea Times reported that Apple was in talks to develop its electric car with a Korean partner, as the company wouldn\u2019t be able to complete its EV business plan without partnerships with the country\u2019s vendor.\nAs for now, it\u2019s still unclear what Apple plans to create with its Apple Car project, whether it\u2019s a car for retail sales, a ride-sharing car, or even just a technology for other vehicles. Its launch is also unclear, with reports saying it could be unveiled any time in this decade.\nRead our full roundup about the Apple Car here.\nRelated:",

The company boasts former Apple engineers who worked on Apple silicon, and in July Qualcomm chief executive Cristiano Amon said he thought Qualcomm could have the best chip on the market by next year. According to Thompson today, the new chips will be unveiled in about nine months, and be ready for devices in 2023.\nIt is expected by then that Apple will be on to the second generation of its own Apple silicon, with a new 'M2' chip expected next year that delivers even more improvements on the power-to-performance ratio that the M1 gave when it was unveiled in 2020. Apple announced the juiced-up M1 Pro and M1 Max in the new MacBook Pro (2021) last month.",

        "title": "Apple iMac Pro to come with a 20-core M1 Max Duo SoC that combines two M1 Max dies",
        "body": "According to a report, Apple is set to launch the next-generation 27-inch iMac Pro with the M1 Max Duo, an SoC that features 20 CPU and 64 GPU cores with up to 128 GB of RAM. Apparently, Apple will achieve this by combining two M1 Max dies onto a single chip.\n4 Reviews\nLast month, Mark Gurman reminded people of Apple's plans to release even more powerful in-house SoCs for the Mac Pro. As he reported earlier this year, Apple is thought to have developed SoCs with up to 40 CPU cores and 128 GPU cores, 4x the volume of CPU and GPU cores that the M1 Max offers.\nReputedly, Apple has a lesser SoC with 20 CPU cores in development too, which is tipped by AAPL Tree and Max Tech to appear in a 27-inch iMac Pro. Supposedly, Apple will bolt two M1 Max dies onto one SoC, allowing it to offer 128 GB RAM support, currently a feature of the Intel-based 27-inch iMac.\nThe so-called M1 Max Duo would also have double the GPU performance (TFLOPs) of the M1X and its 32-core GPU. As Max Tech discusses below, the M1 Max is more powerful than the RX 5700 XT in the 27-inch iMac, but not by enough of a margin that could be considered a generational leap. Theoretically, offering double the GPU performance of the M1 Max would achieve this.\nAdditionally, the M1 Max cannot compete with the CPU performance offered by the Core i7-10700K or the Core i9-10910. Hence, equipping a 27-inch iMac with the M1 Max would be a downgrade in terms of CPU and GPU performance. Offering a second M1 Max on the same chip could help Apple bridge that CPU gap, too.\nIncidentally, Hector Martin, who is porting Linux for Apple Silicon Macs, has discovered 'plenty of multi-die references' in macOS. Additionally, he states that Apple has designed the M1 Pro and M1 Max's Interrupt request (IRQ) controllers with second halves for a second die. Currently, this second half is unused.",

        "body": "Despite its failed AirPower experiment a few years ago, Apple is reportedly still working on a multi-device charger for its products. According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple is developing a multi-device charger, as well as short and long distance wireless charging technology for its idea of a future where all major devices \u201ccan charge each other.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Bloomberg has reported on Apple\u2019s work developing a multi-device inductive charging solution. Back in June, the publication reported that Apple was developing a multi-device inductive charging mat as sort-of a spiritual success to the failed AirPower experiment.\nIn the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman writes that Apple is still working on this multi-device charger. This would be different than the existing MagSafe Duo, which is really just separate iPhone and Apple Watch chargers stitched together.\nApple is also continuing to work on short and long distance wireless charging solutions, Gurman says. This sort of technology is truly wireless charging, unlike the current inductive \u201cwireless\u201d charging technology available today.\nFurthermore, Gurman says that he believes Apple \u201cimagines a future\u201d where each of its major products can charge each other. For instance, an iPhone could eventually charge AirPods or an Apple Watch:\nI do think Apple is still working on some sort of multi-device charger that it intends to eventually release. There\u2019s a reason why it planned to launch the device in the first place in 2017. I also believe Apple is working on short and long distance wireless charging devices and that it imagines a future where all of Apple\u2019s major devices can charge each other. Imagine an iPad charging an iPhone and then that iPhone charging AirPods or an Apple Watch.\nSo-called reverse wireless charging has been a rumored feature for the iPhone for several years, but ultimately has not come to fruition. In theory, this would allow people to place their AirPods or Apple Watch on the back of their iPhone to charge them on the go.\nWhat do you think of the future of Apple\u2019s wireless charging ambitions?

        "title": "It\u2019s time Apple gave a damn about gaming",
        "body": "Sure, Steam is available on Mac and there are some AAA titles up for grabs from the App Store, but let\u2019s be honest, Apple\u2019s gaming pedigree practically disappeared when Halo vanished after its Macworld debut in 1999. Master Chief\u2019s move to the Xbox felt like a death knell for it all. Since then, every Mac review has always come with one caveat: don\u2019t buy one if you want to game.\nThat\u2019s a shame because Apple Arcade is one of the best value gaming subscription services, and the most underrated, too. The range of titles Apple chose shows the team has the intuition needed for curating a good catalogue.\nAnd now, to paraphrase Nintendo\u2019s classic marketing catchphrase: the company is really playing with power thanks to the M1 Pro and M1 Max. These chips pack up to 32 GPU cores, which practically match laptops with top-of-the-range dedicated graphics cards. You can see just how great they are by reading our 14-inch MacBook Pro review .\nLooking to buy a 14-inch MacBook Pro ? Here are the best places to shop for one\n? Here are the best places to shop for one And if you want the extra size up, here is where to buy a 16-inch MacBook Pro\nBut these numbers were purely for prosumer productivity, such as Final Cut exports. Since their launch, one question has been answered by a lot of YouTubers: how do they perform for games?\nAnd the answer is a solid \u201cOK.\u201d The library of games that run natively on Apple silicon is extremely limited, with the only example being World of Warcraft, which runs incredibly well. x86 games (games built for Intel Macs) that run through Rosetta 2\u2019s emulation layer are playable, but are nowhere near as graphically rich and smooth as what you could get from an RTX 3080 laptop.\nLet\u2019s take ZONEofTECH\u2019s gaming test video as an example. Starcraft 2 on ultra settings runs at just 20 frames per second, which is abysmal compared to equivalent Windows laptops. And while devs share a small part of the blame (these games have not been updated to run natively on the M1), Apple hasn\u2019t made the Mac an enticing place for people to game.\nHowever, that\u2019s what creative pros desire. We want an all-in-one system that crushes creative work but is able to play games: your classic \u201cwork by day, play by night\u201d scenario. While the new MacBook Pros nail that first bit, they don\u2019t come close to achieving that second part, and Apple should really fix that.\nWhat do I want?\nI\u2019ve read a million other \u201chot take\u201d pieces like these and have always been left disappointed by the lack of recommended actions Apple could take. If I\u2019m complaining about something, I want to be constructive and provide a solution.\nAnd the three-step solution here is ambitious, but simple on paper:\nExpand Apple Arcade: The easiest fix of the three \u2014 add another Apple Arcade tier that covers MacBook Pro gaming with some more traditional big budget titles. Basically, make the Apple version of Xbox Game Pass for PC. Encourage M1 Pro/M1 Max game development: The power and GPU cores already do really well running games through Rosetta 2. Imagine how they\u2019d perform when optimized for M1. Snap up some exclusives: The name of the game is system-exclusive titles and Apple has a tonne of cash to buy some big ones for its own platform.\nCome on, Apple. Now that you have proven your own silicon is powerful enough to hang with the likes of RTX 3080 systems on the productivity side, it\u2019s time to unlock the true gaming potential. It\u2019s time to turn every Mac into the all-in-one system they already have the power to be.",

        "title": "Apple sues NSO Group to curb the abuse of state-sponsored spyware",
        "body": "CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today filed a lawsuit against NSO Group and its parent company to hold it accountable for the surveillance and targeting of Apple users. The complaint provides new information on how NSO Group infected victims\u2019 devices with its Pegasus spyware. To prevent further abuse and harm to its users, Apple is also seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices.\nNSO Group creates sophisticated, state-sponsored surveillance technology that allows its highly targeted spyware to surveil its victims. These attacks are only aimed at a very small number of users, and they impact people across multiple platforms, including iOS and Android. Researchers and journalists have publicly documented a history of this spyware being abused to target journalists, activists, dissidents, academics, and government officials.1\n\u201cState-sponsored actors like the NSO Group spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability. That needs to change,\u201d said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Software Engineering. \u201cApple devices are the most secure consumer hardware on the market \u2014 but private companies developing state-sponsored spyware have become even more dangerous. While these cybersecurity threats only impact a very small number of our customers, we take any attack on our users very seriously, and we\u2019re constantly working to strengthen the security and privacy protections in iOS to keep all our users safe.\u201d\nNSO Group\u2019s FORCEDENTRY Exploit\nApple\u2019s legal complaint provides new information on NSO Group\u2019s FORCEDENTRY, an exploit for a now-patched vulnerability previously used to break into a victim\u2019s Apple device and install the latest version of NSO Group\u2019s spyware product, Pegasus. The exploit was originally identified by the Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto.\nThe spyware was used to attack a small number of Apple users worldwide with dangerous malware and spyware. Apple\u2019s lawsuit seeks to ban NSO Group from further harming individuals by using Apple\u2019s products and services. The lawsuit also seeks redress for NSO Group\u2019s flagrant violations of US federal and state law, arising out of its efforts to target and attack Apple and its users.\nNSO Group and its clients devote the immense resources and capabilities of nation-states to conduct highly targeted cyberattacks, allowing them to access the microphone, camera, and other sensitive data on Apple and Android devices. To deliver FORCEDENTRY to Apple devices, attackers created Apple IDs to send malicious data to a victim\u2019s device \u2014 allowing NSO Group or its clients to deliver and install Pegasus spyware without a victim\u2019s knowledge. Though misused to deliver FORCEDENTRY, Apple servers were not hacked or compromised in the attacks.\nApple makes the most secure mobile devices on the market, and constantly invests in strengthening privacy and security protections for its users. For example, researchers have found that other mobile platforms have 15 times more malware infections than iPhone,2 and a recent study showed that less than 2 percent of mobile malware targets iOS devices.3\niOS 15 includes a number of new security protections, including significant upgrades to the BlastDoor security mechanism. While NSO Group spyware continues to evolve, Apple has not observed any evidence of successful remote attacks against devices running iOS 15 and later versions. Apple urges all users to update their iPhone and always use the latest software.\n\u201cAt Apple, we are always working to defend our users against even the most complex cyberattacks. The steps we\u2019re taking today will send a clear message: In a free society, it is unacceptable to weaponize powerful state-sponsored spyware against those who seek to make the world a better place,\u201d said Ivan Krsti\u0107, head of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture. \u201cOur threat intelligence and engineering teams work around the clock to analyze new threats, rapidly patch vulnerabilities, and develop industry-leading new protections in our software and silicon. Apple runs one of the most sophisticated security engineering operations in the world, and we will continue to work tirelessly to protect our users from abusive state-sponsored actors like NSO Group.\u201d\nApple\u2019s Continuing Efforts to Protect Its Users\nApple commends groups like the Citizen Lab and Amnesty Tech for their groundbreaking work to identify cybersurveillance abuses and help protect victims. To further strengthen efforts like these, Apple will be contributing $10 million, as well as any damages from the lawsuit, to organizations pursuing cybersurveillance research and advocacy.\nApple will also support the accomplished researchers at the Citizen Lab with pro-bono technical, threat intelligence, and engineering assistance to aid their independent research mission, and where appropriate, will offer the same assistance to other organizations doing critical work in this space.\n\u201cMercenary spyware firms like NSO Group have facilitated some of the world\u2019s worst human rights abuses and acts of transnational repression, while enriching themselves and their investors,\u201d said Ron Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. \u201cI applaud Apple for holding them accountable for their abuses, and hope in doing so Apple will help to bring justice to all who have been victimized by NSO Group\u2019s reckless behavior.\u201d\nApple is notifying the small number of users that it discovered may have been targeted by FORCEDENTRY. Any time Apple discovers activity consistent with a state-sponsored spyware attack, Apple will notify the affected users in accordance with industry best practices.",

        "body": "We all know the drill. As Apple's annual fall event draws close, many of us start to check in on our previous two-year smartphone plan to see if we're eligible for an upgrade in September. After all, the newest phone is only the newest phone for so long. Even for discerning shoppers like me, it takes serious willpower to resist the lure of a purple iPhone or 1TB of storage.\nMobile carriers have long persuaded many of us to upgrade our smartphones every two years, offering two-year contracts linked to free or low-cost phone upgrades to keep the two-year upgrade cycle going. That feeling of ponying up just a couple hundred dollars (or less) for the newest, fanciest phone available has helped perpetuate the rise of the de facto two-year phone upgrade. Case in point: AT&T and Verizon marketed a \"free\" iPhone 12 last year for customers who buy unlimited plans and commit to a multiyear deal. And the trade-in deals were even better this year for the iPhone 13.\nBut even though that might still be the norm in the US, a routine upgrade isn't a thing for much of the world.\nI was born and raised in developing Asia, a region where buying a smartphone is financially unattainable for hundreds of millions of people, much less a two-year upgrade. In India, the average person needs to save two months' salary to buy the cheapest available smartphone, according to a survey published by the Alliance for Affordable Internet last August. From my perspective, the trend of routinely upgrading a phone every two years when it doesn't change that much is a privilege, one that reminds me of the stark income equality gap as well as the ever-increasing digital divide globally.\nRead more: Billions of people still can't afford smartphones: That's a major problem\nBeyond that, and perhaps more tangibly, I think we should consider the environmental cost of purchasing a new phone. You've read the headlines: Climate change is accelerating at rapid speed. Countries around the world keep setting new records for the highest temperatures. There are more climate-related disasters than ever before, arctic caps are melting and biodiversity is disappearing faster than we can save it. What, exactly, happens to all those discarded phones over time? Does all that plastic ever fully decompose?\nApple says it removed the in-box charger from its iPhone 12 lineup for environmental reasons. Apple\nRead more: Apple is opening up its world of iPhone recycling\nConsumer electronics are responsible for tonnes of e-waste annually, which in turn contributes to the climate crisis. Experts have warned about how e-waste disposal contributes to climate change due to the chemicals released when the waste is burned, some of which are equivalent to carbon dioxide.\nFor years, developed countries like the US have shipped recyclable waste overseas for processing. Although that is now beginning to change, there are real costs. iPhones contain toxic materials like lead and mercury, for instance, which can harm the environment and people if disposed of improperly. And often e-waste isn't properly managed. In Southern China, there is a town called Guiyu that has become known as the world's biggest graveyard for America's electronic junk, and synonymous among environmentalists with toxic waste. The UN's 2020 Global E-waste Monitor report found that the world dumped a record 53.6 million tonnes of e-waste last year, of which the US is the world's second-largest contributor to e-waste, dumping 6.9 million tonnes.\nRead more: I paid $69 to replace my iPhone battery: Here's what happened\nWhile Apple is committed to a net zero supply chain by 2030, it's tough to argue that there's a better alternative to lower carbon consumption than less consumption. After all, Apple says the iPhone 12's end-to-end supply chain emits 70 kilograms of carbon to the atmosphere. If even 1 million people waited that extra year, we could save 70,000,000 kilograms of carbon from going into the air in a year. Imagine if it was 10 million or 100 million. It's something to think about before making that upgrade.\nThe smartphone upgrade cycle has gotten longer\nEven with the enticing deals offered by carriers, the upgrade cycle has seemingly lengthened. In recent years, several reports show how Americans and Europeans are more than happy to hold on to their phones for longer periods of time. In fact, in 2019 smartphone upgrades hit record lows at two of the biggest US carriers, Verizon and AT&T. Carriers like T-Mobile and Verizon seem to have responded to this by offering month-to-month plans, which offer more flexibility and options, indicating a potential departure from the \"norm\" of a two-year phone upgrade.\nBarring big-picture factors like the struggling global economy amid the ongoing pandemic as well as our increased mindfulness over the environment, I think this trend is persisting for a confluence of reasons. Phones today are receiving software, and therefore security, updates for longer. For instance, 2015's iPhone 6S is compatible with iOS 15, potentially dampening desires for a bi-yearly upgrade.\nIn addition to all this, smartphone innovation has hit a plateau, and the industry bears the hallmarks of one that's maturing: slowing smartphone sales growth along with the slower evolution of what we need, what we want and so forth. There are no big surprises here: Today's phones are getting more nice-to-have refinements rather than the awe-inspiring innovation seen just three or four years ago.\nDecreasing technological gap\nUp until a couple of years ago, smartphone manufacturers had us sitting on the edge of our seats, waiting for the next design refresh. But that's not as much the case anymore. With the iPhone 12 series, 5G was probably its buzziest feature -- one that understandably ended up triggering an upgrade supercycle. But the most exciting thing for many of us at CNET was MagSafe, which is hardly new. Apple's proprietary technology, allowing you to magnetically snap on attachments, was first introduced some 15 years ago with the first-gen MacBook Pro. It was then reintroduced for the iPhone 12.\nPatrick Holland/CNET\nWhen you look at what changed from the iPhone 11, you'll see the usual suspects on your list: 5G, OLED screen, new design. Admittedly there are a few more things you won't see everywhere, such as MagSafe and the Ceramic Shield, but nothing extra-special to truly write home about. Personally, the last time I was blown away by an iPhone reveal was back in 2017 when Apple introduced the iPhone X, which set new design standards for the modern-day iPhone. The iPhone X did away with the physical home button and chunky bezels of its predecessors and made way for a sleek, futuristic device that inspired the iPhone 12 family. Also, for the first time with Apple, we were able to unlock an iPhone with Face ID, Apple's facial recognition technology.\nLooking at the iPhone 13, the narrative sounds familiar. We knew it wouldn't get a major technical upgrade (though that didn't stop us from wishing). While we appreciate the upgrades Apple did give the phone (a smaller notch, a larger battery and a faster screen refresh rate), the iPhone 13 is \"not radically different,\" according to CNET's Patrick Holland. Plus a number of these new iPhone features, like the 120Hz screen, currently exist on Android phones, reinforcing the notion of a decreasing technological gap in the smartphone landscape. Apple itself says the life-cycle of a typical iPhone is now three years. So the company times its new releases accordingly: We get a major redesign every three years, not two, with more minor updates in between.\nLook no further than the glitziest non-Apple flagship launch of this year for clues: Samsung's Galaxy S21 family. Here the standout change wasn't made to the hardware or software, but perhaps to its least interesting feature: its price tag. The S21 lineup has a starting price of $800 (\u00a3769, AU$1,249), which is $200 less than last year's $1,000 Galaxy S20, making for an enticing deal.\nApart from that, major differences between the S21 and last year's S20 were mostly incremental. I remember having to pore over the specs sheet to spot salient differences as I covered Samsung's virtual Unpacked event. Refinements were made to the usual suspects, including the processor, software and 5G. This might have been part of Samsung's response to the global coronavirus pandemic, but again it lends credence to the notion of that decreasing technological gap. It was also interesting to note the items Samsung dropped from the S21 flagship family to meet that lowered price. We said goodbye to expandable storage, bundled earphones and most notoriously the in-box charger, as Samsung followed in Apple's lead -- apparently in the name of the environment.\nRead more: Here's what we know so far about Samsung's Galaxy S22\nLet's also take a moment to consider the question: What makes the S21 an attractive buy? Chances are, a great camera, fast performance, battery longevity and a crisp display with narrow bezels are at the top of your list. But the truth is 2019's Galaxy S10 boasts all those features. Heck, even the Galaxy S7 from five years ago did. My point is yearly changes have become too incremental to compel most people to upgrade with urgency, especially given the backdrop of rising smartphone prices.\nSamsung's Galaxy Z Flip. Angela Lang/CNET\nAre we at peak phone?\nI'm not discounting foldable phones. Samsung and Huawei have made undeniable technological progress, and their bendy handsets have dramatically altered the way smartphones are used and could represent the future of the industry. But folding phones are far from the mainstream. Phone manufacturers and carriers in the US have moved the most innovative devices to a price that's simply beyond reach for most people. For instance, the Galaxy Fold 3 starts at $1,800 (\u00a31,599, AU$2,499) and Huawei's Mate X2, available in China for now, costs nearly $3,000 ($2,800, \u00a31,985, AU$3,640 converted). Until these prices hit price parity with, say, the iPhone 12 Pro or Pro Max, foldable phones are likely to remain a niche product.\nSmartphone innovation has stagnated, and this is not a knock against the consumer electronics companies or the tech giants that design them. Maybe we've reached peak smartphone, and this is as far as it needs to go. It could well be part of the reason why the race to upgrade your phones is slowing.",

        "body": "Your Data and Privacy When you \u2018Ask app not to track,\u2019 some iPhone apps keep snooping anyway To test Apple\u2019s privacy protections, we watched the data flow out of 10 popular apps. (Ran Zheng for The Washington Post) (Ran Zheng for The Washington Post)\nListen 13 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\nOn your iPhone, you can now tap a button that says, \u201cAsk app not to track.\u201d But behind the scenes, some apps keep snooping anyway. Say you open the app \u201cSubway Surfers,\u201d listed as one of the App Store\u2019s \u201cmust-play\u201d games. It asks if you\u2019re okay with the app \u201ctracking\u201d you, a question iPhones started displaying in April as part of a privacy crackdown by Apple. Saying no is supposed to stop apps such as \u201cSubway Surfers\u201d and Facebook from learning about what you do in other apps and websites.\nBut something curious happens after you ask not to be tracked, according to an investigation by researchers at privacy software maker Lockdown and The Washington Post. \u201cSubway Surfers\u201d starts sending an outside ad company called Chartboost 29 very specific data points about your iPhone, including your Internet address, your free storage, your current volume level (to 3 decimal points) and even your battery level (to 15 decimal points). It\u2019s the kind of unique data that could be used by advertisers to identify your iPhone, possibly letting them know what other apps you use or how to target you.\nIn other words, it\u2019s sidestepping your request to be left alone. You can\u2019t stop it. And your privacy is worse off for it.\nAdvertisement\nApple\u2019s rules say apps aren\u2019t allowed to track people who say they don\u2019t want it. So why is this happening? Privacy advocates say this kind of data-gathering is likely tracking, just by a different name: fingerprinting.\nOur investigation found the iPhone\u2019s tracking protections are nowhere nearly as comprehensive as Apple\u2019s advertising might suggest. We found at least three popular iPhone games share a substantial amount of identifying information with ad companies, even after being asked not to track.\n\u201cApple believes that tracking should be transparent to users and under their control,\u201d said spokesman Fred Sainz. \u201cIf we discover that a developer is not honoring the user\u2019s choice, we will work with the developer to address the issue, or they will be removed from the App Store.\u201d\nWhen we flagged our findings to Apple, it said it was reaching out to these companies to understand what information they are collecting and how they are sharing it. After several weeks, nothing appears to have changed.\nWhat happens when you ask not to be tracked\nApple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency initiative has prompted big app makers such as Facebook and Zynga to complain it could hurt their profits. But that doesn\u2019t mean it has stopped all tracking.\nTo find out what happens when you tap \u201cask app not to track,\u201d Lockdown said it tested 10 popular apps on an iPhone running iOS 14.8 and again with the newest iOS 15, analyzing what personal information flowed out of them.\nAs part of a technical change that arrived with iOS 14.5, the apps were no longer able to access one valuable piece of data: a kind of Social Security number for your iPhone, known as the ID for Advertisers, or IDFA. But there\u2019s other information that can identify your phone beyond that number.\nAdvertisement\nLockdown found most of the apps continued to communicate behind the scenes with a murky industry of third-party data companies that privacy advocates call trackers. You\u2019ve probably never heard of most of them, but they can receive a flood of information from your iPhone, potentially revealing how you use apps and even your location. Their uses for the data could be benign, like helping an app find bugs and track how well its design works \u2014 or they could be feeding your information to advertisers and data brokers.\nAmong the apps Lockdown investigated, tapping the \u201cdon\u2019t track\u201d button made no difference at all to the total number of third-party trackers the apps reached out to. And the number of times the apps attempted to send out data to these companies declined just 13 percent.\n\u201cWhen it comes to stopping third-party trackers, App Tracking Transparency is a dud. Worse, giving users the option to tap an \u2018Ask App Not To Track\u2019 button may even give users a false sense of privacy,\u201d said Lockdown co-founder Johnny Lin, a former Apple iCloud engineer.\nEven more worrisome for consumers, Lockdown said three of the apps it investigated \u2014 \u201cSubway Surfers,\u201d \u201cStreamer Life!\u201d and \u201cRun Rich 3D\u201d \u2014 appeared to be collecting data that could be used for a more invasive kind of tracking known as digital fingerprinting.\nFingerprinting happens when an app takes innocent-looking but technical information from your iPhone, like the volume, battery level and IP address. Combined, those details create a picture of your phone that can be as unique as the skin on your thumb.\nFrom the same test phone, all three games Lockdown tested sent ad network Chartboost nearly the same array of device-specific data points. (An ad network is a company that serves as a broker between publishers and advertisers.) All three also sent ultra-specific characteristics of the test iPhone to an ad company called Vungle. That could allow app-makers and advertisers to connect the dots and track you without your consent.\nData shared with Chartboost by \u2018Subway Surfers,\u2019 \u2018Streamer Life!\u2019 and \u2018Run Rich 3D\u2019\nDevice Name (e.g., \u201cJohn\u2019s iPhone X\u201d)\nAccessibility Setting: Bold Text\nAccessibility Setting: Custom Text Size\nDisplay Setting: Dark Mode\nScreen Resolution\nTime Zone\nTotal Storage Space (bytes precision)\nFree Storage Space (bytes precision)\nCurrency (e.g., \u201cUSD\")\niOS Version\nAudio Output (e.g., \u201cSpeakerphone\u201d/\"Bluetooth\")\nAudio Input (e.g., \u201ciPhone Microphone\u201d)\nAccessibility Setting: Closed Captioning\nCountry\nCellular Carrier Name (E.g., \u201cAT&T\")\nCellular Carrier Country\nLast Restart Time (Exact Timestamp, Second Precision)\nCalendar Type (E.g., \u201cGregorian\u201d)\nEnabled Keyboards (E.g., \u201cEnglish, Emoji, Arabic\u201d)\nCurrent Battery Level (15 decimals precision)\nCurrent Volume Level (3 decimals precision)\nAccessibility Setting: Increase Contrast\nCurrent Screen Brightness (15 decimals precision)\nPortrait/Landscape Mode\nBattery Charging State (E.g., \u201cPlugged In\u201d)\niPhone Model (E.g., \u201ciPhone X\")\nLanguage\nUser Agent (Browser Agent)\nIP address\nNeither Lockdown nor other privacy experts we consulted could say with certainty what was happening with the data flowing out of these apps, or whether it was being used to track people for advertising. Only the app makers themselves can explain what\u2019s happening with your data.\n\u201cThe list of readouts from Chartboost certainly looks like it could be used to create a fingerprint. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way to know without seeing what comes out the other side,\u201d said Bennett Cyphers, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a digital rights advocacy group.\nFew of the app developers would give us clear answers.\n\u201cIn order for the game to function properly, some data is communicated to Ad Networks,\u201d emailed Sybo, the company that makes \u201cSubway Surfers.\u201d \u201cAs a company, we do not track users for advertising purposes without their consent.\u201d It didn\u2019t specify why it needed to send so much personal information to ad companies to function properly.\nThe maker of \u201cRun Rich 3D\u201d did not respond to requests for comment. The maker of \u201cStreamer Life!\u201d said it was compliant with Apple\u2019s privacy rules.\nChartboost, an ad company owned by game maker Zynga, wouldn\u2019t answer our questions, but it said it is \u201ccommitted to protecting the privacy of the end users while providing the best experience possible for our publishers to support their revenue streams from advertising.\u201d\nVungle said the data points it received cannot be used \u201cto identify users or discern what other apps they may use.\u201d It said they \u201cserve the practical purpose of ensuring we show an ad compatible with the right device in the right language for the right country and app.\u201d It didn\u2019t explain how data such as battery level helps it do that.\nApple said fingerprinting iPhones has long been against its rules.\nWhat is tracking, anyway?\nIt\u2019s hard to forbid tracking when there\u2019s little agreement on what \u201ctracking\u201d even means.\nMany iPhone owners might assume it means an app taking your data in some way, perhaps including your location. Privacy advocates argue tracking can happen any time an app or website shares your personal information with a third party without your express consent. It\u2019s one more company that could leak or misuse your data. (One recent example is a Catholic priest who appears to have been outed as gay using data likely sent to a third party by the dating app Grindr.)\nApple applies a more narrow definition of tracking: the process of connecting information collected about you on one company\u2019s app or website with information collected by different companies \u2014 and only for the purposes of ad targeting, ad measurement or sale to data brokers. It excludes sharing data for other purposes, such as analytics and fighting fraud.\nAdvertisement\nSome in the app industry are promoting their own definitions of tracking while seeing how far they can bend the one provided by Apple.\nThat\u2019s because for apps that rely on ads, Apple\u2019s tracking protections were bad news. Advertisers don\u2019t want to pay if there isn\u2019t proof their ad prompted people to download another app or make a purchase.\nBefore Apple\u2019s crackdown, matching up customers with the ads they\u2019d tapped on was relatively easy. But with iOS 14.5 came a giant problem: The technology the industry had come to rely on for tracking \u2014 the IDFA number \u2014 suddenly disappeared.\nEnter fingerprinting. Some in the ad industry use different terms for it. For example, \u201cprobabilistic matching\u201d is a way to use personal information harvested from iPhones to attribute ads without knowing the user\u2019s identity for sure.\nFingerprinting uses innocent-looking but technical information about a device, like its volume, battery level and IP address, to identify it The practice has divided the app industry. \u201cWe are constantly getting pressure from customers who want to do probabilistic matching for opted out users,\u201d said Alex Austin, the CEO of app data company Branch. \u201cWe believe that ultimately Apple will take a stance here and crack down on companies that are attempting workarounds.\u201d Some data companies barely hide what they\u2019re up to. Lockdown found that two data companies \u2014 AppsFlyer and Kochava \u2014 built settings that let their clients ignore people\u2019s tracking preferences.\nKochava, a maker of ad performance software, offers a product named \u201cAppleTracker 4.6.1.\u201d Lockdown found that Kochava lets its customers simply toggle a switch to override people\u2019s tracking request. Kochava said the capability was designed so that companies could track customers across apps and websites they own themselves \u2014 which doesn\u2019t violate Apple\u2019s narrow tracking definition. But there\u2019s little stopping developers from using Kochava to track across apps made by different companies, too, which would violate even Apple\u2019s rules.\nLockdown found a similar end-run available from data company AppsFlyer. Lin called it a privacy cheat mode. \u201cAll it took was clicking a single button,\u201d he said.\nWho\u2019s responsible for how this technology gets used? Both companies have warnings on their websites telling app-makers not to abuse their capabilities with people who\u2019ve opted out of tracking \u2014 but they don\u2019t technically stop it.\nKochava said: \u201cThe guidelines have been authored by Apple and we would expect Apple to enforce them. Default behavior by Kochava is compliant with Apple policies.\u201d\nAppsFlyer said, \u201cThe app developers are in full control.\u201d\nWhat can be done\nProtecting privacy is an arms race.\nSome advocates say Apple\u2019s tracking crackdown has made a difference.\n\u201cApple moving from a stance of \u2018tracking is sanctioned by default\u2019 to \u2018tracking is only sanctioned when a user opts in\u2019 is a big, big deal,\u201d Cyphers said of the EFF.\nBut if you\u2019re a privacy-conscious iPhone owner, the rise of fingerprinting is bad news.\n\u201cPreviously consumers had some control over their data \u2014 for example, they could at least reset their IDFA and know that they would likely unlink their previous activities from whatever new actions they\u2019re engaging in,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, the former chief technologist for the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cWith fingerprinting, you have no idea whether or not a company is actually linking your activities \u2014 and you have no easy way to stop it if it occurs.\u201d\nThe open question is what Apple will do about it.\nAdvertisement\nMany app makers and data companies take cover behind Apple, saying if they were doing something wrong, Apple would stop them in the reviews it conducts before allowing them on the App Store.\nIn April, Apple appeared to make an example out of apps working with a data firm called Adjust, leading it to stop collecting certain data points. But since then, say industry executives, Apple\u2019s enforcement has dried up, and data companies are seeing how far they can push it.\n\u201cApple has not done anything to stop it, so every company moved into doing it,\u201d said Eric Seufert, the founder of a consultancy called Heracles who runs the influential industry blog Mobile Dev Memo.\nApple said it\u2019s the responsibility of apps themselves to follow its rules, but it has rejected tens of thousands for policy concerns related to App Tracking Transparency and fingerprinting.\nWithout thorough audits, it may be hard even for Apple to know exactly what happens to data after it leaves an app and goes to a third party. Some apps and data companies also take technical steps to hide their code, making it harder to investigate it.\nApps do have to say in privacy policies that they send data to third parties, but often don\u2019t specify to whom or exactly why. The privacy \u201cnutrition labels\u201d Apple started requiring apps to post to its App Store earlier this year also don\u2019t include the names of the companies receiving data.\nA new App Privacy Report feature in iOS 15 lets people see what domains are contacted by the apps they use \u2014 but you can\u2019t individually opt out of the connections. If you want to try to block trackers, software such as Lockdown, Jumbo Privacy or Disconnect\u2019s Privacy Pro tries to break the connections to companies in the business of tracking.\nThere\u2019s also some hope Apple might yet come up with technical solutions that make fingerprinting harder for apps to do on its devices. The new Private Relay service Apple is offering as a part of an iCloud Plus subscription could pave the way. It obscures IP addresses from Web trackers in the Safari browser, a data point that\u2019s often key to app fingerprinting, too.\nUnless Apple acts, the privacy of iPhone owners is in the hands of app developers and data companies. Given their history, trusting them with our personal information is a lot to ask.",

        "title": "Apple Loses Global Battery Chief, Poached by Volkswagen",
        "body": "Apple has lost its Global Battery Chief, Soonho Ahn, to German automaker Volkswagen, as first reported by Manager Magazin (via Tesla North).\nBack in early 2019, it was reported Ahn was scooped up by Apple, poaching the battery executive from Samsung. Ahn became Apple\u2019s new Global Head of Battery Developments.\nVolkswagen plans to build six battery plants to supply the company\u2019s electric vehicle ambitions, and Ahn appears to be a central part of the initiative, as he has relocated to Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, Germany, according to his updated LinkedIn profile. Previously he was working at Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, California.\nAhn earned his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Auburn University in Alabama, which is also Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s alma mater. Prior to working at Samsung, he was a longtime executive at LG Chem, as the South Korean company\u2019s VP of Energy Solutions.\nThe loss of Ahn could be seen as a blow to Apple\u2019s \u201cProject Titan\u201d self-driving electric vehicle project. Batteries are the integral heart of an electric car and Ahn\u2019s departure also joins the recent loss of \u201cProject Titan\u201d chief Doug Ford, who departed for Ford back in September.\nApple\u2019s car project is now being led by executive Kevin Lynch, who previously headed up Apple Watch software. A recent Bloomberg report said Apple was fast-tracking its car project, with an internal timeline now noting four years, which could mean a car debuting as soon as 2025 (no word if the Apple car will charge with Lightning or USB-C, however).",

        "title": "Apple will soon let you pass on your iCloud data when you die",
        "body": "Apple is solving a complicated problem with its latest iOS update: right of survivorship. Until now, when a loved one or family member dies, there was no easy way to access their iCloud account and absolutely no way of unlocking their phone without knowing their passcode. According to the iCloud terms of service, the deceased person\u2019s data goes with them even with a death certificate.\nWith the new Digital Legacy program, first announced at WWDC earlier this year and arriving in iOS 15.2, you can designate up to five people as Legacy Contacts. These individuals can then access your data and personal information stored in iCloud when you die, such as photos, documents, and even purchases.\nTo activate Digital Legacy, Apple still requires proof of death and an access key. Still, it\u2019s a much more simplified process than before, which could require a court order confirming a right to inheritance, and even then, there was no guarantee you would get access to the data.\nThis has been a complicated situation for Apple, which has long touted its core principles of protecting users\u2019 privacy. Grieving parents and spouses railing against the company for not giving them access to their spouses\u2019 photos isn\u2019t a good look. But neither is doling out people\u2019s data willy-nilly.\nBoth Google and Facebook have systems in place for designating account access to other people, and it\u2019s good to see Apple catching up here.\nYou can set up your Legacy Contacts in Settings on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer Image: Apple\nHow to set up a Legacy Contact\n(note you need to be running iOS 15.2 to access this feature)\nOn an iOS device, go to Settings > [your name] > Password & Security.\nOn a Mac, go to System Preferences > Apple ID > Password & Security.\nUnder Legacy Contact, follow the instructions to add a Legacy Contact. If you use Family Sharing, you can choose a family member from the list; alternatively, add someone using their email or phone number.\nNotify your Legacy Contact and share an access key via Messages. If they accept, a copy of the access key is automatically stored in their Apple ID settings. If they decline, you will receive a notification. The access key is required to get into your account if you pass away.\nWhile you can add a Legacy Contact who isn\u2019t on iOS 15.2, they won\u2019t be able to store the access key in the settings on their device, so you should provide it to them in another way.",

        "title": "Apple tells workers they have right to discuss wages, working conditions",
        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Apple delivered a message to employees on Friday that was striking given its reputation for secrecy: a reminder that workers may discuss wages, hours and working conditions.\nThe notice came as some employees have been pushing Apple to do more to ensure there are no unfair gaps in pay across the company.\nIn a post on an internal site, Apple said its policies do not preclude employees from \"speaking freely\" about working conditions, according to a copy of the message viewed by Reuters.\n\"We encourage any employee with concerns to raise them in the way they feel most comfortable, internally or externally,\" the post states.\nA spokesperson for Apple declined to comment.\nApple's business conduct policy already included language stating that workers were not restricted in their ability to discuss wages, hours and working conditions, which is generally protected under U.S. law.\nBut employees who have spoken out in recent months have faced resistance, said former Apple program manager Janneke Parrish.\nParrish, who was fired after playing a leading role in employee activism, said she is hopeful that Apple's message will ease the path for others.\n\"The first step is making sure people are aware of their rights,\" she said.\nApple has previously said it does not discuss specific employee matters and is \"deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace.\"\nThe move comes amid a broader push by Silicon Valley workers to speak out about their working conditions and the impact of technology on society.\nEarlier this week, another prominent activist, Apple software engineer Cher Scarlett, wrote on Twitter that she is leaving the company.\nScarlett filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that Apple halted discussions of pay among employees. Her lawyer, Aleksandr Felstiner, said the matter had been settled and the charge would be withdrawn. Scarlett said she could not comment.\nScarlett and Parrish worked together on \"#AppleToo,\" a group through which current and former employees have been sharing stories of what they call harassment and discrimination.\nApple is known for its secretive culture, intended to keep details of new products under wraps. Employees sometimes are unaware of their right to speak about topics such as pay and working conditions, Parrish said.\nAshley Gjovik, a senior engineering program manager who was fired by Apple in September after raising concerns about harassment and workplace safety, has filed NLRB charges in which she alleges that Apple policies violate the National Labor Relations Act.\nReporting by Julia Love; Editing by Daniel Wallis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
