        "title": "USB-C iPhone could become mandatory in the US as senators push for common charger law",
        "body": "Just last week, the European Union officially reached an agreement on making the USB-C charging port the mandatory standard starting in 2024. Now, a group of senators in the United States is looking to follow suit, calling on the US Commerce Department to adopt a similar policy to address the \u201clack of interoperability standards for charging and other device accessories.\u201d\nUSB-C charging requirement in the United States?\nThe letter was sent to Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce for the United States, and it\u2019s signed by senators Ed Markey, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders. In the letter, the three explain that the lack of an interoperability standard in the United States results in e-waste and environmental damage, while also being a burden on consumers (via The Verge).\n\u201cWe urge you to follow the EU\u2019s lead by developing a comprehensive strategy to address unnecessary consumer costs, mitigate e-waste, and restore sanity and certainty to the process of purchasing new electronics,\u201d the letter explains.\nAccording to the senators, proprietary charging standards such as Apple\u2019s Lightning port are an example of \u201cplanned obsolescence\u201d that is \u201cexpensive and frustrating for consumers, and drives the proliferation of electronic waste.\u201d\nAs for how to tackle this problem, the senators write that the United States should look no further than the EU. The new common charger law in the EU is an example of \u201ctaking on powerful technology companies\u201d to reduce e-waste and \u201chelp consumers who are tired of having to rummage through junk drawers full of tangled chargers to find a compatible one, or buy a new one.\u201d\nThe letter concludes by urging the secretary of commerce to address the lack of a common US charging standard to solve these issues:\nWe urge you to coordinate with offices and agencies across the Department of Commerce to develop a comprehensive plan that will protect both consumers and the environment by addressing the lack of a common U.S. charging standard. We cannot allow the consumer electronics industry to prioritize proprietary and inevitably obsolete charging technology over consumer protection and environmental health.\nApple\u2019s response: USB-C iPhone in 2023?\nIt\u2019s important to remember that it took years and years for the EU to finally pass its own common charging port agreement. In fact, when the efforts first started to gain traction, the plan was to standardize on microUSB as the common charging port standard.\nApple has regularly pushed back on the EU\u2019s common charger narrative, saying that such a requirement would actually lead to more e-waste being generated and stifle innovation.\nRegardless of how it feels about the EU legislation, reports indicate that Apple is planning to switch to USB-C charging for the iPhone 15 in 2023. The company\u2019s end goal, however, is to make the iPhone completely port-less.",

        "body": "Apple today announced its next-generation MacBook Air, starting at $1199, featuring the just-announced M2 chip inside. The new MacBook Air has a redesigned enclosure and comes in striking new case colors.\nThe new Air design comes in silver, space gray, starlight, midnight, and gold. The previous teardrop wedge shape has been replaced with a simpler, flat-edged chassis.

Apple states that the new MacBook Air gets about 18 hours of continuous video playback on battery.\nThe overall display size for MacBook Air is increased to 13.6-inches, thanks to the slimmer bezels. The notch houses a new 1080p webcam.\nThe M2 chip is up to five times faster than the last-generation Intel MacBook Airs, and up to 40% faster than the 2020 M1 Air.\nIt also comes with a brand new dual USB-C port power charger. MacBook Air can fast charge to 50% battery in 30 minutes.\nThe new MacBook Air is a massive upgrade in all aspects \u2014 apart from price. The new Air starts at $1199, a couple hundred dollars jump over the previous-generation $999 Air. Also today, Apple simultaneously updated the 13-inch MacBook Pro with an M2 chip, priced at $1299. They will be available in July.",

There are some limits to be aware of \u2026\nThe ability to edit and undo sent messages has been a long time coming, and brings iMessage up to speed with other group chat apps like WhatsApp. It also means that Apple beat Twitter to the edit button.\nYou can now edit iMessages\niMessages that are edited after the fact are denoted by an \u2018Edited\u2019 subtitle next to their delivery status, so the recipient knows the message has been changed. A message can be recalled or edited for up to fifteen minutes are it has been sent.\niMessage is also integrating SharePlay directly, so you don\u2019t need to launch a FaceTime call to share an activity like watching a movie together.\nApple is also updating its Dictation features to help compose messages with your voice. You can now dictate and edit text with your finger simultaneously, useful for quick corrections.\nThese new iMessage features will arrive as part of iOS 16 this fall. Presumably, all participants in the iMessage thread will need to be running iOS 16 in order to take advantages of the new features.\nApple announced iOS 16 as part of WWDC keynote event, taking place right now. iOS 16 release date for everyone will be sometime this fall.

        "title": "AirTag helps man discover lost luggage graveyard in airline offices",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nAfter an airline failed to find his lost luggage, a YouTuber used his AirTags to go straight to it in an airport office filled with unclaimed bags.\nApple's AirTags have helped with lost luggage before, and there are plenty of luggage tags now designed to hold them. But for Australian YouTuber Shane Miller, an AirTag not only found his missing bags, it did so despite the airport's baggage carrier, Swissport.\nMiller says that the luggage, containing $4,500 worth of cycling equipment, went missing after he flew in to Melbourne Airport on Singapore Airlines. Officials told him his luggage hadn't made the connecting flight, and he would be contacted as soon as it arrived.\nOnce the bags had arrived at the airport, Miller's AirTags reported their location to him and he expected to hear from the officials. However, Swissport failed to contact him \u2014 and he was unable to reach anyone despite many phone calls.\n\"My beef with Singapore Airlines and their ground handling service Swissport is that there's been no interaction,\" said Miller. \"The number I was provided for Swissport the night I landed I've called 16 times and received no callbacks whatsoever.\"\n\"It goes to voicemail and somebody is checking those because the box is emptied every few days,\" he continued.\nMore, Swissport has a website that lists lost luggage \u2014 and it was not updated to include his.\nAfter a week of waiting, Miller drove to the airport and used Find My to take him through to the back offices of Swissport. He found his bag, but it wasn't in some lost property room, it had been slung in the corner of a general office.\n\"Long story short, the guy at oversized baggage really, really helped out on where I needed to go to get the bag,\" says Miller. \"Then the last mile, so to speak, was all 100% the AirTag.\"\n\"The office staff were very helpful, taking me to the correct office,\" he continued. \"And I was able to tell I was within a few meters of the bag, and when I was around the corner from where the bag was dumped on one of their office floors, I could make it start beeping.\"\n\"So that's my story almost concluded,\" he said, \"but the amount of bags they had on the floor... I am lucky that I got my bag back so easily.\"\nMiller is an IT professional, as well as a cyclist, who reviews cycling accessories such as GPS navigation and trackers. He's previously described the AirTags as \"the best bicycle tracker,\" and featured them on his YouTube channel.\nDespite his knowledge of AirTags, it still took Miller a week and, as he says trying \"every avenue,\" to get his bags. Without an AirTag in his equipment luggage, he suspects he may never have got them back.\nThat is of course exactly what AirTags are intended for, and his isn't the only story of them helping air travellers.\nThe success of AirTags, though, has led to controversy. Perhaps because Apple, unlike rivals in this field, has been outspoken about anti-stalking features, the effect has been to shine a spotlight on the issues.",

When enabled, Apple says iCloud will automatically and privately verify your device and Apple ID account in the background, eliminating the need for apps and websites to present you with a CAPTCHA verification prompt.\nApple recently shared a video with technical details about how the feature works, but simply put, Apple's system verifies that the device and Apple ID account are in good standing and presents what is called a Private Access Token to the app or website. This new system will offer a better user experience for tasks such as signing into or creating an account, with improved user privacy and accessibility compared to CAPTCHAs.\n\"Private Access Tokens are a powerful alternative that help you identify HTTP requests from legitimate devices and people without compromising their identity or personal information,\" said Apple, in the description of a WWDC 2022 video related to the topic.\nCloudflare and Fastly have already announced support for Private Access Tokens, meaning that the ability to bypass CAPTCHAs could be coming to millions of apps and websites powered by those platforms, and the feature will roll out more widely over time.\nIn the first betas of iOS 16 and iPadOS 16, Automatic Verification is enabled by default. Apple said the feature is also supported on macOS Ventura. All of the software updates are currently in beta and will be released later this year.",

        "title": "Cloud gaming ban on the App Store, and mandatory WebKit usage, both declared anticompetitive",
        "body": "Apple\u2019s ban on cloud gaming services in the App Store, and its insistence that all iOS browser apps must use its own WebKit browser engine, have both been declared to be anticompetitive by the UK competition watchdog.\nThe announcement follows a year-long investigation \u2026\nBackground\nApple faces an avalanche of antitrust investigations and lawsuits around the world, with the App Store getting the greatest attention.\nOne of the restrictions placed on App Store gaming apps is a ban on cloud gaming apps. This means that a developer cannot offer an app that provides access to multiple games played via cloud servers. It\u2019s suggested that the company\u2019s aim here is to protect its own share of per-game revenue, and to block competition to its own Apple Arcade subscription gaming service.\nAdditionally, while Apple allows any developer to create its own web browser, and offer it through the App Store, the Cupertino company only approves browsers which use its own WebKit rendering engine. This makes it impossible for a developer to, for example, make a browser app that is faster than Safari \u2013 and Apple also blocks access to some Safari features, like Apple Pay integration.\nCloud gaming ban anticompetitive\nThe UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) carried out an investigation into various antitrust complaints against both Apple and Google, and has today announced its findings. It says both companies restrict competition.\nThe study found that Apple and Google have an effective duopoly on mobile ecosystems that allows them to exercise a stranglehold over these markets, which include operating systems, app stores and web browsers on mobile devices. Without interventions, both companies are likely to maintain, and even strengthen, their grip over the sector, further restricting competition and limiting incentives for innovators.\nThe CMA concluded that Apple\u2019s exclusion of cloud gaming services harms both developers and consumers.\nApple has blocked the emergence of cloud gaming services on its App Store. Like web apps, cloud gaming services are a developing innovation, providing mobile access to high-quality games that can be streamed rather than individually downloaded. Gaming apps are a key source of revenue for Apple and cloud gaming could pose a real threat to Apple\u2019s strong position in app distribution. By preventing this sector from growing, Apple risks causing mobile users to miss out on the full benefits of cloud gaming.\nMandatory use of WebKit limits competition\nThe CMA also concluded that Apple\u2019s insistence that all iOS browsing apps use WebKit \u2013 with both speed and functionality limited by the capabilities of this engine \u2013 similarly blocks competition.\nApple bans alternatives to its own browser engine on its mobile devices; a restriction that is unique to Apple. The CMA is concerned this severely limits the potential for rival browsers to differentiate themselves from Safari (for example, on features such as speed and functionality) and limits Apple\u2019s incentives to invest in its browser engine. This restriction also seriously inhibits the capability of web apps \u2013 apps that run on a browser rather than having to be individually downloaded \u2013 depriving consumers and businesses of the full benefits of this innovative technology.\nThis complaint was voiced earlier this year by a group of developers under the Open Web Advocacy banner.\nInvestigation into App Store terms continues\nA broader investigation into the terms and conditions Apple imposes on developers is also underway, but has not yet released its findings.\nSeparately, the CMA has an existing competition law investigation underway in relation to Apple\u2019s App Store terms and conditions, which it opened in March 2021.\nA similar investigation has been launched into Google\u2019s terms of in-app payments in the Play Store.",

Read our ethics policy\nCredit: Kon Karampelas/Unsplash\nAn FCC commissioner has called on Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, likening the popular social media platform to a wolf in sheep's clothing.\nBrendan Carr, the ranking Republican FCC commissioner, on Tuesday penned a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. In the open letter, he urged the companies ban TikTok from their respective app marketplaces because it \"harvests swaths of sensitive data\" from U.S. users.\nTikTok is not just another video app.\nThat's the sheep's clothing.\nIt harvests swaths of sensitive data that new reports show are being accessed in Beijing.\nI've called on @Apple & @Google to remove TikTok from their app stores for its pattern of surreptitious data practices. pic.twitter.com/Le01fBpNjn \u2014 Brendan Carr (@BrendanCarrFCC) June 28, 2022\nCarr's letter makes heavy references to a recent BuzzFeed report indicating that TikTok staff in China allegedly had sweeping access to the data of users in the U.S. The report, gathered from statements by nine separate TikTok employees, revealed that Chinese engineers had access to non-public U.S. user data.\nIn a tweet on Tuesday, Carr said that the app's video features are just its \"sheep's clothing.\" Apparently citing the June report, the commissioner wrote that TikTok collects \"everything from search and browsing histories to keystroke patterns and biometric identifiers, including faceprintsand voiceprints.\"\n\"It is clear that TikTok poses an unacceptable national security risk due to its extensive data harvesting being combined with Beijing's apparently unchecked access to that sensitive data,\" Carr wrote. \"Therefore, I am requesting that you apply the plain text of your app store policies to TikTok and remove it from your app stores for failure to abide by those terms.\"\nThe BuzzFeed report makes reference to leaked audio from a September 2021 meeting in which a TikTok employee said an unnamed ByteDance engineer in China had \"access to everything.\" ByteDance is the Chinese-based parent company of TikTok.\nHours before the report was published, TikTok announced that it had migrated its U.S. user data to domestic servers run by Oracle.\nReportedly, Chinese employees were capable of accessing U.S. user data from at least September 2021 to January 2022.\nThis is not the first time that TikTok has been in hot water in the U.S. Back in 2020, then-President Donald Trump signed an executive order demanding that ByteDance divest from TikTok under threat of a ban in the U.S. At the time, the White House cited national security concerns.",

To transfer an eSIM from another iPhone, Apple says to make sure the other iPhone is nearby, unlocked, has Bluetooth turned on, and is running iOS 16 or later.\nThe feature appears to be available in multiple countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, but it is only possible to complete Bluetooth transfers of eSIMs issued by carriers that support the feature. Given that iOS 16 was only announced a few days ago and is currently in beta, carrier support may be limited right now.\nApple also continues to provide the more traditional option of setting up an eSIM by scanning a QR code provided by a carrier.\nAn eSIM is a digital SIM that allows you to activate a cellular plan from a carrier without having to use a physical nano-SIM card. A single eSIM is available on the iPhone XS and newer, while all four iPhone 13 models support dual eSIMs.\nThe first beta of iOS 16 was seeded to developers earlier this week, and a public beta will be available in July. Apple said iOS 16 will be released in the fall, at which point this new eSIM transfer feature will be available to all users.\n(Thanks, Carson!)",

        "title": "iPad Air 5 base model lacks memory swap despite being a requirement for Stage Manager",
        "body": "With iPadOS 16, Apple announced multiple new features that are exclusive to iPads based on the M1 chip, such as Stage Manager for running apps in windows and also virtual memory swap for the first time on an iOS device. Interestingly, while memory swapping is reportedly one of the requirements to have Stage Manager, it turns out that the base model iPad Air 5 lacks this capability.\nFor those unfamiliar, virtual memory swap is a feature often used by computers to reallocate some storage as virtual RAM when the computer\u2019s actual RAM is already being fully utilized by the system and apps. Even Macs do memory swapping, and now this feature will be available on iPads for the first time with iPadOS 16.\nAccording to Apple, iPadOS 16 allows the most demanding apps to use up to 16GB of storage as temporary RAM. And of course, amid the controversy of limiting the Stage Manager feature to iPad models with the M1 chip, Apple claims that running iPad apps in windows requires super-fast virtual memory swap, which is theoretically only possible with the M1 chip.\nBut here\u2019s the thing. As noted by developer Steve Troughton-Smith on Twitter, the base model of the iPad Air 5 is not compatible with virtual memory swap. That\u2019s probably because the 64GB of internal storage is not enough for memory swapping. As Apple quietly suggests on its website, memory swapping on the iPad requires at least 128GB of storage in addition to M1.\nThis is totally understandable, but then comes the question: Why does Apple keep saying that virtual memory swap is a requirement for Stage Manager when the 64GB iPad Air 5, which supports Stage Manager, clearly has no virtual memory swap?\nStage Manager controversy\nSince the announcement of iPadOS 16 at WWDC 2022, multiple users have been criticizing Apple\u2019s decision to limit Stage Manager to iPads with the M1 chip. Apple\u2019s PR team quickly got company executives out in public to talk about how the feature demands advanced hardware, but some previous generation iPad Pro owners remain skeptical about these requirements.\nStage Manager lets users run up to eight apps simultaneously on the iPad. In addition, it enables support for one external display that can also be used to interact with multiple apps in windows.\nThe M1 chip requirement for Stage Manager is somewhat understandable. M1 iPads have at least 8GB of RAM and they\u2019re certainly more powerful than other iPads, but it seems that Apple could\u2019ve made the effort to bring Stage Manager to other iPads in a certain way and it chose not to.\nHere\u2019s what Apple\u2019s head of software engineering Craig Federighi said in a recent interview:\nIt\u2019s only the M1 iPads that combined the high DRAM capacity with very high capacity, high performance NAND that allows our virtual memory swap to be super fast.\nFederighi emphasizes that Stage Manager was only made possible because of virtual memory swap, which is unavailable on the base model of the iPad Air 5. He also claimed that M1 is responsible for the animations and shadows when using Stage Manager. Meanwhile, Intel Macs that are less powerful than an iPad will get Stage Manager with macOS Ventura \u2013 does Apple know how bad Intel GPUs are for rendering animations?\n9to5Mac\u2019s Take\nAs pointed out by my 9to5Mac colleague Ben Lovejoy, Apple could\u2019ve brought Stage Manager with some limitations to older iPad Pro models, or even to the 4th-generation iPad Air.\nWorking with a windowed interface is not only about the amount of apps you can open simultaneously. Personally, I rarely open more than four apps at the same time on my Mac, but I still like being able to organize them the way I want. Some with larger windows, some with smaller ones.\nIf you think about the current state of multitasking in iPadOS 15, every iPad model can already run up to three apps simultaneously without performance issues. You can have two apps running side by side with Split View and an extra app running with Slide Over \u2013 not to mention Picture-in-Picture and Quick Note.\nI\u2019m quite sure that A12X and A12Z iPad Pro and owners, who surely bought these iPads with the promise that \u201ctheir next computers wouldn\u2019t be computers,\u201d would be more than happy to have Stage Manager with a limit of three to four apps instead of eight. iPads can already do this without a lot of RAM, memory swap, or the powerful M1 chip for rendering animations and shadows.\nBut what do you think? Could Apple have optimized Stage Manager to work with non-M1 iPads? Let me know in the comments below.",

        "body": "Today marks the 10th anniversary of Apple announcing the first MacBook Pro model featuring a higher-resolution Retina display.\nIntroduced at WWDC 2012, the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro introduced a much thinner design compared to the previous model, as Apple removed the built-in Ethernet port, FireWire port, and CD/DVD drive. The notebook was still equipped with two Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, MagSafe 2, and a headphone jack.\n\"The MacBook Pro with Retina display pushes the limits of performance and portability like no other notebook,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a press release announcing the new MacBook Pro. \"With a gorgeous Retina display, all flash architecture and a radically thin and light design, the new MacBook Pro is the most advanced Mac we have ever built.\"\nAt the time it launched, Apple said the Retina MacBook Pro featured the world's highest resolution notebook display, with 220 pixels per inch. The notebook was powered by Intel's third-generation quad-core Core i7 processors, and equipped with NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M graphics, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to a 768GB SSD.\nPricing for the first Retina MacBook Pro started at $2,199 in the United States. In October 2012, Apple announced a 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display, which started at a lower price of $1,699. Both notebooks are now on Apple's obsolete products list.",

        "title": "watchOS 9 is Apple Watch's greatest update in years thanks to Series 3 being discontinued",
        "body": "Apple previewed watchOS 9 during the WWDC 2022 keynote. For the first time, not only is the company bringing a ton of features to the Apple Watch, but it seems Apple finally learned how to let go of the Apple Watch Series 3, as the five-years-old wearable won\u2019t support this upcoming operating system.\nIt\u2019s been at least a year since 9to5Mac reported why Apple should stop selling Apple Watch Series 3. With a small screen, fewer sensors, an old processor, and inside storage limitations, the Series 3 owners have been struggling for years, especially when trying to update the Watch to a new version of the operating system.\nAs it does with the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, Apple decided it was going to keep supporting Apple Watch Series 3 but limiting the number of features available. Now, finally, the company stated that watchOS 9 won\u2019t be available for this model.\nWeirdly enough, although the Apple Watch Series 3 won\u2019t get watchOS 9, Apple is still selling it from its online store by only stating it won\u2019t support the latest software update. As it seems, Apple wants to profit the most it can from this product before discontinuing it later this fall when the company is rumored to announce not only the Apple Watch Series 8 but also a second-generation Apple Watch SE and an extreme sports Apple Watch.\nWhy the end of the Apple Watch Series 3 means watchOS 9 can finally shine\nWith the Apple Watch Series 3 losing support to watchOS 9, Apple can finally ditch smaller screens. As you can see with the Watch Faces, Apple revamped a lot of older ones so they now look better on the new 41mm and 45mm displays as well as bringing more complexity to them, thanks to newer processors.\nIf you have an Apple Watch Series 7 and try some of the old Watch Faces on watchOS 8, you\u2019ll see how off they seem without them being perfectly optimized. With Series 3 gone, Apple fixed that. In addition, Apple even revamped the notification system, which is now closer to the one available on the iPhone.\nFor me, it feels like watchOS 9 is tying up loose ends. For example, watchOS 8 introduced the Sleep app, but it only provided a few tidbits on your sleep schedule. Now, Apple is preparing a proper app with information that you want to know about the period you\u2019re resting. Previously, the Health app brought lots of new functions, such as Cycle Tracking \u2013 now, watchOS 9 brings a Medications app that helps you track all the pills and vitamins you take every day.\nwatchOS 9 also offers deeper Focus Mode integration, more languages available with the QWERTY keyboard, and even QuickType, which brings word prediction to the Apple Watch for the first time.\nFocusing on a larger display also makes the Apple Watch way more useful with watchOS 9. Apple revamped the Workouts app. For runners like me, there\u2019s a new Workout Views where I just need to turn the Digital Crown in order to see lots of metrics, which are available during my run:\nActivity rings\nHeart Rate Zones\nPower\nElevation\nEven for other exercises, watchOS 9 will also display at least the calories burned plus the Activity Ring.\nIn addition, watchOS 9 lets me customize my workout by tailoring work and recovery intervals to suit my training style. I can receive alerts for pace, heart rate, cadence, and power. With instant feedback, I know if I\u2019m on pace to meet my goal. Thanks to dynamic pacing, it helps me know whether I need to push a bit more. Also, for the first time, watchOS 9 supports multisport workouts.\nWrap up\nI honestly think watchOS 9 is the greatest update for the Apple Watch in years, and the main reason is Apple Watch Series 3 going away for good. I know it\u2019s a very affordable wearable for those who just want an Apple device to track their daily activities, but with new Watches coming soon and so many new technologies available, Apple is making the right move to support watchOS 9 only to newer Watches.\nWhat are your thoughts on watchOS 9 and Apple not supporting Apple Watch Series 3 anymore?

        "title": "Apple and MLS to present all MLS matches for 10 years, beginning in 2023",
        "body": "Cupertino, California Apple and Major League Soccer (MLS) today announced that the Apple TV app will be the exclusive destination to watch every single live MLS match beginning in 2023. This partnership is a historic first for a major professional sports league, and will allow fans around the world to watch all MLS, Leagues Cup,1 and select MLS NEXT Pro and MLS NEXT matches in one place \u2014 without any local broadcast blackouts or the need for a traditional pay TV bundle.\nFrom early 2023 through 2032, fans can get every live MLS match by subscribing to a new MLS streaming service, available exclusively through the Apple TV app. In addition to all of the match content, the service will provide fans a new weekly live match whip-around show so they never miss an exciting goal or save, and also game replays, highlights, analysis, and other original programming.

        "title": "New iOS 16 CarPlay feature could let you pay for fuel from your car's screen",
        "body": "At WWDC, much of the attention was on the fancy next-generation CarPlay Apple previewed, but those experiences won\u2019t appear in cars for several years.\nNear term, something new for CarPlay in iOS 16 is the addition of new supported app categories for \u201cfuel and driving tasks,\u201d according to the iOS 16 feature preview page. A report from Reuters today says that some gas station chains are already preparing to take advantage of this and allow drivers to pay for fuel through the car\u2019s infotainment center.\nThese new CarPlay apps will let developers make apps that help users fuel up from their car, access toll road information, and get towing assistance from the CarPlay-enabled display.\nReuters spoke to gas station chain HF Sinclair about the new feature, which runs about 1,600 gas stations in the US. Sinclar said it plans to use the technology and is excited that \u201cconsumers could navigate to a Sinclair station and purchase fuel from their vehicle navigation screen.\u201d\nReuters also quotes Donald Frieden from P97 Networks, which manages the infrastructure behind digital fuel payments. Frieden says he has spoken to oil companies that want to make their apps work with CarPlay, although no brand is named explicitly.\nFrom Apple\u2019s developer guidance for developers, driving task apps should help enable tasks that people need to do while driving that are unrelated to navigation (e.g., a feature to find nearby shops is not allowed, as customers are expected to use the Maps app for that purpose). An example of a potential driving task app is a tool to help log mileage for business trip expenses.\nFueling apps must enable \u201cmeaningful functionality\u201d relevant to driving and cannot merely be a list of nearby fueling stations.\nThe new driving task and fueling CarPlay app templates join previously supported activities such as audio, messaging, EV charging, parking, and quick food ordering.\niOS 16 is currently in developer beta and will be available for everyone this fall. It\u2019s unclear how long after that customers will have to wait for a gas station chain to release a CarPlay-compatible fueling app.",

        "title": "Apple's native apps need to finally break free from iOS updates",
        "body": "At the moment, updating your iPhone or iPad is like buying a newspaper. It\u2019s a package deal: you either take it all or walk away with nothing. You can\u2019t go to a newsstand and only pay for the individual articles you want.\nOK, maybe that\u2019s an antiquated analogy, but that\u2019s kind of the point. Apple\u2019s iOS updates are a sprawling mixture of system changes, top-level interface tweaks, and updates to specific preinstalled apps, and it\u2019s inevitable that some elements will be more important or relevant to a given user than others. Individual app updates in particular are perfectly suited to a pick-and-mix approach, but that\u2019s not how it works. If you want the Mail update, for example, you have to download iOS 16.\nTake the changes to Messages that are coming in iOS 16. A pair of long-awaited new features will let users unsend a message after it\u2019s been sent or edit it to correct a typo. But beta testers quickly spotted that the feature doesn\u2019t work if the recipient isn\u2019t also running iOS 16. If the sender is using the first beta, the edit function doesn\u2019t do anything; with the second, it sends the edited version as a new message and does nothing to the original. It may change again in future betas, but the message is clear: Get iOS 16.\niPhone users are generally dutiful about installing updates on a timely basis, and come the fall there will be a large base of iOS 16 devices. But not every iPhone can run iOS 16; in fact, all of this year\u2019s Apple OS updates have been uncharacteristically ruthless in dropping support for older hardware. If your friend owns an iPhone 7, he or she is doomed to miss out on Messages\u2019 new features, and for the time being, that means you\u2019ll miss out on the full experience too.\nHardware compatibility is a complex topic, and I can\u2019t say for sure whether iMessage editing is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for the iPhone 7. But I doubt it. Compatibility depends on your hardware being capable of running all (or nearly all) of the individual components of an update, which means numerous devices will miss out on the package because one part is too demanding for their iPhones even though another would have been fine. To return to our original analogy, it\u2019s like putting a minimum reading age on a newspaper because it may contain graphic war photography and then refusing to sell the comics separately.\nThis is a very blunt-force approach to a complex situation.\nIDG\nGive piecemeal a chance\nApple already makes some exceptions to the package approach. Security updates, for example, are considered too important to be kept from older devices, and we periodically report that Apple has released a patch for a previous version of macOS or iOS. The company recognizes that setting a blanket hardware compatibility requirement isn\u2019t fair or efficient for security\u2014but there are many more cases where a piecemeal approach would help.\nAside from giving older devices access to individual features or tweaks they\u2019d otherwise miss out on, updating apps individually would make the whole process much more agile. At the moment, nearly all major (preinstalled) iPhone app updates are tied to iOS\u2019s fixed calendar, with the announcement at WWDC in the summer and the rollout in September. But it\u2019s hard to believe that every new feature follows that exact pattern in terms of conception and planning, and one would assume that plenty of new features have sat in Craig Federighi\u2019s inbox for months, waiting for WWDC before they\u2019re \u201callowed\u201d to be revealed.\nCut individual apps from the iOS apron strings and they can push updates as and when it suits them. Users get new features on a timely basis, Apple gets to take one more advantage away from Android, and changes to individual apps get the attention they deserve instead of being buried or completely ignored amid the excitement of 50 other announcements. Apple already does this with apps like Pages and iMovie, and it\u2019s time it came to the rest of iOS\u2019s native apps too.\nYou\u2019ll need to get iOS 16 to get the new Messages features. Apple\nHidden complexity\nPutting to one side the cynical rationale that older devices missing out on fun features is good for encouraging new purchases, the only good-faith counterargument I can think of is that updating multiple individual apps is more of a hassle, and harder to remember to do, than just updating iOS and getting all the good stuff as a bundle. I can see the attraction of making the experience as simple as possible, and it\u2019s a very Apple approach to hide the complexity under the hood and assure the user that everything is taken care of.\nBut there\u2019s a simple way to approach the piecemeal strategy too, and that\u2019s to encourage users to set app updates as automatic. That\u2019s the method I use, and this would mean you\u2019d get all the updates your device is capable of supporting without having to worry about the individual details.\nAfter 16 versions of iOS, it\u2019s time. Separating app updates from the main system is frictionless, but it\u2019s also reactive to context. It would be like pouring liquid concrete into a pothole instead of filling it with giant rocks. Or tearing the stories you like out of a newspaper and refusing to pay for the rest. And who hasn\u2019t wanted to do that?",

        "title": "A woman tracked her boyfriend with an AirTag and then killed him",
        "body": "It's been a little over a year since Apple announced AirTags. What started as an innocent way to keep track of your things, has grown to something more malicious over the past year, with stories of folks using the device in nefarious ways. Of course, this was bound to happen. But it looks like things have taken a turn for the worst, as Apple's AirTag has contributed to someone's death.\nAccording to USA Today, a woman in the United States, living in Indiana, tracked her boyfriend using an Apple AirTag and killed him over a suspected affair. The incident occurred at the top of the month, but is only now coming to light by way of a probable cause affidavit that was obtained by the source. The woman shared that she had used an AirTag to follow her boyfriend, which eventually led her to a bar, where her boyfriend was meeting another woman. The two got into an argument, with things escalating quickly. Soon after, they were asked to leave by the bartender.\nIt was at this point that the woman got into her car and hit her boyfriend. She then proceeded to run him over, going back and then forward. The woman also attempted to chase down the other woman, but the police arrived and detained the assailant. Unfortunately, the boyfriend was pronounced dead at the scene and the girlfriend was later charged with murder. While this is an extremely isolated incident, there have been numerous reports over the months about people using Apple's AirTags in unintended ways.\nThis has become such a problem that Apple has introduced ways to curb the issue. The company has released an app on the Google Play Store so that Android users can track unwanted AirTags. The firm has also added anti-tracking measures with iOS updates. Some states are even taking things into their own hands, creating bills that could make tracking with AirTags illegal. It just goes to show that while AirTags can be a life saver, they can also be deadly.\nSource: USA Today",

        "body": "Apple has revealed the changes iOS 16 will make to notifications, its most significant update to the area since iOS 12 was released in 2018. That update allowed automatic grouping of app notifications, but now, with iOS 16, it\u2019s getting even more organized.\nThere\u2019s a completely redesigned lock screen, customizable with widgets that look just like Apple Watch complications. Notifications in the lock screen now roll in from the bottom and can be hidden on the bottom of the lock screen.\nNotifications in iOS 16 appear on bottom of the lock screen in a new stacked view. Image: Apple\nThe newest feature is called Live Activities. It can pin notifications that act like widgets, such as live sports scores from the Apple TV app that remain on the lock screen. Live Activities comes with a new API for developers to take advantage of and make new persistent experiences.\nNotifications use bolder text and can include images as well for better visibility. You can now choose between three views for your notifications on the lock screen, including the new Stacked view that keeps the notifications at the bottom and out of the way. There\u2019s also the Count view, which hides the notifications away, and finally the expanded list view that\u2019ll use the full vertical space of the screen. The views can be toggled by pinching the notifications to expand or contract.\niPhone notifications have been, historically, a terribly managed system. With the new changes, Apple is finally catching up to Android in having a versatile way of managing notifications.",

        "body": "Polish developer Micha\u0142 Gapi\u0144ski has released a new and improved version of his \"Tesla Android Project\" which brings Apple's CarPlay experience to more Tesla vehicles than ever before.\nAccording to Gapi\u0144ski, version 2022.25.1 provides \"100% functional \u200cCarPlay\u200c integration for any Tesla,\" and comes with several new features and bug fixes.\nThe project now supports DRM video playback so that apps like Netflix function normally, an orientation lock so that apps like Apple Music automatically launch in landscape mode, and the hack now uses Android 12.1 for better stability and performance.\nGapi\u0144ski's CarPlay workaround involves using a Rasberry Pi with an LTE modem and a Wi-Fi access point, running a custom Android-based firmware, as well as a micro-HDMI to HDMI cable and Ethernet cable.\nThe in-car browser is used to connect to the Rasberry Pi and display the \u200c\u200c\u200cCarPlay\u200c\u200c\u200c interface on the Tesla's screen, where Apple apps including Maps and \u200c\u200cApple Music\u200c\u200c function as expected. The system works while driving, and can also be controlled with the media buttons on the Tesla's steering wheel.\nDespite the preponderance of \u200c\u200cCarPlay\u200c\u200c on many electric cars , Tesla does not offer official support. Hints in 2020 that Tesla was planning to support Apple Music never came to fruition, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk doesn't respond to requests on Twitter for the company to bring \u200c\u200cCarPlay\u200c\u200c to its vehicles, despite it being one of the most-requested features among Tesla owners.\nAt the Worldwide Developers Conference 2022, Apple previewed the \"next generation\" of \u200cCarPlay\u200c for compatible vehicles. The next-gen \u200cCarPlay\u200c experience will support multiple displays within a vehicle, offer built-in climate controls for adjusting the temperature of the A/C or heat within the \u200cCarPlay\u200c interface, and more.\nApple said the first vehicles to support the new \u200cCarPlay\u200c experience will be announced in late 2023, with committed automakers including Ford, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Infiniti, Honda, Acura, Jaguar, Land Rover, Audi, Nissan, Volvo, Porsche, and more.",
