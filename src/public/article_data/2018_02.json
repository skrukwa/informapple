        "body": "A file that Apple updated on its website last month provides the first acknowledgment that it's relying on Google 's public cloud for data storage for its iCloud services.\nThe disclosure is fresh evidence that Google's cloud has been picking up usage as it looks to catch up with Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud infrastructure business.\nSome media outlets reported on Google's iCloud win in 2016, but Apple never provided confirmation.\nApple periodically publishes new versions of a PDF called the iOS Security Guide. For years the document contained language indicating that iCloud services were relying on remote data storage systems from Amazon Web Services, as well as Microsoft's Azure.\nBut in the latest version, the Microsoft Azure reference is gone, and in its place is Google Cloud Platform. Before the January update, Apple most recently updated the iOS Security Guide in March.\nThe latest update doesn't indicate whether Apple is using any Google cloud services other than core storage of \"objects\" like photos and videos. The document also doesn't make it clear when Apple started storing data in Google's cloud. Microsoft declined to comment. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.\nEarlier this month Google said its public cloud and its G Suite line of cloud-based productivity apps contribute $1 billion in revenue per quarter. In the fourth quarter, market leader Amazon Web Services brought in $5.11 billion in revenue.\nIn addition to Apple, other Google public cloud customers include Kroger , PayPal , Snap and Spotify.",

This means developers of new apps must ensure they accommodate the notch and go edge-to-edge on the 5.8-inch OLED screen.\nApple has not set a deadline for when updates to existing apps must support iPhone X natively. From April, all new apps must also be built against the iOS 11 SDK.\nIn recent years, Apple has enforced rules more aggressively when it comes to supporting the latest devices.\nApple informed the news in an email today encouraging adoption of the latest iOS 11 features like Core ML, SiriKit and ARKit.\nRequiring compilation with the iOS 11 SDK does not necessarily mean the apps must support new features.\nIt ensures that new app developers are using the latest Apple development tools, which helps prevent the App Store as a whole from going stale, and may encourage adoption of cutting edge features.\nThe rules don\u2019t mean that much until Apple requires updates to also support iPhone X and the iOS 11 SDK, as updates represent the majority of the App Store. Most developers making new apps already target iPhone X as a top priority.\nThe rules come into effect from April 2018.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Early benchmarks shows Samsung Galaxy S9 well behind iPhone X in processor performance",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nThe Samsung Galaxy S9 has a slower processor than the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X, according to early benchmarks of Samsung's new device, after tests of the Android smartphone's Exynos 9810 chip reveal it to lag far behind the Apple-created A10 and A11 processors.\nBenchmarking of a demonstration handset at the Samsung Galaxy S9 launch event by Anandtech shows the Exynos 9810 to be a fast chip, but not as fast as the A10 and A11. Across the battery of tests, Samsung's newest processor, unveiled in January, does outperform its predecessor, but Apple's chips continued to dominate in most of the results.\nAn initial GeekBench 4 single core test recorded integer and floating point scores of 3,734 and 3,440 respectively for the Exynos 9810, but by comparison the A11 scored 4,630 and 3,958 respectively. The A10 also beats Samsung's chip for the Integer score, achieving 4,007, but is just 95 points behind for floating point performance at 3,345.\nThere is no change in position between the three chips when breaking down the scores to a per-megahertz level, as comparing the integer scores reveal the Exynos 9810 scoring 1.38 per megahertz, while the A10 scores 1.71 per megahertz, rising to 1.94 for the A11. For the floating point score, it's the sames story, with the 9810 getting 1.27 points per megahertz compared to the 1.43 points of the A10 and 1.66 of the A11.\nUsing different benchmarks for the phones themselves instead of narrowing down to the processor, the results stayed fairly similar with the iPhone 8 and iPhone X beating the Galaxy S9 Plus. Using WebXPRT 2015, the iPhone X and iPhone 8 score 352 and 349 respectively, almost double the 178 points achieved by the Galaxy S9 Plus.\nUnder Speedometer 2.0, the gap between the devices extends, as the Galaxy S9 Plus scored just 26.70 in the benchmark compared to the 88.90 of the iPhone 8 and 87.20 of the iPhone X.\nIn both of these tests, the iPhone 7 also manages to best the Galaxy S9 Plus, achieving 199 under WebXPRT 2015 and 55.20 under Speedometer 2.0.\nGraph from Anandtech\nAndrei Frumusanu of Anandtech believes there may have been an issue with the device being tested, as it was \"barely able to distinguish itself from last year's Exynos 8895.\" While noting the larger cores were reaching their maximum set clock speed, Frumusanu suggests it could be issues with the scheduler and the DVFS configuration that's causing the handset on show to underperform.\nA Samsung spokesperson did confirm that the demonstration units were running special firmware for Mobile World Congress, adding that it may not be optimized to the hardware as of yet. Frumusanu considers it hard to believe Samsung would limit the performance for their flagship smartphones for the show, nor that the company would alter its scheduler settings for the occasion.\nAnother notable element is that Samsung has clocked the four performance cores used in the Galaxy S9's processor at 2.7 gigahertz, down from the maximum 2.9 gigahertz claimed at the launch of the chip.\nTesting the Mali G72MP18 GPU included in the Galaxy S9 Plus revealed the same story, with its score of 45.70 peak frames per second on GFXBench Manhattan 3.1 beaten by the iPhone 8's 60.34 and the iPhone X's 64.19. Not much change was seen under the GFXBench T-Rex 2.7 test, with the Galaxy S9 Plus peaking at 143.4 frames per second while the iPhone 8 and iPhone X got 171.4 and 176.6 peak framerates.",

        "body": "iPad remains the world's most popular tablet by a significant margin, having outsold competing devices from rivals Samsung and Amazon combined last year, according to data shared by research firm IDC today.\nApple sold a total of 43.8 million iPad units in 2017, as confirmed by its quarterly earnings results, while IDC estimates that Samsung and Amazon shipped 24.9 million and 16.7 million tablets respectively on the year. The combined Samsung-Amazon total of 41.6 million tablets is 2.2 million lower than iPad sales.\nApple captured a 26.8 percent share of the tablet market in 2017, meaning that roughly one in every four tablets sold last year was an iPad. Apple's tablet market share rose 2.5 percentage points year-on-year.\nLast week, Apple reported revenue of $5.8 billion from iPad sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing growth of six percent compared to the year-ago quarter. Apple's average selling price of an iPad was $445, up slightly from $423 in year-ago quarter, suggesting more higher-priced iPad Pro sales.\nApple's growth in iPad sales, albeit relatively flat, contrasted with the overall tablet market's 6.5 percent decline in shipments in 2017 compared to 2016. iPad has been the world's most popular tablet since shortly after it launched.\nShifting focus to this year, Apple is rumored to launch at least one new iPad Pro model with slimmer bezels, no home button, and Face ID. We haven't heard much about the lower-cost 9.7-inch iPad and iPad mini, but each could certainly receive a routine speed bump this year among other upgrades as well.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nSource: New York Daily News\nAs part of a planned switch away from Microsoft's defunct Windows Phone platform, the New York Police Department recently began issuing officers their choice of iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus handsets, devices some cops are already lauding as the \"ultimate tool\" to fight crime.\nOfficers from Patrol Borough Manhattan South lined up outside an old police academy in Gramercy Park on Sunday to pick up their new standard issue equipment, and are among the first to receive iPhone as part of a hardware upgrade strategy, reports New York Daily News.\nAnnounced last year, the shift will see some 36,000 Nokia handsets replaced over the coming weeks. Initially purchased in 2014 as part of a $160 million program to modernize police operations, the Nokia phones running Windows Phone will be collected, wiped and sold back to the company.\nThe move to iPhone 7 comes at no cost to the NYPD, as the handsets are considered upgrades under the agency's contract with AT&T.\nNYPD's rollout began last month when officers patrolling the Bronx and Staten Island swapped their obsolete Nokia smartphones for Apple devices. The department is handing out about 600 iPhones per day, according to NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Information and Technology Jessica Tisch.\nOfficers armed with iPhone will be able to access 911 dispatches, perform criminal background checks, access criminal histories when responding to calls, view video and surveillance photos, and fill out beat reports. The smartphones also make patrolling much safer, as cops responding to a job are provided detailed information about a given address and its potential dangers.\n\"I truly feel like it's the ultimate tool to have as a patrol cop,\" said officer Christopher Clampitt. \"We get to the location a lot quicker,\" he said. \"By the time the dispatcher puts out the job (on the radio) we're already there.\"\nNYPD dispatches are pushed to the department's 911 app before they reach radios, and can be geofenced to reach only those officers located in a specific neighborhood. Last year, for example, Clampitt and his partner were alerted to, and stopped, a robbery in progress before the dispatcher put word out over radio channels.",

Employees have come up with a solution for it, by putting sticky notes on the doors, but they keep getting removed because they detract from the design of the facility, said sources familiar with the matter.\nBloomberg reports that \"there are other markings\" to identify the glass, but didn't make clear if they were improvisational by the employees, or permanent by the developers. If the latter, they don't appear to be working.\nSo far, official Apple channels have not responded to requests for comment. AppleInsider wasn't able to verify the claims of injuries with OSHA, nor its own sources.\nHowever, one of AppleInsider's sources within the company not authorized to speak for Apple was amused by the reports, and said that she \"saw [the impacts] coming, a mile away.\"\nOn Feb. 22, 2017, Apple officially named the \"spaceship\" campus. The entire facility is now called \"Apple Park,\" with the 20-foot tall and 165 foot in diameter glass auditorium honoring one of the founders of the company and named the \"Steve Jobs Theater.\"",

        "body": "This may not come as a huge surprise, but it\u2019s going to be pricey if you break Apple\u2019s fully sealed and densely packed new speaker. Repair pricing for the HomePod was posted to Apple\u2019s website today, and the number is high enough that it\u2019s clear you should invest in a warranty if you\u2019re worried about breaking one: an out-of-warranty repair from Apple will cost $279 in the US, which is 80 percent of the price of a brand-new HomePod. So you\u2019re not so much repairing it as getting a small discount on a new one.\nApple\u2019s warranty only runs for two years, but it\u2019s relatively cheap (as far as Apple warranties go) at just $39 \u2014 though there\u2019s an additional $39 service fee for accidental damage. Two years isn\u2019t a lot of time, particularly for a product that likely has a lifespan of twice that, if not much more.",

        "body": "Not long after Apple finally entered the smart speaker market with the HomePod, it appears there\u2019s further competition on the way. Job ads suggest that Spotify is planning to enter production with its own speaker.\nIt was clear as long ago as last April that Spotify was at least exploring the idea, but new job ads suggest that the company may soon be gearing up for manufacturing \u2026\nMusically spotted the ads.\n\u201cSpotify is on it\u2019s [sic] way creating it\u2019s first physical products and set-up an operational organisation for manufacturing, supply chain, sales & marketing,\u201d explains a not-quite-fully-spell-checked ad for an Operations Manager \u2013 Hardware Product on Spotify\u2019s recruitment site.\nThe role includes handling \u2018distribution, supply, logistics, fulfillment and customer service,\u2019 all functions that the company would need only once it enters the production and sale phases.\nWhile it\u2019s entirely unsurprising that the HomePod supports only Apple Music natively, the lack of Spotify support other than via AirPlay was a contentious point for some. In its own review, the Guardian suggested that \u2018missing true Spotify support will be a deal killer for many.\u2019\nApple isn\u2019t afraid of competition. It launched HomePod into a market already dominated by Amazon\u2019s Echo speakers, with the Google Home range in second place. But existing smart speakers were focused on smarts first, music second, while HomePod is all about the music.\nIt seems likely that Spotify\u2019s speaker will, like HomePod, be very music-focused, making it potentially more of a direct competitor.\nSpotify is planning to take the company public this quarter, not long after hitting 70M subscribers. Streaming music businesses operate on notoriously slim margins, almost all the revenue going to labels and music publishers. Jimmy Iovine said last year that it was \u2018not a great business\u2018 to be in. Moving into the hardware field could provide Spotify with a route into a more profitable operating model.\nPhoto: TechCrunch\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "body": "Apple is considering providing rebates to customers who purchased full-price iPhones before its reduced-cost $29 battery replacements were made available, reports Recode.\nApple confirmed that it is exploring the option following an inquiry from U.S. Senator John Thune, who asked whether Apple would offer rebates to customers who had already purchased new batteries at higher prices.\nHas Apple explored whether consumers who paid the full, non-discounted price for a replacement batter in an effort to restore performance should be allowed to seek a rebate for some of the purchase price?\"\nApple vice president for public policy Cynthia Hogan answered Thune's inquiry today and said that Apple is indeed looking into whether a rebate program can be provided to customers. \"Yes, we are exploring this and will update you accordingly,\" she told Thune.\nApple began offering customers with an iPhone 6 and newer low-cost $29 battery replacements starting in December following outrage over the company's decision to introduce an iPhone-slowing power management feature in older devices.\nThough the power management feature was first introduced in iOS 10.2.1 early in 2017, the details behind how it works were not fully discovered or explained by Apple until December. As it turns out, in older devices with degraded batteries, the power management feature can result in processor throttling at times of peak usage. Replacing the battery in affected devices solves the problem.\nWhen Apple made $29 battery replacements available to customers in late December it also provided some customers who had already made a purchase with refunds, but the company limited refunds to batteries purchased on or after December 14. Customers who purchased a replacement battery before December 14 at the full $79 price have not been able to get their money back.\nShould Apple make a rebate program available to customers who previously made a battery purchase, it would presumably cover customers who purchased replacement batteries earlier in the year.",

        "title": "The size of iphone apps has increased by 1000% in 4 years",
        "body": "As the minimum storage capacity of iPhone continues to increase\u2014it sits at 32 GB today on the iPhone 7, double the the iPhone 5S's 16 GB circa 2013\u2014it's not surprising that the size of apps themselves is getting larger. In fact, Apple raised the app size cap from 2 GB to 4 GB in early 2015. What's surprising is how much faster they're increasing in size compared to device storage itself.\nAccording to Sensor Tower's analysis of App Intelligence, the total space required by the top 10 most installed U.S. iPhone apps has grown from 164 MB in May 2013 to about 1.9 GB last month, a 12x or approximately 1,100 percent increase in just four years. In the following report, we delve deeper into which apps have grown the most.\nMost Growth Has Occurred in the Past Year\nAs you can see in the chart below, while none of the top 10 apps\u2014which include Facebook, Uber, Gmail, Snapchat, Spotify, Messenger, Google Maps, YouTube, Instagram, and Netflix\u2014are larger than a few hundred megabytes individually, they all began to increase in size after Apple raised the maximum app size to 4 GB in February 2015.\nBefore this point, apps were limited to a maximum of 2 GB, with the core executable capped at 100 MB of that (the latter is still the case). Of course, apps can take up additional storage on a user's device; Apple's limit applies to what can be initially downloaded from the App Store. For the purposes of our analysis, we only looked at the core app size, not the total storage footprint of an app plus additional content.\nAlso noticeable above is a further acceleration in app size increase following the September 2016 rollout of iOS 10, but as we'll get to in the next section, there's a more specific reason for a lot of this growth among the top 10 apps in particular.\nSome Apps Have Grown More Than Others\nOf the top 10 most popular U.S. iPhone apps, the minimum growth we saw in app size since May 2013 was 6x for Spotify. As the chart above shows, other apps, especially Snapchat, have grown considerably more.\nIn fact, Snapchat is more than 50 times larger than it was four years ago, clocking in at 203 MB versus just 4 MB at the start of the period we looked at. It's not the largest app among the top 10, however. That distinction goes to Facebook, which, at 388 MB, is 12 times larger than it was in May 2013 when it occupied 32 MB. It grew by about 100 MB in one update during September of last year.\nGmail is another standout in terms of sudden app size growth, having grown from 41 MB last October to 197 MB in November (an almost 5x or 380 percent increase) after a redesign.\nWe see the often sudden growth in size exhibited by apps such as Facebook and Snapchat as directly tied to the intense competition between them, which necessitates a steady rollout of new and more space-intensive features. Of course, some apps have likely grown in size simply due to a reduced need (or perception of a need) for optimization.\nGames Grew Too, As Expected\nUnlike an email app, mobile games are expected to increase in size as both their complexity and the amount (and quality) of their audiovisual content increases over time to match the fidelity of the newest devices.\nLooking at two specific examples, the ever-popular top 10 title Clash of Clans has grown from 49 MB to 116 MB over this period (a bit more than 2x) and Candy Crush Saga has grown about 4.6x from 48 MB to 223 MB. Meanwhile, the initial download for a graphically cutting-edge game, such as the recently launched Injustice 2, sits at 1 GB\u2014more than the entire top 10 grossing list from May 2013.\nApple's Answer: Smarter Storage\nApple is clearly aware of the storage requirements being placed on modern iOS devices by developers. In fact, iOS 11 will introduce new features to help users make the most of the storage they have, including offering suggestions about infrequently used apps and the option to offload them\u2014removing the core app while retaining all its settings and data for when they're needed again. This should help owners of storage-strapped devices and those whose downloading habits are well above average.",

        "body": "Since iPhone 7, Apple has shared baseband chip orders for iPhones with Qualcomm and Intel. For the 2018 iPhones, KGI reports that Apple is set to rely on Intel as the exclusive supplier, amidst Apple\u2019s ongoing legal battles with Qualcomm.\nKGI says Intel can meet Apple\u2019s technical requirements and offers more competitive prices.\nIn November, KGI reported that Apple will improve LTE transmission speeds significantly by supporting 4\u00d74 MIMO chipsets. At the time, Ming-Chi Kuo believed Apple would give about 30% of the orders to Qualcomm.\nHe is now claiming that Qualcomm will be excluded from 2018 iPhones altogether. However, KGI does not rule out Qualcomm returning to the supply chain, perhaps as concessions in the patent lawsuit settlement.\nKGI says there\u2019s also a risk that Intel may not be ready for 5G networking as quickly as Qualcomm, which may also force Apple\u2019s hand.\nOnce again, KGI says Intel\u2019s chip will support dual SIM and dual standby. However, there are no direct claims that Apple will make an iPhone model with two physical SIM slots.\nIn the past, benchmarks of iPhone models have shown that units with the Qualcomm baseband chipset performed slightly better than the model with the Intel internals. This discrepancy will not exist if Apple gets all of its chips from one supplier in the 2018 iPhone lineup.",

I noticed it was still showing up in my Find My iPhone app. Well, at first I didn\u2019t realize it was that particular Mac. I just happened to notice there was a computer I didn\u2019t recognize in Find My iPhone called \u201cMichael\u2019s iMac\u201d.\nI clicked in and saw a computer that wasn\u2019t mine showing up on a map about 100 miles north of my house.\nblurred for privacy\nI vaguely remembered selling an iMac on Craigslist 3 years ago, and figured that was this one. Then I realized that meant for over 3 years, I had access to this person\u2019s exact location. That\u2019s insane to me.\nHow the hell did that happen?\nBefore selling, I erased the computer and re-installed a fresh MacOS\nI did a hard erase of the computer and reinstalled MacOS factory fresh. The mistake I made was that before erasing the computer, I didn\u2019t sign out of iCloud / Find My Mac. I figured erasing the computer would do that. It didn\u2019t.\nI sold the computer and the user didn\u2019t log into iCloud\nFor whatever reason, this person didn\u2019t need to sign into iCloud. So this meant that Apple still associated the computer hardware with my iCloud account. The computer wasn\u2019t logged into my iCloud account, but was still associated with my account, so I still could track the computer\u2019s location in real time.\nFor me (the seller), this isn\u2019t much of a security risk\nThe buyer won\u2019t see or have access to any private iCloud data; the hardware is just associated with it. But the seller can\u2019t disassociate it without the buyer\u2019s help (and I didn\u2019t have any way to contact them), so it\u2019s a pain.\nNo, logging all devices out of iCloud doesn\u2019t work. And no, this has nothing to do with if the computer is in your Support Profile.\nThe only options I had were Play Sound, Lock, and Erase.\nFor the buyer, there are massive privacy concerns\nThe biggest privacy issue is for the buyer. If they don\u2019t turn on Find My Mac with their own iCloud account, they leave a lot of power in the previous owner\u2019s hands.\nThe previous owner can track the buyer\u2019s location.\nAt any time in the past 3 years I could have tracked this computer\u2019s exact location. Not a huge deal with an iMac, but if this was a laptop, I\u2019d basically know where this person was at all times. Terrifying.\nThe previous owner can erase everything remotely.\nWith two clicks, at any point, I could shut down this user\u2019s computer and completely wipe it clean. They couldn\u2019t stop it and would have no control. They\u2019d lose everything.\nThe previous owner can lock the buyer out.\nThis is what I ended up doing. It was the only way I could get in touch with the owner. So I remotely locked the computer and in the lock message, put my phone number.\nThe new owner texted and we got it resolved. As mentioned, it wasn\u2019t that they were still logged into my iCloud account, it was that they never signed into their own iCloud account.\nResolving it showed one last nugget of privacy ugh\nWhen Michael finally logged into his own iCloud account and turned on Find My Mac, the computer was nice enough to tell him my full name.\nNot a huge deal, but for people who want to remain anonymous when selling a computer, this sucks.",

There are alternatives that definitely sound better from Bose, B&O Play, and other. But they often cost more and all of them experience occasional audio dropouts. AirPods don\u2019t. I\u2019d argue they\u2019re maybe the best first-gen product Apple has ever made. Unfortunately, I\u2019m one of the sad souls whose ears just aren\u2019t a match for the AirPods \u2014 and I\u2019m a nerd who likes having both an iPhone and Android phone around \u2014 so I\u2019ve been searching for the best non-Apple option.\nBut some 14 months after AirPods shipped, there\u2019s still no clear cut competitor that\u2019s truly better at the important stuff. They all lack the magic sauce that is Apple\u2019s W1 chip, which improves pairing, range, and battery life for the AirPods. At this point I think it\u2019s fair to say that Bluetooth alone isn\u2019t enough to make these gadgets work smoothly. Hopefully the connection will be more sturdy once more earbuds with Bluetooth 5 hit the market. And Qualcomm is also putting in work to help improve reliability.\nThat\u2019s not to say these options are all terrible; they\u2019re not. If you\u2019re using them in a place where you\u2019re unlikely to deal with much signal interference, several are fine choices. Samsung, Sony, Bragi, Bose, and others are worth looking at. Each has its own advantages and drawbacks. All of them are more flexible in regards to fit with different options (including Comply foam tips in some cases). The Bose SoundSport Free has the best bass response of the bunch, for example, but they\u2019re basically useless for video since there\u2019s a substantial audio delay. That\u2019s an issue shared by several of these, and some of them only route phone calls to one ear, which can be annoying. A few provide built-in fitness tracking, but I\u2019ve got enough devices that are capable of that. I just want the things to work great and sound nice. The second half is already there \u2014 and many of these earbuds let you customize the EQ \u2014 but I need rock-solid playback.",

        "title": "Designing a better notification experience for iOS [Concept]",
        "body": "As a huge tech fan and someone that works in the industry, I own of a lot of gadgets, especially smartphones. I have devices that run Android, Windows or even Ubuntu Touch, however my daily driver is an iPhone X simply because iOS is by far my favourite operating system to use. It works seamlessly with my Mac and iPad, it receives frequent software updates and the quality of apps in the store is just great. I really like the ecosystem, however there are some areas it could definitely improve on. This article is about exploring some of the opportunities around the current notification system to make it even better.\nThe problem\nThe iOS 11 notification system, oh boy. Especially the messages that sit on your lock screen. They play such a big role in the user experience of your phone. We spend around 4 hours on our phones every day. We have multiple apps installed that constantly try to communicate with us in a form of a notification and processing all that information can be quite overwhelming.\nIncoming messages on a normal day on iOS (courtesy of WeezyWally)\nI\u2019d love if my phone could help me filter out the noise and understand all these messages quickly and easily. The way the current system works just seem to make people frustrated. A lot of users complain about this information overload and how much they would love this to be fixed on iOS. You can find threads and videos where people express their strong opinions on the matter as notifications can be quite unreadable in this current form.\nMany apps don\u2019t follow the Apple guidelines either and send out multiple, repetitive notifications meaning that frequency is definitely something iOS needs to start optimizing for. There are just so many opportunities for improvements.\nAt the moment single notifications take up a lot space visually \u2014 and depending on your device \u2014 even 4 notifications can fill up your whole lock screen. When you have double or triple this amount, you will then enter the scrolling game and it becomes very easy to miss messages.\nCurrent iOS 11 Notifications\nIf you\u2019re a light user or limit the number of notifications you receive, you\u2019re probably okay with this current system. As humans we get used to things, even if it\u2019s not well designed. However if you're a heavy user and receive dozens of new notifications a day, you\u2019re starting to see why this is such a problem, its almost a guarantee that it will make you frustrated.\nThe current solution to this today is to switch notifications off completely or change your preferences within the apps, but none of these seem to the best ways to approach the problem as you will be missing out on quite a lot that might be relevant to you. I believe there are 2 better ways this could be solved and it wouldn't require an entire restuctre from Apple to build this on top of iOS 11.\nGroup by App\nFirst off: the \u2018Group by App\u2019 feature. A couple years ago iOS 9 had this option and allowed you to group notifications by app. Why was this good? Well, messages were much easier to read through as they were organzied in such a nice manner. It was just easier to undertsand what\u2019s going on and what really needs your attention. Meaningless notifications were easier to dismiss and important ones stood out more. But the decision was in your hands and you were in control on how you prioritise.\niOS 9 Notifications\nAnd because of that, I knew that many long-time users already had an idea of this system, how it works and why to use so this was definitely an inspiration.\nI\u2019ve tried to look at dozens of different variations and ways to go about solving the problem for the sake of making sure the solution is as simple, intuitive and familiar as possible. These 3 pillars were always at the front of my thinking.\nVersion 1\nI\u2019ve been thinking about how version 1 of this new feature might work in iOS 11 because I didn\u2019t want to drastically change the current system so the learning curve would be smaller for users. Bigger changes could be rolled out overtime, incrementally if needed.\nSo what changes would be absolutely essential for the first release?\nPen and paper is still my favourite approach to sketch out some rough ideas to see what solutions I can come up with. After heavy research, I\u2019ve had a few iterations that looked quite good on paper and made a lot of sense so I decided to turn them into wireframes. I\u2019ve used Sketch Mirror to send these to my phone and see how it feels. There were around 4 versions that also made it into a prototype in an attempt to try to making it even more realistic.\nBut like I mentioned before, the solution had to be simple, intuitive and familiar, so many just didn\u2019t fit all 3. They either wouldn\u2019t fit the current visual style, wouldn\u2019t accommodate some edge-cases or were quite tricky to quickly understand how it works. However I had two at the \u2018end\u2019 that stood the challenge so I went onto testing it with a wide range of apps to see if the framework would fit them but also emailed a bunch of people that I know uses an iPhone to gather some intial feedback from them. Finally I had something I could work with.\nLimitations\nWhat made this excersise challenging was the limitations. Notifications have to fit many different needs so there are a lot of them. They have work cross-platform (Mac, iPad, Watch, iPhone), fit the current visual system, be intuitive and most importantly, accommodate the needs of so many applications and use cases. Some apps send short and concise messages, some like to attach rich media files and add a lot of text that makes them large and look crowded.\nAnd then there are also times when you have several notifications from multiple senders within the same app or have a dozen from only one sender, how would you group those? What if you have have 20 or 30 incoming messages from one app only, how would that look like? But there are so much more I probably wouldn\u2019t even know without working there like technicaly constraints.\nThe new system\nKeeping all of the above in mind, I\u2019ve created a new system that I believe works well across all of these scenarios. Compared to iOS 11, the changes are not drastic for single notifications. I brought the header back from iOS 10 so it looks somewhat similar to the current widgets. I have also moved the timestamp into the content area to indicate when a specific notification was sent out and also create space for expand indicator which I will explain later in the multiple notifications section. Slight, but very important changes.\nA closer look\nLet\u2019s take a look at the notification breakdown. This is the anatomy of individual notifications so you would only see this them in this form if you receive less then 2 notification from one app or not have the Group by App feature enabled at all.\nI separated the notification into 2 parts: header and content. Every notifications will have both of these areas. The header helps seperate the app and its content so now theres more focus on the latter. By simply removing the timestamps from the header and attaching it to the content itself, we now have the opportunity to place multiple messages into the content area instead of just a single one but it also makes room for expand indicator in the header when we it comes to grouping messages.\nLike I mentioned before, iOS 9 allowed you to group notifications by app as an optional feature and I would be bringing this back. A single on/off toggle that would easily active or deactivate the grouping feature. Not everyone would prefer this system so having flexibility is definitely great.\nNow let\u2019s look at how the grouping would actually look like. After you enable the \u2018Group by App\u2019 toggle in Settings, you will need to receive at least 2 notifications from one app to see the grouped container appear. Notifications would be merged by creating 1 container that holds all of the content inside. It would have the app header and counter in the content area with the amount of unread notifications you currently have. You would also see an expand indicator appear (Show More/Show Less) which looks and works the same way as it would for a widget.\nAnd with this, now you have the option to open the container to see more or keep them hidden depening on your preferences. One thing to mention here is that once messages are grouped, you won\u2019t be able to interact with individual messages (quick response, archive etc), so any action you now take would affect the whole group as one. Open, respond, clear etc. I felt that when you have multiple notifications, the two most common actions would be to open the app or dismiss the messages so I didn\u2019t think the need for that level of detail would be essential for version 1.\nThis is how it looks like in action when you only have a few messages grouped:\nSmall group\nAnother use case of this feature is when you receive 10 or more notifications from one app. In this case you will have a call-to-action indicating the total amount and prompting you to open the app to see all of them. Chances are, when you have that many, you would like to react to them so you would need to open the app or dismiss all you don\u2019t have to think about it at that moment.\nThis version would allow you to do both. A single swipe can get rid of all your grouped notifications instead of having to close each of them one by one. And all the notifications are in order with the most recent on top so you can be up-to-date on your lock screen just like today.\nLarge group\nAnd now instead of a long list, you have a much cleaner and organised look. Of course, your screen could still look very crowded if you receive a lot of messages, but it\u2018s much easier and less time consuming to go through the list when the information you see in front of you is well-organized.\nCurrent iOS 11 vs New Group by App feature\nMute notifications\nAnother feature the \u2018Group by App\u2019 system would make possible is the to option mute or snooze notifications temporarily for a short period of time.\nOn iOS 11, you have the option to disable all easily if you really want to focus on something. Apple introduced the Do Not Disturb While Driving mode not long ago which is great and very useful, but I would love to see even more flexibility. What if you\u2019re working, studying or doing something else that requires a level of focus? An on/off solution doesn\u2019t always work well in all situations and muting only certain notifications would come very handy at times. It would give you more flexibility and even more control of you lock screen.\nLet\u2019s say you upload a new photo to Instagram or tweet something that receives a lot of attention for an hour or two. You will receive a ton on new notifications and it can quickly become very annoying. At the moment its a very binary option, you either have notifications turned on or turned off so you decide completely disable them then you have re-enable them later on. Every app, every time.\nI think this feature could be introduced quite seamlessly once you have the \u2018Group by App\u2019 system enabled as it would sit nicely in the swipe left gesture, in-between the current View and Clear options. One you select it, a simple modal could prompt you to select a timeframe you would like to mute them for and all done. Users could also change or revert changes in Settings anytime they prefer.\nI believe that with the combination of these two features, it would be a pretty good first step into making the overall user experience even better and provide a system that honestly cares about the people behind these devices and value their time more.\nThere are of course more features that could make the notification system even better that I didn\u2019t touch on this time like security, better quick action gestures or notification sounds/lights to keep it shorter, but I see myself touching on those points as well later on.\nFeedback\nI realise that this might be a quick fix and woud need some further research and testing to be done in order to find a truly great system that works even more seamlessly, however I do not work for Apple so this is just a brief suggestion. And I\u2019m sure they\u2019re already working on this.\nAlso, I would love to hear your feedback.\nIf you\u2019re an iPhone user or someone that works at Apple, do you think this is a problem? If so, what do you think of this solution?\nThank you for reading and don\u2019t forget to say hi on Twitter!",

The company came in at number four on the list last year, but has jumped to the top spot this go around thanks to the iPhone X, ARKit, and more\u2026\nFast Company explains that Apple\u2019s 2017 saw it release the AirPods, Apple Watch Series 3, ARKit, and iPhone X \u2013 all of which became popular sellers in their respective categories.\nFor a company slagged for not having had a hit since the iPad in 2010, Apple had a notable 2017: Its wireless AirPods became ubiquitous around the country; the Apple Watch Series 3 is a bestseller; developers embraced ARKit, its AR framework; and even skeptics were blown away by the iPhone X.\nFurthermore, Apple is praised for its \u201cambitious\u201d software and hardware projects, ranging from its chip development work, to cameras, and much more. Artificial intelligence is also a point of advantage for Apple, where Fast Company says the company \u201chas made major inroads\u201d despite competition from Google and Amazon.\nSpecifically, Fast Company notes Apple\u2019s privacy-centric approach to artificial intelligence, where most of the work is done on the device itself:\nFor instance, it uses AI techniques to wring as much life as possible out of the iPhone\u2019s battery. Because of Apple\u2019s privacy-driven decision to limit the amount of information it aggregates and analyzes in the cloud, it also does much of its AI right on the devices rather than using massive server farms.\nComing in behind Apple on the most innovative company list is Netflix in second place, Square in third, Tencent in fourth, and Amazon \u2013 last year\u2019s winner \u2013 in fifth. Rounding out the top 10 are Patagonia, CVS Health, The Washington Post, Spotify, and the NBA.\nRead the full list of the top 50 most innovative companies right here.\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

So you can bet that we're pulling that string,\" Cook said.\nGoing forward, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said in answer to a question about slower growth in the coming quarter that Apple believes iPhone revenue will actually grow double digits compared to last year's March quarter. iPhone sell-through growth, he says, will be accelerating compared to the December quarter.\nApple's guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 includes expected revenue of $60-$62 billion and gross margin between 38 and 38.5 percent.",

        "title": "The Apple Watch can detect diabetes with an 85% accuracy, Cardiogram study says",
        "body": "According to Cardiogram founder Brandon Ballinger\u2019s latest clinical study, the Apple Watch can detect diabetes in those previously diagnosed with the disease with an 85 percent accuracy.\nThe study is part of the larger DeepHeart study with Cardiogram and UCSF. This particular study used data from 14,000 Apple Watch users and was able to detect that 462 of them had diabetes by using the Watch\u2019s heart rate sensor, the same type of sensor other fitness bands using Android Wear also integrate into their systems.\nIn 2015, the Framingham Heart Study showed that resting heart rate and heart rate variability significantly predicted incident diabetes and hypertension. This led to the impetus to use the Watch\u2019s heart rate sensor to see if it could accurately detect a diabetic patient.\nPreviously, Ballinger and his colleagues were able to use Apple\u2019s Watch to detect an abnormal heart rhythm with up to a 97 percent accuracy, sleep apnea with a 90 percent accuracy and hypertension with an 82 percent accuracy when paired with Cardiogram\u2019s AI-based algorithm. Most of these discoveries have been published in clinical journals or abstracts and Ballinger intends to publish the latest findings shortly after presenting at the AAAI 2018 conference this week.\nDiabetes is a huge \u2014 and growing \u2014 problem in the U.S. More than 100 million U.S. adults are now living with pre-diabetes or diabetes and more than 1 in 4 of them go undiagnosed, according to the CDC. Part of the problem is the pain that goes into checking blood glucose levels. A patient must prick themselves after every meal and correctly take the right amount of insulin to keep themselves in balance.\nEarly detection could also help in cutting down on diabetes-related diseases before they get out of hand. While there have been other attempts to build special-purpose glucose-sensing hardware, this is the first large-scale study showing that ordinary heart rate sensors\u2014when paired with an artificial intelligence-based algorithm\u2014can identify diabetes with no extra hardware.\nSo what\u2019s next? Ballinger and his colleague on the study Johnson Hsieh mentioned they could be looking at a number of diseases to detect through heart sensors, possibly even gestational diabetes. Hsieh also cautions that those tested were already known to have diabetes or pre-diabetes and that anyone who thinks they might have it should go to their doctor, not just rely on the Watch to tell them what\u2019s going on.\nBut the results are promising. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see what else the Apple Watch and other fitness monitors with a built-in heart rate sensor are able to tell us about ourselves next.",

        "title": "Verizon will begin locking iPhones to its network starting this spring",
        "body": "Verizon is currently the only major carrier that doesn\u2019t lock its iPhones and other smartphones upon purchase, but that is now set to change this spring.\nReported by CNET, Verizon shared today that it will begin locking phones it sells starting sometime this spring. The carrier curiously says this move is an attempt to reduce theft and fraud.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking steps to combat this theft and reduce fraud,\u201d Tami Erwin, executive vice president of wireless operations for Verizon, said in a statement. \u201cThese steps will make our phones exponentially less desirable to criminals.\u201d\nCNET notes that Verizon hasn\u2019t mentioned how long it will be locking devices after purchase. AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile all lock smartphones for a period of 40-60 days after purchase. These carriers have other variances for their unlocking policies as well.\nWhile this may help Verizon prevent attempted theft and fraud, it will likely create new frustration for customers who are interested in traveling abroad or needing to switch carriers within the locked period.\nFor now, the carrier hasn\u2019t shared any further details about this rollout except that it will unlock devices whether or not they are paid off once the to-be-determined lock period is up.\nWhile SIM-free unlocked iPhone models aren\u2019t typically available immediately at launch, they are currently available for all iPhone models at this point.\nFor Apple\u2019s part, the company offers a separate Activation Lock feature that prevents lost or stolen iPhones from being activated without supplying the original owner\u2019s email and password used with the device.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Receiving an Indian character crashes Messages and other apps in iOS 11",
        "body": "Update: It\u2019s now been confirmed that the issue affects both Macs and Apple Watches too.\nThere have been a number of cases where sending a particular message to an iOS device causes the Messages app to crash, leaving users unable to re-open it \u2013 and a new one has emerged in iOS 11.\nSending a specific Telugu (Indian language) character to a device running iOS 11.2.5 causes the app to crash, and then fail to re-open. In some cases, it can require a DFU reset to fix it \u2026\nThe bug was first spotted by Italian site Mobile World, which notes that the character will crash any app in which it is displayed \u2013 not just Messages.\nIf the character is displayed within an application (WhatsApp, Twitter, etc.), the app in question will crash and will continue to close each time you try to start it. The situation gets worse if someone sends you the symbol and iOS tries to show it in a notification: in this case, the entire Springboard (ie the system software that manages the Home) will be blocked.\nThe site cautions you to wait for Springboard to restart, as forcing a full reboot as this point will put the device into a boot-loop, where the device continually restarts. If this happens, only a DFU restore can fix it.\nThe Verge confirmed the bug, and pointed to one potential way to resolve it.\nWe\u2019ve tested it successfully on multiple iPhones running iOS 11.2.5 [\u2026] It appears that the only way to regain access to your iMessages is to have another friend send you a message and try to delete the thread that contained the bad character.\nThe Verge noted that the issue is fixed in the public beta of iOS 11.3, suggesting that Apple is aware of it.\nApple is reportedly delaying some major iOS features until next year in order to focus on stability and performance in iOS 12.\nThe character is shown below (as a graphic, to guard against making it easy for people to maliciously send it).\nPhoto: Chris Velazco/Engadget\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Rumor: AirPower and refreshed AirPods case may launch next month!",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nA very thin rumor on Wednesday claims Apple will start shipping the AirPower wireless charging mat and AirPods wireless charging case in late March, both hotly anticipated items unveiled during the company's iPhone event in September.\nCiting an unnamed \"tipster\" from Best Buy, The Apple Post reports the big box retailer and Apple Authorized Reseller will begin sales of AirPower and the wireless AirPods charging case \u2014 packaged with AirPods \u2014 next month.\nAccording to the source, Best Buy is set to initiate online and in-store sales on the same day as Apple, a strategy in line with past accessory launches including Apple Pencil.\nThe Apple Post does not have a reliable track record in predicting Apple product launches, so the following information should be taken with a heft grain of salt.\nIf the tipster is correct, it seems Apple intends to sell standalone wireless AirPods charging cases exclusively through its own retail stores, leaving third-party resellers like Best Buy to sell the item as a package with new AirPods.\nAt its unveiling, and in subsequent promotional content, Apple describes the wireless AirPods case as \"optional,\" suggesting other retailers will stock two AirPods SKUs, one with a traditional Lightning connection and another featuring inductive elements.\nAn exact release date was not provided, but the tipster said Best Buy would receive sales stock and demo units in late March.\nAnnounced at Apple's iPhone event in September, AirPower is an inductive charging pad capable of juicing up multiple devices simultaneously. For example, AirPower boasts sufficient throughput to charge an iPhone, Apple Watch and the wireless-compatible AirPods case at the same time.\nSpecifications for the charging mat and new AirPods case are unknown, as is pricing. Rumors last year pegged the charging pad at $199, while a separate report claimed Apple will charge $69 for a wireless AirPods case replacement.",
