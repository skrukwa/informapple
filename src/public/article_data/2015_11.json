        "body": "err404 said: It was never about being cocky or stubborn. It was about Google wanting access to user data that Apple wouldn't hand over. Google thought they had Apple over the barrel, but Apple ramped up their own maps and dropped Google. It's just business. Apple's model has always been to avoid being dependent upon any single vendor. Tim always has a back out plan. Click to expand...\nThat's a terrific warm and fuzzy story suggesting that Apple is on high. At the top of the mountain looking down on \"their people\" ... protecting them, Apples keeping them safe from harm.A vast number of iPhone users actually believe this. They believe the Apple corporation is not like the rest, that Apple is not hyper focused on fat profits (as all corporations rightly do ) but more concerned with protecting their flock.With a pile of evidence so high you can't see over it (our cash) the faithful sing Apples praises. A very impressive demonstration of the power and control of the late Steve Jobs.",

Right now I can take a pair of Samsung or Apple headphones and plug them into just about every computer or stereo in the world.

        "title": "Opinion: Apple is right to stand firm on encryption however much terrorist attacks ramp up the pressure",
        "body": "Nobody who watched the news coverage of the terrorist attacks in Paris could fail to be moved by the scenes and the stories emerging from it. It was undeniably a horrific series of events, and it\u2019s only human nature to want action to be taken to reduce the likelihood of future such atrocities.\nBut there is always a danger at such times that emotion, rather than rational thought, will drive government policy-making. I won\u2019t get into the broader theme there, as there are more appropriate forums for that, but there is one aspect that is very much on-topic for us: the battle between Apple and governments over encryption.\nThere have already been unattributed reports that the terrorists in Paris used encrypted communication. I have no idea whether there is any specific evidence for that, but it would hardly be damning were such evidence to emerge: it would be frankly astonishing if they hadn\u2019t.\nThere are three reasons why Apple is right to maintain that it will continue to offer end-to-end encrypted communication no matter how much governments in the USA, UK and elsewhere may protest \u2026\nBut let\u2019s begin with a reminder of Apple\u2019s position. Apple uses end-to-end encryption for both iMessages and FaceTime. As Tim Cook told Charlie Rose last year, this means that it would be impossible for it to decrypt the messages even if a government insisted.\nWe\u2019re not reading your email, we\u2019re not reading your iMessages. If the government laid a subpoena on us to get your iMessages, we can\u2019t provide it. It\u2019s encrypted and we don\u2019t have the key.\nThe company also introduced strong encryption for iPhones and iPads in iOS 8 so that it would again be impossible for the company to break into the device locked with a passcode.\nSo Apple is going further here than most companies. It is not just saying it would push back against government pressure to reveal user data, it is saying that it has deliberately arranged things so that it is completely unable to do so.\nThat\u2019s a strong position, and there\u2019s some pretty heavy-duty opposition to it \u2013 including the United States Attorney General, the FBI, the DOJ and other law-enforcement agencies. Among the claims you\u2019ll find in those links are that Apple is putting people beyond the law, risking the life of a child and that the iPhone would be the terrorists\u2019 \u201ccommunication device of choice.\u201d Since the Paris attacks, the Homeland Security Committee and CIA have joined in.\nSo what are the three reasons that I still think Apple\u2019s position is right?\nFirst, there is nothing new about having to balance out the conflicting demands of freedom and security. Or, to use Benjamin Franklin\u2019s terms, liberty and safety.\nThose who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.\nWe live in a world where it would be technologically feasible to ensure that virtually no crime could go undetected. We could fit CCTV cameras on every street, in every home, in every building. We could all have trackers embedded beneath our skin. We could force everyone to provide both fingerprints and DNA samples to hold in a global database. We could make it illegal to fit curtains or blinds to windows. And so on.\nWe don\u2019t do any of these things because we value freedom and privacy, and we consider that the risks involved are a price worth paying for the ability to live our lives free from tyranny and surveillance.\nThe Snowden revelations woke the world to the extent to which we\u2019d already headed down this slippery slope, and the general view of the population has been that indiscriminate mass surveillance is a step too far. We take the view that wiretaps and other forms of electronic surveillance will of course be necessary to facilitate investigations by police and security services, but that such surveillance should be both targeted and subject to judicial oversight.\nSecond, Apple is absolutely right to say that the moment you build in a backdoor for use by governments, it will only be a matter of time before hackers figure it out.\nYou cannot have an encryption system which is only a little bit insecure any more than you can be a little bit pregnant. Encryption systems are either secure or they\u2019re not \u2013 and if they\u2019re not then it\u2019s a question of when, rather than if, others are able to exploit the vulnerability.\nCouple a deliberately weakened form of encryption to laws requiring Internet service providers and telecoms companies to stockpile large volumes of user data and you\u2019d create the biggest goldmine the world has ever seen for criminals to commit identity theft and other forms of fraud. Not just private enterprise criminals, either, but rogue nations too.\nThink how cautious we have to be today. We\u2019ve all received convincing-looking phishing emails in amongst the laughable ones. Most of us these days, when we receive a phone call claiming to be from a bank, take their name, hang up and then call them back on the main switchboard number. Just imagine how much more paranoid we\u2019d have to be if a fraudster could \u2018prove\u2019 that they are the claimed bank or other company by providing some transaction data.\nA world in which all of our data is \u2018protected\u2019 by encryption systems with loopholes would be a nightmare.\nThird, it won\u2019t work. It\u2019s technological illiteracy to imagine that breaking encrypted messages is any kind of solution.\nDo governments seriously imagine that if we pass laws banning fully-encrypted communications that terrorists would suddenly abandon them and use the new, deliberately weakened versions? Or if doing so drew too much attention to them that they wouldn\u2019t find other ways to hide their communications?\nSteganography, for example. It\u2019s technically trivial to embed hidden messages inside what appears to be a perfectly ordinary family photo in such a way that it\u2019s almost impossible to detect. There are literally scores of apps to do that, and that\u2019s just a single method. There are almost endless numbers of ways to disguise messages.\nAs Tim Cook has said:\nWe shouldn\u2019t give in to scare-mongering or to people who fundamentally don\u2019t understand the details.\nSo weakening encryption would mean sacrificing core principles of civilized societies in the name of security. It would provide not just our own government but foreign governments and criminals with access to our data. And it would do absolutely nothing to prevent terrorists from communicating in secret.\nThere is not one single reason for Apple to give in to government pressure to abandon its stance on customer privacy, and three very good reasons for it not to.\nDo you agree? Or do you think that governments are right to insist that security must take precedence over privacy? Take our poll, and share your thoughts in the comments.",

        "title": "Apple Is Losing Some of Its Most Music-Obsessed Users Because of iTunes | WIRED",
        "body": "At the start of the millennium, Apple famously set out to upend the music business by dragging it into the digital realm. The iTunes store provided an easy way of finding and buying music, and iTunes provided an elegant way of managing it. By 2008, Apple was the biggest music vendor in the US. But with its recent shift toward streaming media, Apple risks losing its most music-obsessed users: the collectors.\nMost of iTunes' latest enhancements exist solely to promote the recommendation-driven Apple Music, app downloads, and iCloud. Users interested only in iTunes' media management features\u2014people with terabytes of MP3s who want a solid app to catalog and organize their libraries\u2014feel abandoned as Apple moves away from local file storage in favor of cloud-based services. These music fans (rechristened \"power users\" in the most recent lingo) are looking for alternatives to Apple's market-dominating media management software, and yearn for a time when listening to music didn't require being quite so connected.\nSo Long, and Thanks for All the Rips\nFor longtime customers, threats of \"I'm quitting Apple\" are the digital equivalent of the eternal promise to ditch Manhattan, San Francisco, or fill-in-the-blank for someplace more affordable and tolerable. But unlike moving out of town, moving out of iTunes is feasible. TJ Connelly\u2014a DJ for the Boston Red Sox, the New England Patriots, WZBC, and elsewhere\u2014wrote the impassioned step-by-step manual \"I Deleted My Entire iTunes Library and You Can Too!\"\nWhen iTunes, started, he says, it was essentially a music player. That changed with iTunes 4.0 in 2003. \"You got the music store, and that was awesome,\" he says. But the iTunes Store introduced a new set of concerns and UI decisions. To prevent piracy, Apple made it impossible to move music from an iPod or iPhones or iPad back to a computer. More controversially, the iTunes Store locked all files with DRM from 2003 until 2007, when Steve Jobs personally lobbied for its removal.\nApple's frequent function-shuffling in iTunes has long been an irritation.\nBut Connelly, who's been an Apple user since the 1980s, understands all that. Where it started to go wrong was with the extras no one asked for, and few used. Genius. Ping. Movies. Podcasts. Ringtones. iTunes University. \"They just kept adding more crap into the app,\" he says. \"I don't even know how many things just showed up in the task bar that I had to turn off. Then [with an iPhone] mobile apps also end up in the music player to control your phone.\" (Apple declined to comment in any way for this story.)",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nSource: Canaccord Genuity\nApple's share of total smartphone industry profits grew to 94 percent during the September quarter, up from 85 percent one year ago.\nThe iPhone maker's overwhelming share of all smartphone income comes despite Apple being second in smartphone volume shipments to all vendors collectively selling devices running some form of Android software.\nAccording to Canaccord Genuity research, Samsung, the largest Android licensee by far, took a distant 11 percent share of total operating income. Those numbers exceed 100 percent because most other phone makers reported negative operating income.\nCanaccord analysts Mike Walkley blamed some of the losses suffered by HTC, BlackBerry, Sony and Lenovo (which now owns Google's former Motorola subsidiary) on their inability to compete in the market for higher end phones priced at more than $400.\nApple earned its overwhelming share of profits despite producing just 14.5 percent (48 million) of the smartphones sold in the quarter. Samsung shipped an estimated 81 million units in the same quarter, accounting for 24.5 percent of the total.\nThe average selling price of iPhones in the quarter was $670 driving 37 percent operating margins, while Samsung's ASP was just $180.\nWhile some analysts are predicting that Apple has nowhere to go but down, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook noted it the company's September earnings report that \"momentum for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus remained very strong across the quarter, and we established a new launch record for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus near the end of the quarter.\" \"We recorded the highest rate on record for Android switchers last quarter at 30 percent\" - Tim Cook\nHe added, \"we exited the quarter with demand for our new iPhones exceeding supply, but we've made good progress with our manufacturing ramp in the initial weeks of October.\"",

        "body": "The iPhone fits between the app icons.\nJust how big is that 12.9-inch iPad Pro\u2019s Retina display pixel-wise? Dennis Moore pointed out on Twitter that the gaps between app icons on the iPad Pro is actually larger than the entire width of an original iPhone or iPhone 3G screenshot. What you see above is a 1:1 comparison of the iPhone pixels overlaid on top of the iPad Pro home screen. The 2732\u00d72048 screen resolution of the iPad Pro dwarfs the 320\u00d7480 iPhone display, which was actually considered a high-resolution just five years ago.\nAdmittedly, this is only possible because Apple didn\u2019t add extra rows or columns to the Home Screen on the Pro compared to normal iPads. Many people who have iPad Pro\u2019s have complained that the view is too spacious, and would prefer more icons per line.\n[tweet https://twitter.com/dmunsie/status/664495591456641024 align=\u2019center\u2019]\nYou can actually fit over 30 original iPhone displays, in terms of pixel area, on an iPad Pro screen canvas. Obviously, in terms of actual physical size, the measurements are very different due to the massive discrepancy Retina displays have on pixel density. Below you can check out one more comparison, which fits an iPhone 3G screenshot, an iPhone 4 screenshot, an iPhone 5 screenshot and a first-generation iPad all in the same row. Funny to think that the original Mac was 512 \u00d7 342 \u2014 one app icon is bigger than that today.\nIf you are interested in a comparison of physical dimensions, then the difference is still striking. Here\u2019s the original iPhone (3.5 inch screen) versus the iPad Pro (12.9 inch screen) \u2026 you can probably fit about nine in total.\n[tweet http://twitter.com/ijustine/status/664640481440088065 align=\u2019center\u2019]",

        "title": "Dell added Thurderbolt 3 to it's entire range of XPS laptops and nobody seems to have noticed",
        "body": "Dell really put their stamp on the 2015 Ultrabook lineup this year with the Dell XPS 13 with its amazing Infinity Display. They packed a 13.3-inch display into a notebook that would normally house something closer to 11-inches, and no other manufacturer has come close to it this year. Performance was great, battery life was the new benchmark, and other than a couple of foibles such as a camera that points up at your chin, and some aggressive use of Content Adaptive Backlight Control (CABC) there was very little to complain about on the XPS 13. Today, Dell is refreshing the XPS 13 with Skylake, and trying to bring the same amazing design to the XPS 15 and the new XPS 12 2-in-1.\nXPS 13\nLet\u2019s start with the XPS 13, which should be familiar to anyone who read my review of it. Dell has tried to take the XPS 13 and push it to the next level, and they are starting with Skyake. Dell will offer Core i3-6100U all the way up to Core i7-6600U. This means the GPU will be the Intel HD 520 model, so no Iris options on the XPS 13 range unfortunately. Memory options start at 4 GB and go up to 16 GB of LPDDR3, and storage gets a bump too. The base 128 GB model is still a SATA based SSD, but the 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB models are all PCIe versions. These are evolutionary updates, but the move to Skylake has also given Dell the opportunity to add Thunderbolt 3 to the XPS 13 through a USB Type-C which also supports 10 Gbps USB, VGA, HDMI, Ethernet, and charging.\nBattery life was a pretty big part of the Broadwell based XPS 13, and on the 1080p model we got over 15 hours on our light workload. The move to Skylake looks to move that bar even further out with Dell saying the new model is rated at up to 18 hours.\nYes, it is an evolutionary update, but it is an evolutionary update of one of the best notebooks of 2015 so far.\nXPS 15\nFor those that prefer a larger notebook, the XPS 15 has been around for a while now, but when we saw it refreshed back at CES, it was still in the 2014 chassis. Today Dell has brought the look and feel of the Infinity Display to the XPS 15. They have squeezed a 15.6-inch display into the body of a 14-inch notebook. Let\u2019s talk about that display too. It is an Ultrasharp 4K Ultra HD model, which comes in at 282 pixels per inch and has a 350-nit brightness rating. The 4K model also covers 100% of the Adobe RGB color space which is a wider gamut than the typical sRGB space of most notebooks. It offers PremierColor Software as well to remap the smaller sRGB space into Adobe RGB so that colors are not portrayed incorrectly when viewing sRGB content.\nThe XPS 15 has been the model where Dell steps up the performance to a quad-core version, and despite the smaller chassis due to the Infinity Display that has not changed. The base model comes with the Intel Core i3-6100H which is a dual-core 35 Watt part, but you can also get the i5-6300HQ and i7-6700HQ which are both quad-core 45 Watt CPUs. Up to 32 GB of DDR4 is available through two SODIMM slots, and the XPS 15 offers a discrete NVIDIA GTX 960M GPU as well. You can get the XPS 15 with a spinning drive if you want (I wouldn\u2019t recommend it) or, like the XPS 13, Dell offers PCIe SSDs up to 1 TB. Dell is offering either a 56 Wh or 84 Wh battery, and the larger battery on the 1080p version of the XPS 15 is rated for up to 17 hours. For those that need faster wireless connectivity, Dell also offers a 3x3 802.11ac wireless card. Like the XPS 13, it also features Thunderbolt 3 through Type-C. One thing you do lose by moving to a 14-inch chassis is the room for a dedicated number pad.\nXPS 12\nThe final XPS model announced today is the XPS 12, which is a 2-in-1 tablet with a docking keyboard. Think of this as Dell\u2019s take on the Surface Pro, but Dell has taken a couple of different paths than Microsoft did on their 2-in-1 tablet. First, the display is a 3840x2160 UHD with a smartphone level 352 pixels per inch and 400 nits of brightness and 100% Adobe RGB. There is also a 1080p model with sRGB coverage which should help with battery life. Dell has gone with the latest Skylake version of Core m to power this tablet, with the m5-6Y54 processor which turbos up to 2.7 GHz. 8 GB of LPDDR3 memory is available, and you can get either 128 GB of 256 GB of SATA SSD storage. Keeping all of this powered is a 30 Wh battery.\nWe tested the Dell Venue 11 7000, which was similar to this in that it had a docking keyboard, but the keyboard added a lot of weight due to the extra battery inside. Dell has taken a different approach here and the keyboard base only adds just under a pound to the 1.75 lb tablet. The keyboard on the Venue 11 7000 was also not great, and the XPS 12 is offering a full size backlit keyboard with 1.3 mm of key travel, which should be a lot better. The trackpad is a glass precision trackpad.\nThe device itself is made of a magnesium alloy and covered in soft touch paint, and the display has Corning Gorilla Glass NBT.\nDell seems to have gone all-in on Thunderbolt, with this tablet featuring not one but two Type-C connectors with Thunderbolt 3. The 45 Watt A/C adapter also connects over the Type-C, and it is great to see Dell embracing this to get rid of the myriad of proprietary charging connectors that have plagued PCs for decades.\nDell XPS XPS 12 XPS 13 XPS 15 CPU Intel Core m5-6Y54 (1.1-2.7 GHz dual-core 4.5W Skylake) Intel Core i3-6100U (2.3 GHz dual-core 15W Skylake)\nIntel Core i5-6200U (2.3-2.8 GHz dual-core 15W Skylake)\n(January)Intel Core i5-6300U (2.4-3.0 GHz dual-core 15W Skylake)\nIntel Core i7-6500U (2.5-3.1 GHz dual-core 15W Skylake)\n(January)Intel Core i7-6600U (2.6-3.4 GHz dual-core 15W Skylake) Intel Core i3-6100H (2.7 GHz dual-core 35W Skylake)\nIntel Core i5-6300HQ (2.3-3.2 GHz quad-core 45W Skylake)\nIntel Core i7-6700HQ (2.6-3.5 GHz quad-core 45W Skylake) GPU Intel HD 515 Intel HD 520 Intel HD 530\nNVIDIA GTX 960M Memory 8 GB dual-channel LPDDR3-1600 4-16 GB dual-channel LPDDR3-1866 8-32 GB dual-channel DDR4-2133 Display 12.5\" 1920x1080 sRGB\n12.5\" 3840x2160 Adobe RGB 13.3\" 1920x1080 sRGB\n13.3\" 3200x1800 sRGB 15.6\" 1920x1080 sRGB\n15.6\" 3840x2160 Adobe RGB Storage 128-256 GB SATA SSD 128 GB SATA SSD, 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB PCIe SSD 500 GB - 1 GB HDD, 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB PCIe SSD Battery 30 Wh 56 Wh 56 Wh\n84 Wh Ports Thunderbolt 3 x 2 (Type-C)\nHeadset\nSD Card Reader Thunderbolt 3 x 1 (Type-C)\nUSB 3.0 x 2\nHeadset\nSD Card Reader Thunderbolt 3 x 1 (Type-C)\nUSB 3.0 x 2\nHeadset\nHDMI\nSD Card Reader Dimensions Tablet:\n291 x 193 x 8 mm\n11.46 x 7.6 x 0.31 inches\nTablet plus Keyboard:\n291 x 198 x 16-25 mm\n11.46 x 7.8 x 0.63-0.99 inches 304 x 200 x 9-15 mm\n11.98 x 7.88 x 0.33-0.6 inches 357 x 235 x 11-17 mm\n14.06 x 9.27 x 0.45-0.66 inches Weight Tablet:\n790 g\n1.75 lbs\nTablet plus Keyboard:\n1.27 kg\n2.8 lbs 1.2 - 1.29 kg\n2.7 - 2.9 lbs 1.78 - 2.0 kg\n3.9 - 4.4 lbs Price $999+ $799+ $999+\nDell was already at the forefront this year with their notebook design, so it\u2019s great to see them take that same design and apply it to the XPS 15. The XPS 12 looks to be a decent tablet with a good looking keyboard dock, and that has been one of the biggest issues with convertible tablets with attachable docks so I am excited to see this in person and give it a try. The notebooks will be available on Dell.com starting today, and the tablet will be coming in November.\nSource: Dell",

        "title": "f.lux for iOS is now available to sideload via Xcode 7+",
        "body": "f.lux is no longer available here\nNovember 12, 2015, 1PM PST\nApple has contacted us to say that the f.lux for iOS download (previously available on this page) is in violation of the Developer Program Agreement, so this method of install is no longer available.\nWe understood that the new Xcode signing was designed to allow such use, but Apple has indicated that this should not continue.\nThe demand for f.lux on mobile devices is at an all-time high:\nThis page was visited 176,000 times in its first 24 hours\nIn that time, this download was featured on Product Hunt, LifeHacker, BGR , 9to5Mac , TechCrunch, The Next Web, and many more.\nAs well, the f.lux desktop software has been downloaded more than 15M times to date\nIt is proven that screens can negatively influence sleep, and we believe that f.lux makes a significant improvement, as it mirrors very closely the research on blocking blue light before bed. But as we\u2019ve discovered, it is even difficult to conduct basic research in this area, because so many people today use mobile devices (with closed APIs) right before bed.\nSleep health is connected in the literature with obesity, diabetes, accidents, cancer, and mood disorders.\nTechnology and devices that know more about our bodies could make a major impact on health and wellness, and these are the reasons why we work on it every day.\nThis is why f.lux is free.\nf.lux cannot ship an iOS App using the Documented APIs, because the APIs we use are not there. In the last 5 years, we have had numerous conversations with Apple about our product and what would be required to make it work with iOS.\nWe respect Apple\u2019s products enormously, and we urge Apple to allow work like ours to continue through Documented APIs.\nFeedback to Apple can be written here.\nThank you for your love and support.\n\u2014Michael and Lorna\nSideloading f.lux on iOS with Xcode 7\nIn Xcode 7, you can install apps directly to your iOS device with a free account from Apple. So we decided to make a beta version of f.lux for people to try.\nIt\u2019s a few more steps than installing the app store, but there are plenty of harder things even on Pinterest. So, here\u2019s how to get f.lux installed on your iOS device.\nfor use with Xcode 7 Download f.lux for iOS\nIngredients\nMac, OSX 10.10 or greater\n1 installed version of Xcode 7\n1 Developer account (use your AppleID)\n1 Download, f.lux for iOS, unzipped\nInstructions\nFirst, mix the build ingredients together. Batter may be slightly lumpy.\nOpen the \u201ciflux.xcodeproj\u201d project in Xcode Open Xcode > Preferences > Accounts and enter your iCloud or developer credentials Under Targets > iflux > General > Identity, add a word to the end of the Bundle Identifier to make it a unique name In the same place, under Identity > Team, select your iCloud account or Developer profile\nWhile the batter chills, connect your iPhone or iPad and load the iflux build:\nFrom the Xcode Product menu, choose Destination and select your iOS device (f.lux doesn\u2019t work in a Simulator) Push Cmd-R when you\u2019re ready to have f.lux When you first run, you\u2019ll be prompted to open Settings > General > Profile on your device, and trust your developer account Run again, and allow location and notifications (things don\u2019t work so well without both of these)\nBy loading an app this way, there are no automatic updates or bug fixes, so this version does a daily update check. If one is available, a message will appear at the bottom of the app, so you can stay up to date when we make fixes.\nWe welcome your feedback - this is a beta release so please let us know if you find any issues or have feature requests. Visit our forum to discuss.\nFAQ\nQ: Why is my screen waking up?\nA: f.lux has to wake up your screen to make changes: * The best way we know to do this is to send notifications (which is why you\u2019ll see a lot of them). * If you disallow notifications (or have \u201cdo not disturb\u201d turned on), it will instead do this by asking for a device unlock, which wakes up the screen for quite a while. This is not a security risk or anything to be worried about. * If you allow notifications and make \u201cdo not disturb\u201d hours reflect your bedtime, it will be quite a bit less annoying.\nQ: Why is my screen locked at 1900K? I don\u2019t want it this dark.\nA: Because we added the bedtime mode without really finishing the UI to customize it! So if you don\u2019t like that, or if you prefer the classic/Windows sunrise/sunset, just change the wake time setting to \u201cDawn\u201d until we make a better UI. \u201cBedtime mode\u201d overall is supposed to look like a candle while you\u2019re sleeping so you can use your device in the middle of the night, if you have to.\nEnjoy!",

        "title": "Square Launches NFC Reader to Bring Apple Pay to Smaller Businesses",
        "body": "Mobile payments company Square today announced the launch of its new NFC reader within 100 small businesses around the country, letting stores who previously were unable to accept Apple Pay -- due to the lack of a required contactless reader -- begin supporting the service (via USA Today). The small square-shaped reader will act like all other Apple Pay-accepting terminals, letting users wave an iPhone or Apple Watch near the device to complete a purchase.\n\"Until now, technology like our new reader has been out of reach for local businesses,\" said Jesse Dorogusker, head of hardware at Square, told USA TODAY via email. \"Now Square sellers across the country can quickly and easily accept the new forms of payment that are crossing their counter tops.\"\nBusiness owners can buy the Square reader for $49 to begin allowing customers the option to use Apple Pay in their storefronts. With the recent surge in popularity of chip cards, touted as being a safer and more secure physical payment alternative, the reader also has the option to accept chip cards in a small slot located on the side of the device.\nSquare initially announced incoming support for Apple Pay last November, with no real hint as to what the device would be. The company then announced the Square reader during WWDC earlier this summer, confirming its NFC and chip-reading capabilities would bring the success of Apple Pay to businesses and merchants who as of yet hadn't had the chance to support the service. Merchants interested in adopting Apple Pay can visit Square's official website to reserve their own NFC reader.",

        "body": "Speaking to Independent.ie , Cook denied that the death of computers such as the Mac was imminent and said that there would be a market for such traditional personal computers for the foreseeable future.\n\u201cWe feel strongly that customers are not really looking for a converged Mac and iPad,\u201d said Cook. \u201cBecause what that would wind up doing, or what we\u2019re worried would happen, is that neither experience would be as good as the customer wants. So we want to make the best tablet in the world and the best Mac in the world. And putting those two together would not achieve either. You\u2019d begin to compromise in different ways.\u201d\nLast week, Cook appeared to suggest that PCs had outlived their usefulness.\n\u201cI think if you\u2019re looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one?\u201d he was quoted as saying in The Daily Telegraph.\nHowever, it is understood that Cook was referring to Windows PCs and not Apple ones.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t regard Macs and PCs to be the same,\u201d he said.\nCook said that both Macs and iPads have a strong future, despite large advances in power and graphics made by his company\u2019s latest iPad Pro device.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that the difference between the X86 [personal computer] and the A-series [Apple iPad architecture] is much less than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d says Cook. \u201cThat said, what we\u2019ve tried to do is to recognise that people use both iOS and Mac devices. So we\u2019ve taken certain features and made them more seamless across the devices. So with things like Handoff we just made it really simple to work on one of our products and pick it up and work on the next product.\u201d\nCook says he\u2019s \u201cbullish\u201d on reversing iPad sales declines of recent years.\nHe said that he has personally taken to the device as his principal work machine when travelling. He now travels, he said, only with an iPad Pro and an iPhone.\nSome analysts have predicted an \u2018inflection point\u2019 in the rivalry between laptops and tablets. Where tablets have been falling off in sales, newer \u2018pro\u2019 devices are being touted as a different breed.\nComputer benchmark tests suggest that Apple\u2019s new iPad Pro has faster performance and graphics than most PCs.\nMeanwhile, Cook declined to comment about any \u201cplans\u201d for an electric car that the company is reportedly making.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to announce about our plans,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s some significant changes in the automobile industry over the next several years with electrification and autonomous driving. And there\u2019s a need for a focus on user interface. And so I think there\u2019s a lot of changes that will go on there.\u201d\nSeveral reports say that Apple is planning to build a car.

        "title": "78% of Thanksgiving mobile shopping took place on iOS devices",
        "body": "Early Thanksgiving online sale reports suggest that Apple devices were once again the platform of choice for people doing their holiday shopping.\nHow dominant were Apple devices in this category? Well, according to analytics firm Custora E-Commerce Pulse, iOS devices accounted for a massive 78.3 percent of all mobile e-commerce orders in the U.S., compared to 21.5 percent for Android devices.\nConsidering the number of Android devices in circulation, those are some pretty impressive stats. To be fair to Android users (such as my long-time Cult of Android frenemy and Friday Night Fights rival Killian \u201cBig Spender\u201d Bell), Android devices have crept up slightly from where they stood last year \u2014 with Apple\u2019s share of buyers down from 79.9 percent and Android\u2019s up from 19.3 percent.\nThere are no figures yet to indicate this, but last year studies suggested that orders placed using iPhones and iPads typically come to more than those placed on Android devices, with average orders worth $118.57 on iOS, compared to $95.57 for Android. It will be interesting to see whether that gap widened or fell this year \u2014 particularly now that so many of the higher-end Android customers have jumped ship to Apple thanks to larger-screen iPhones.\nOverall, Thanksgiving online shopping revenue was up 12.5 percent year over year in 2015, while average order value was up by 1.5 percent. Black Friday sales estimates are looking good, too \u2014 being up by over 9.4 percent versus last year\u2019s Black Friday event (as of 8.30am EST).\nSource: Custora",

        "title": "Apple Pencil torn apart to find incredibly small logic board, folded in half to maximize space",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nVia iFixit.\nThe new Apple Pencil for iPad Pro packs a great deal of advanced technology into a tiny package, including a logic board that's actually folded in half to fit inside the writing tool.\nIn dissecting the new Apple Pencil, iFixit discovered what it called the smallest logic board the solutions provider has ever seen. The Pencil's logic board weighs in at just 1 gram, and features an ARM-based CPU, Bluetooth Smart radio, and more.\nAccessing the innards of the Apple Pencil wasn't easy \u2014 the repair experts were forced to cut the device's plastic casing into two parts, after they couldn't find an obvious point of entry to its internal components.\nThe plastic shell also houses a tube-shaped lithium-ion battery, rated at 3.82 volts and 0.329Wh. That's just 5 percent the charge of an iPhone 6s, though the Apple Pencil is rated for 12 hours of battery life, while 15 seconds of charging provides 30 minutes of uptime.\nApple Pencil logic board and battery, via iFixit.\niFixit also found that the Pencil's pressure sensor features a tiny board with a series of moving ticks, which are believed to help sense pressure when users press the stylus tip down onto the iPad Pro. The Pencil nib also has a tiny bit of metal that's suspected to aid in determining angle and orientation.\nIn what has seemingly become par for the course in Apple product teardowns, iFixit has given the Pencil a \"repairability score\" of 1 out of 10. Though the nib and cap can be replaced if lost, the rest of the device is not meant to be repaired, and the Pencil will be thrown away or recycled if and when its integrated battery can no longer hold a charge.\nApple Pencil logic board unfolded, via iFixit.\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities indicated earlier this week that production of the Apple Pencil is extremely complicated, and assembly is not going as smoothly as Apple and its manufacturing partners had hoped. Kuo expects Pencil yields to improve as producers overcome inefficiencies associated with building a new format device.",

        "body": "Following the launch of Apple Music on Android earlier this week, Apple today has revealed that it is officially shutting down the Beats Music service on November 30th. According to a support document shared on the Beats Music website, all subscriptions will be cancelled on that date, with users being asked to migrate to Apple Music.\nIn the support document, Apple, of course, touts that all of the features Beats Music users have grown accustomed to are present on Apple Music. Apple also points out all of the new features of its service, including Beats 1 and \u201ceven better recommendations.\u201d\nThe full support document reads as follows:\nBeats Music ends on November 30. Your subscription will be cancelled, but you can move your picks and preferences over to Apple Music right now. All the pros that curated music for you are still crafting more amazing experiences. Plus, on Apple Music, you\u2019ll get even better recommendations based on music you already listen to and love, 24/7 global radio with Beats 1, exciting material from your favorite artist, and more.\nBeats Music stopped accepting new subscribers for Beats Music back in June when Apple Music launched on iOS. The Beats Music iOS app was updated then as well to support easy migration to Apple Music. Following the launch of Apple Music on Android earlier this week, there is seemingly no reason for Apple to keep Beats Music alive any longer.\nBeats Music users have until November 30th to enjoy their memberships before they will be canceled.\n[tweet https://twitter.com/apollozac/status/664198679159549957 align=\u2019center\u2019]",

        "body": "Rajiv Kumar, a pediatric endocrinologist, can track Blake Atkins' blood-sugar readings with the help of technology that transmits the information to the teen's electronic medical record. Credit: Norbert von der Groeben\nLori Atkins' 16-year-old son, Blake, has Type 1 diabetes, and she used to track his blood-sugar readings by hand.\nIt was time-intensive and sometimes daunting, like the night he had a cold and \"his numbers were going crazy.\" Lori paged Blake's doctor and sat at a computer, where she wrote a detailed email listing her son's glucose measurements over the preceding 12 hours to ensure the physician had all the vital data.\nNow, however, Blake's glucose readings are available at his doctor's fingertips.\nRajiv Kumar, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist at Stanford Children's Health and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, can access the teenager's blood-sugar readings quickly, without his mom having to crunch numbers or schedule a clinic appointment. And it's all because of a new health-care platform from Apple.\nIn September 2014, the company released Apple HealthKit, a technology that can securely share patient-generated data with third-party applications, including Epic MyChart, the electronic medical record and patient portal system used by Stanford Children's Health.\nPilot program\nKumar began piloting HealthKit in March with 10 patients, including Blake, to assess its ability to track blood-sugar levels. Kumar is so pleased with the results that he is now planning to offer the program to more of his patients who use a continuous glucose monitor.\n\"We're very excited about this experience,\" he said. \"Our endocrinologists are now able to easily assess large volumes of blood-sugar data between clinic visits\u2014and quickly identify trends that could benefit from insulin dosing regimen changes.\"\n\"There is also an added benefit,\" said Kumar, who is a clinical assistant professor of pediatric endocrinology and diabetes at the School of Medicine. \"We no longer need to download the data during clinic visits, and this allows us to spend more time with our patients and their parents.\"\nHow does it work? Patients like Blake wear a continuous glucose monitor that sends 288 blood-sugar readings a day to an Apple mobile device through Bluetooth. The data is securely transmitted via HealthKit into the patient's electronic medical record at Stanford Children's Health through the MyChart app.\nThe work is an example of Stanford Medicine's focus on precision health by generating care that is proactive, predictive and personalized.\nBlake was diagnosed with diabetes four years ago, and he said that using a monitor linked to his iPhone has been a game changer.\nIn the past, he and his mother tried to be diligent about communicating his glucose measurements and assessing insulin dose needs\u2014a necessity for treating the disease. But this wasn't easy for Blake, who has school, homework, soccer practice and myriad activities that keep him busy. That left most of the onus on Lori.\n'It's taken the pressure off'\nNow, if she or Blake has questions or concerns about trends in his glucose readings, they can simply send a message to Kumar through MyChart. The readings will have been uploaded already to Blake's electronic medical record and be ready for Kumar to examine.\n\"I love it,\" said Lori.\nAnd for Blake, no additional effort is required.\n\"It's not a hassle at all,\" he said, adding that other than changing out the filament sensor for his continuous glucose monitor once a week, he doesn't have to track anything because HealthKit does it for him. \"It's taken the pressure off.\"\nHaving easy and timely access to Blake's cumulative data helps Kumar see the big picture. \"By being able to look at a block of time, I'm able to detect patterns and pinpoint trends,\" said Kumar, who sees patients at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital and other Stanford Children's Health locations, including California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco and John Muir Health in Walnut Creek, California. \"I'm also learning more than I would from a routine, three-month patient visit. It's just a much more streamlined system.\"",

        "body": "Apple is in talks with U.S. banks over a potential person-to-person mobile payments service, reports The Wall Street Journal. Such a service would perhaps be positioned as an expansion to Apple Pay, and it would allow people to send each other payments, much like PayPal's Venmo or Square's Square Cash service.\nLittle is known about the talks at this early date, but The Wall Street Journal says communication between Apple and the banks is ongoing and it's not known if Apple has inked any concrete deals. Apple is said to be speaking to Chase, Capital One, Wells Fargo, and U.S. Bank, but key details \"remain in flux\" and the technical details still need to be worked out.\nIt isn't clear how Apple intends to make money from the service. Indeed, the company may view a person-to-person offering mostly as a way to get more consumers to convert to its phones. Under the current discussions, Apple wouldn\u2019t charge the banks for participating in its person-to-person payment service, said the person familiar with the talks. That is different from Apple Pay in which the banks pay Apple for each transaction\nPerson-to-person services like Venmo and Square Cash are used for personal payments and are useful for things like paying back a friend who bought dinner or splitting a rent payment. With Apple's system, iPhone and iPad owners could perhaps use Apple Pay to send secure payments to one another from a checking account.\nA launch date for the service is unclear as of yet, but Apple may be targeting a 2016 debut.",

Read our ethics policy\nApple iPhone 7 concept by Yasser Farahi.\nApple's next-generation plus-sized iPhone model will feature even more RAM, reaching 3 gigabytes in total embedded into a next-generation \"A10\" processor, according to well-connected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nKuo's latest details from Apple suppliers were published in a research note Tuesday evening with KGI Securities, a copy of which was obtained by AppleInsider. In it, he revealed that while the 4.7-inch \"iPhone 7\" is expected to have the same 2 gigabytes of RAM as the iPhone 6s, the larger \"iPhone 7 Plus\" will add another gigabyte for even greater performance.\nDespite the anticipated RAM difference, both phones are expected to run a next-generation mobile processor architecture from Apple, likely to be known as the \"A10\" CPU.\nThe iPhone 6 Plus features 1GB of RAM, while the iPhone 6s Plus doubles that to 2GB, but Apple is expected to add yet another gigabyte of memory to next year's 'iPhone 7 Plus'\nTo date, the main differentiating factor for the 5.5-inch \"Plus\" models, aside from screen size, has been improved cameras. Specifically, both the iPhone 6 Plus and the iPhone 6s Plus have exclusively boasted hardware optical image stabilization capabilities, which are not found in their smaller 4.7-inch counterparts.\nIt's likely that a new \"iPhone 7\" will debut in September of 2016, sticking with Apple's usual annual release pattern. It's also expected that Apple will introduce a revamped external design for next year's handset, though Kuo did not shed any details on those changes in Tuesday's report.\nHowever, he previously revealed in September that the \"iPhone 7\" is on track to be Apple's thinnest iPhone yet, with the company said to be aiming to make the 2016 upgrade as thin as 6 millimeters. That would be even thinner than the latest iPod touch and iPad Air 2.\nKuo has an extremely strong track record in predicting Apple's future product plans. In particular, he correctly predicted all of the company's fall 2015 product updates, including a slightly thicker iPhone 6s with Series 7000 aluminum and Force Touch input, as well as a larger iPad Pro with pressure-sensitive stylus.",

        "title": "f.lux for iOS not available to download any longer as it violates the Developer Program Agreement",
        "body": "f.lux is no longer available here\nNovember 12, 2015, 1PM PST\nApple has contacted us to say that the f.lux for iOS download (previously available on this page) is in violation of the Developer Program Agreement, so this method of install is no longer available.\nWe understood that the new Xcode signing was designed to allow such use, but Apple has indicated that this should not continue.\nThe demand for f.lux on mobile devices is at an all-time high:\nThis page was visited 176,000 times in its first 24 hours\nIn that time, this download was featured on Product Hunt, LifeHacker, BGR , 9to5Mac , TechCrunch, The Next Web, and many more.\nAs well, the f.lux desktop software has been downloaded more than 15M times to date\nIt is proven that screens can negatively influence sleep, and we believe that f.lux makes a significant improvement, as it mirrors very closely the research on blocking blue light before bed. But as we\u2019ve discovered, it is even difficult to conduct basic research in this area, because so many people today use mobile devices (with closed APIs) right before bed.\nSleep health is connected in the literature with obesity, diabetes, accidents, cancer, and mood disorders.\nTechnology and devices that know more about our bodies could make a major impact on health and wellness, and these are the reasons why we work on it every day.\nThis is why f.lux is free.\nf.lux cannot ship an iOS App using the Documented APIs, because the APIs we use are not there. In the last 5 years, we have had numerous conversations with Apple about our product and what would be required to make it work with iOS.\nWe respect Apple\u2019s products enormously, and we urge Apple to allow work like ours to continue through Documented APIs.\nFeedback to Apple can be written here.\nThank you for your love and support.\n\u2014Michael and Lorna\nSideloading f.lux on iOS with Xcode 7\nIn Xcode 7, you can install apps directly to your iOS device with a free account from Apple. So we decided to make a beta version of f.lux for people to try.\nIt\u2019s a few more steps than installing the app store, but there are plenty of harder things even on Pinterest. So, here\u2019s how to get f.lux installed on your iOS device.\nfor use with Xcode 7 Download f.lux for iOS\nIngredients\nMac, OSX 10.10 or greater\n1 installed version of Xcode 7\n1 Developer account (use your AppleID)\n1 Download, f.lux for iOS, unzipped\nInstructions\nFirst, mix the build ingredients together. Batter may be slightly lumpy.\nOpen the \u201ciflux.xcodeproj\u201d project in Xcode Open Xcode > Preferences > Accounts and enter your iCloud or developer credentials Under Targets > iflux > General > Identity, add a word to the end of the Bundle Identifier to make it a unique name In the same place, under Identity > Team, select your iCloud account or Developer profile\nWhile the batter chills, connect your iPhone or iPad and load the iflux build:\nFrom the Xcode Product menu, choose Destination and select your iOS device (f.lux doesn\u2019t work in a Simulator) Push Cmd-R when you\u2019re ready to have f.lux When you first run, you\u2019ll be prompted to open Settings > General > Profile on your device, and trust your developer account Run again, and allow location and notifications (things don\u2019t work so well without both of these)\nBy loading an app this way, there are no automatic updates or bug fixes, so this version does a daily update check. If one is available, a message will appear at the bottom of the app, so you can stay up to date when we make fixes.\nWe welcome your feedback - this is a beta release so please let us know if you find any issues or have feature requests. Visit our forum to discuss.\nFAQ\nQ: Why is my screen waking up?\nA: f.lux has to wake up your screen to make changes: * The best way we know to do this is to send notifications (which is why you\u2019ll see a lot of them). * If you disallow notifications (or have \u201cdo not disturb\u201d turned on), it will instead do this by asking for a device unlock, which wakes up the screen for quite a while. This is not a security risk or anything to be worried about. * If you allow notifications and make \u201cdo not disturb\u201d hours reflect your bedtime, it will be quite a bit less annoying.\nQ: Why is my screen locked at 1900K? I don\u2019t want it this dark.\nA: Because we added the bedtime mode without really finishing the UI to customize it! So if you don\u2019t like that, or if you prefer the classic/Windows sunrise/sunset, just change the wake time setting to \u201cDawn\u201d until we make a better UI. \u201cBedtime mode\u201d overall is supposed to look like a candle while you\u2019re sleeping so you can use your device in the middle of the night, if you have to.\nEnjoy!",

        "title": "Rumor claims new electric car maker Faraday Future is front for Apple",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nA mysterious electric car maker called Faraday Future \u2014 backed by large resources \u2014 could be a front for Apple, a report speculated on Friday.\nThe company only began operating out of a former Nissan research facility in California last year, but already has over 400 workers, and is aiming to have 500 by the end of 2015, news.com.au said. Some of the staff include the head designer of the BMW i8, a SpaceX battery specialist, and a former interior designer for Ferrari. Others have resumes with employers like Facebook, Google, Ford, General Motors, and Volvo.\nUnusually, Faraday has refused to disclose the name of its CEO. Its de facto spokesman has been Nick Sampson, a senior VP who previously served as the director of vehicle and chassis engineering for Tesla.\nThe company is planning to spend $1 billion on a manufacturing plant in California, Nevada, Georgia, or Louisiana, and on top of selling cars the company has claimed it \"plans to explore other aspects of the automotive and technology industries, including unique ownership and usage models, in-vehicle content and autonomous driving.\"\nIts first vehicle is slated for 2017 and will allegedly have a battery with 15 percent more range than the Tesla Model S 85kW-hr, or about 310 miles. Other than that, only a concept render of the vehicle has been produced.\nFaraday has so far refused to say where its vast cash resources have come from. \"We are keeping our partners confidential,\" the company told the Wall Street Journal.\nThe fact that Faraday has already teased a car may count against an Apple connection, but the kinds of hires the company has picked up are consistent with those attributed to Apple's electric car project. Apple has expressed a particular interest in BMW's i-series vehicles.",

        "body": "Today Apple announced Self Service Repair will be available June 21 for the iPhone 14 lineup and additional Mac models, including the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro powered by M2. Since April 2022, Self Service Repair has given anyone with experience repairing electronic devices access to the same manuals, genuine Apple parts, and tools used at Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Service Providers.\nApple will also make the System Configuration process used for iPhone repairs, such as displays, batteries, and cameras, even easier to use. System Configuration is a postrepair software tool that ensures repairs with genuine Apple parts \u2014 designed and tested to internationally recognized standards \u2014 were completed correctly, and the parts are working properly. The tool is available for free to all Self Service Repair users and participating service providers in Apple repair programs.\nRunning System Configuration after a repair authenticates genuine Apple parts, updates firmware, and calibrates parts to ensure maximum performance and quality. Additionally, for repairs involving biometric authentication, such as Touch ID or Face ID, System Configuration links the biometric sensors to the Secure Enclave on the logic board to ensure device security and customer privacy.\nSelf Service Repair users can now initiate System Configuration by placing their devices into Diagnostics mode and following onscreen prompts. Users no longer need to contact the Self Service Repair support team to run the final step of a repair, but the team will still be available to assist as needed.\nSelf Service Repair will also be available for the True Depth camera and top speaker for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups \u2014 as well as Mac desktops with M1 \u2014 in the U.S., Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the U.K.\nSelf Service Repair is part of Apple\u2019s efforts to expand access to repairs. Widespread repair access plays an important role in extending products\u2019 longevity, which is good for users and good for the planet. For the vast majority of users who do not have experience repairing electronic devices, visiting a professional authorized repair provider with certified technicians who use genuine Apple parts is the safest and most reliable way to get a repair.\nOver the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training, including more than 4,500 Independent Repair Providers. A global network of more than 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers supports more than 100,000 active technicians.",

The compatibility means the iPad Pro is capable of transferring files at speeds that reach 5Gbps, whereas a USB 2.0 connection can only reach a max speed of 480Mbps. Apple had a good reason for not making a big deal out of it, though: you'll need to get an extra USB 3.0 adapter to be able to take advantage of the capability, since the tablet only ships with a cable that can handle USB 2.0 speeds. Problem is, that adapter doesn't exist yet, so you'll have to deal with slower file transfers for a while longer.",

Over the years, I\u2019ve gathered a collection of these things \u2014 they\u2019re like gold.\nThe best part is that the same bits work with all your devices, so it makes traveling (or moving country) a lot easier.\nWhat\u2019s sad, though, is that this awesome invention seems to be slowly going away as Apple creates new chargers for its devices. The latest iPhone comes with a moulded charging adaptor that can\u2019t be swapped, as does the most recent batch of iPads.\nThe good news is that you can still buy these if you want to.
