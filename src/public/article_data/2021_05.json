        "body": "Cupertino, California Apple today announced Apple Music is bringing industry-leading sound quality to subscribers with the addition of Spatial Audio with support for Dolby Atmos. Spatial Audio gives artists the opportunity to create immersive audio experiences for their fans with true multidimensional sound and clarity. Apple Music subscribers will also be able to listen to more than 75 million songs in Lossless Audio \u2014 the way the artists created them in the studio. These new features will be available for Apple Music subscribers starting next month at no additional cost.\n\u201cApple Music is making its biggest advancement ever in sound quality,\u201d said Oliver Schusser, Apple\u2019s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. \u201cListening to a song in Dolby Atmos is like magic. The music comes from all around you and sounds incredible. Now we are bringing this truly innovative and immersive experience to our listeners with music from their favorite artists like J Balvin, Gustavo Dudamel, Ariana Grande, Maroon 5, Kacey Musgraves, The Weeknd, and so many more. Subscribers will also be able to listen to their music in the highest audio quality with Lossless Audio. Apple Music as we know it is about to change forever.\u201d\nSpatial Audio with Support for Dolby Atmos\nApple is bringing Spatial Audio with support for Dolby Atmos to Apple Music. Dolby Atmos is a revolutionary, immersive audio experience that enables artists to mix music so the sound comes from all around and from above. By default, Apple Music will automatically play Dolby Atmos tracks on all AirPods and Beats headphones with an H1 or W1 chip, as well as the built-in speakers in the latest versions of iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple Music will be adding new Dolby Atmos tracks constantly and will be curating a special set of Dolby Atmos playlists to help listeners find the music they love. In addition, albums that are available in Dolby Atmos will have a badge on the detail page for easy discovery.\nAt launch, subscribers can enjoy thousands of songs in Spatial Audio from some of the world\u2019s biggest artists and music across all genres, including hip-hop, country, Latin, pop, and classical. Apple Music is working with artists and labels to add new releases and the best catalog tracks, as more artists begin to create music specifically for the Spatial Audio experience. Together, Apple Music and Dolby are making it easy for musicians, producers, and mix engineers to create songs in Dolby Atmos. Initiatives include doubling the number of Dolby-enabled studios in major markets, offering educational programs, and providing resources to independent artists.\n\u201cToday marks the introduction of Dolby Atmos on Apple Music \u2014 a new music experience that is transforming how music is created by artists and enjoyed by their fans,\u201d said Kevin Yeaman, Dolby Laboratories\u2019 president and CEO. \u201cWe are working with Apple Music to make Dolby Atmos widely available to all musicians and anyone who loves music.\u201d\nJ Balvin said: \u201cI\u2019m really excited to be part of this project with Apple Music because I always want to be a step ahead and I think this is one of those steps. With Lossless, everything in the music is going to sound bigger and stronger but more importantly, it will be better quality. Hearing myself and my music in Dolby Atmos for the first time, it was just crazy, it blew my mind, it\u2019s indescribable. I think fans will really love this new experience.\u201d\nGustavo Dudamel said: \u201cThere are no words to describe the immersive, overpowering experience of being a conductor, leading a performance of Mahler\u2019s towering \u2018Symphony of a Thousand.\u2019 But now, technology is advancing to bring that experience closer to our ears, our minds, and our souls. Share with me this monumental, live performance with my beloved Los Angeles Philharmonic, remastered in Dolby Atmos audio technology for the first time on Apple Music alongside my collection of Deutsche Grammophon recordings with the LA Phil, in rich, remarkable 3D sound.\u201d\nGrammy Award-winning producer, songwriter, and composer Giles Martin said: \u201cSince recording began, artists, producers, and engineers have tried to paint pictures with sound, transporting listeners to worlds they never knew existed, even when the sound came from a single speaker. Now with the dawn of immersive audio, we can take the music lover inside the music. From the feeling of hearing your favorite artist in the same room as you, to the experience of sitting directly in the middle of a symphony orchestra, the listening experience is transformative and the possibilities for the creator are endless. This is a quantum leap in technology \u2013 I have so far had the pleasure of mixing some of the greatest artists in history in Dolby Atmos. With this work I have found myself falling into albums I love. There is a unique experience of being able to fully immerse myself in music that, although is familiar, suddenly sounds new, fresh, and immediate. As a creator, it is beyond exciting that we can now share this incredible experience through Apple Music.\u201d\nGrammy Award-winning mixing engineer Manny Marroquin said: \u201cSpatial Audio gives music a new identity. Every time I mix in Atmos it gives me goosebumps. The future has arrived.\u201d\nLossless Audio\nApple Music will also make its catalog of more than 75 million songs available in Lossless Audio. Apple uses ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) to preserve every single bit of the original audio file. This means Apple Music subscribers will be able to hear the exact same thing that the artists created in the studio.\nTo start listening to Lossless Audio, subscribers using the latest version of Apple Music can turn it on in Settings > Music > Audio Quality. Here, they can choose different resolutions for different connections such as cellular, Wi-Fi, or for download. Apple Music\u2019s Lossless tier starts at CD quality, which is 16 bit at 44.1 kHz (kilohertz), and goes up to 24 bit at 48 kHz and is playable natively on Apple devices. For the true audiophile, Apple Music also offers Hi-Resolution Lossless all the way up to 24 bit at 192 kHz.1\nMastering Engineer Piper Payne said: \u201cThe soul and life of the mix is sitting in the extra bits of data that are stored in the lossless file. As a mastering engineer, having the ability to convey the music to the listener at its highest quality is the end goal of what I work for every day.\u201d",

        "body": "WhatsApp breaks App Store guidelines by limiting functionality for users who do not accept new privacy policy\n11th May, 2021 at 5:38 pm by June\nThis story is 95% reliable. 6 min read Comments\nFacebook\u2019s WhatsApp has announced that users that don\u2019t accept a new set of terms and conditions will be barred from certain features of the messaging app.\nThis move goes against Apple\u2019s App Store policies, which explicitly state that such behavior is strictly prohibited.\nIf WhatsApp implements the announced changes, the app could be removed from the App Store.\nWhatsApp\u2019s controversial new privacy policy, which goes into effect on May 15th, 2021, will limit functionality on the app \u2014 such as the access to the contact/chat list and the primary screen of the app if users do not accept the privacy policy. If the user continues to refuse accepting, they will eventually lose access to calls, and will no longer receive notifications, rendering the app practically useless.\nQuoting the App Store guideline 3.2.2 (vi):\nApps should allow a user to get what they\u2019ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc. Apps should not require users to rate the app, review the app, watch videos, download other apps, tap on advertisements, enable tracking, or take other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, use the app, or receive monetary or other compensation, including but not limited to gift cards and codes.\nTherefore, WhatsApp\u2019s actions are not allowed under the App Store guidelines, which could result in the removal of the app from the App Store, or termination of their developer account, according to Apple\u2019s policies.\nWhatsApp\u2019s new privacy policy allows the company to share data such as your phone number and transaction data from WhatsApp business chats to its parent company, Facebook. This does not, however, mean WhatsApp or Facebook can view or edit your messages on the app as all conversations are still end-to-end encrypted. From Economic Times:\nThe U.S. government, which had written to WhatsApp last month to withdraw the proposed changes to its privacy rules and had sought clarifications on a set of queries from it, told the court that the companies can't share data of users which must be protected. WhatsApp and Facebook refuted allegations of data sharing.\nMillions of WhatsApp users have flocked to competing chat services like Signal and Telegram after the company announced these changes to their privacy policy.\nWe have reached out to Apple Developer Relations about this, and will update this article if we receive a response from the company.",

        "title": "Facebook pays for study that says Apple's iOS 14 privacy changes are bad",
        "body": "What you need to know\nFacebook has paid for a paper researching Apple's iOS 14 privacy and tracking transparency measures.\nThe paper says that Apple's changes are anti-competitive and designed only to benefit Apple.\nIt also says the new moves harm everyone else, but users are voting in droves to opt-out of tracking.\nFacebook has funded a paper on Apple's new iOS 14 App Tracking Transparency changes which states they are designed to only benefit Apple.\nThe paper's abstract states:\nApple's iOS 14 update represents an anti-competitive strategy disguised as a privacy-protecting measure. Apple now prohibits non-Apple apps from using information essential to providing relevant, personalized advertising, without explicit user opt-in. And users may opt-in only after they are shown an ominous and misleading prompt about \"tracking,\" one that Apple's own apps and services need not display, because consumers are automatically \"opted in\" to Apple's own tracking. Apple's policy will have the pernicious effects of enhancing the dominance of iOS among mobile operating systems and the dominance of its own apps and services within the iOS ecosystem, while reducing consumer choice and devastating the free-app ecosystem.\nThe paper is a scathing denunciation of Apple's iOS 14 changes, a blanket condemnation of the policy that seems almost irrefutable. Except that on the first page a small footnote states:\nHuber C. Hurst Eminent Scholar Chair in Law and Professor, University of Florida Levin College of Law and Piramal Associate Professor of Business Administration, HBS. We gratefully acknowledge support from Facebook, Inc. in funding this analysis. The views expressed here are solely our own.\nFacebook has been an ardent critic of Apple's changes, stating they will harm small businesses and advertising revenue on its platform, sentiments echoed in the report. Research conducted by iMore in April reveals that only 2% of iOS users plan to allow apps to track them now that the new opt-in feature is available, suggesting the vast majority of users support having more control over their privacy.

        "body": "Only 4% of iOS users in US are opting in to ad tracking, report says\nIf you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nAn ongoing analysis of Apple's App Tracking Transparency tool claims 96% of users in the U.S. are opting out of the ad tracking feature which launched in April.\nAccording to Flurry Analytics, which has been tracking daily opt-in and opt-out rates following the launch of iOS 14.5 late last month, roughly 4% of daily users in the U.S. are allowing apps access to their Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) tag. The figure is based on a sampling of 2.5 million daily mobile active users.\nRates increase when taking other countries into account, with some 11% of 5.3 million daily users opting in to ad tracking worldwide.\nDaily rates are calculated by dividing the number of devices that opted in by the total number of devices that both opted in and out using ATT.\nInterestingly, Flurry's data suggests people are actively opting out of tracking requests. The company found only 4% of iOS 14.5 users have the \"Allow Apps to Request to Track\" option in settings disabled. That figure drops to 2% in the U.S. Turning the \"Allow Apps to Request to Track\" selection off automatically restricts IDFA data access and precludes apps from asking permission track.\nIntegrated into the latest iOS, iPadOS and tvOS revisions, ATT is a new feature that requires developers to ask users before tracking their movement across other apps and the web. Touted by Apple as an important user privacy tool, critics say the requirement to obtain ad tracking permissions will dissuade users from participating and thus hurt businesses reliant on ad revenue.\nApple offers a set of secure ad attribution tools as a privacy-focused replacement to industry standard tracking methods. The systems, including the SKAdNetwork and Privacy Click Measurement, do not directly identify users and can therefore be integrated without express user permission.",

Advertising company Blis said that the cost of adverts had dropped by 11pc in cases where users had blocked companies from tracking their activity across different apps.\nThe report says the downturn has been \"more pronounced\" in some countries, apparently in the UK the average cost of adverts has fallen by 36%, saying a sustained decline \"would knock billions off\" the industry.\nApple introduced iOS 14.5 to the public in April, allowing users to opt-in or out of tracking across multiple apps and websites by companies using an IDFA identifier.\nResearch conducted by iMore in April suggests that only 2% of iOS users will select the 'allow' option when it comes to tracking. Some (22%) it would depend on which app was asking the question, but a staggering 71.6% of users said they would be opting out of tracking.\nFacebook has been a vocal critic of the move stating it will harm small businesses that rely on advertising to reach customers.\nA new report says that Apple may be upping the ante on its own advertising services used on the App Store, where developers can pay to have their apps advertised in the search tab on the App Store.",

        "body": "It seems that in the United States, at least, app developers and advertisers who rely on targeted mobile advertising for revenue are seeing their worst fears realized: Analytics data published this week suggests that US users choose to opt out of tracking 96 percent of the time in the wake of iOS 14.5.\nWhen Apple released iOS 14.5 late last month, it began enforcing a policy called App Tracking Transparency. iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV apps are now required to request users' permission to use techniques like IDFA (ID for Advertisers) to track those users' activity across multiple apps for data collection and ad targeting purposes.\nThe change met fierce resistance from companies like Facebook, whose market advantages and revenue streams are built on leveraging users' data to target the most effective ads at those users. Facebook went so far as to take out full-page newspaper ads claiming that the change would not just hurt Facebook but would destroy small businesses around the world. Shortly after, Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a data privacy conference and delivered a speech that harshly criticized Facebook's business model.\nAdvertisement\nNonetheless, Facebook and others have complied with Apple's new rule to avoid being rejected from the iPhone's App Store, though some apps present a screen explaining why users should opt in before the Apple-mandated prompt to opt in or out appears.\nThis new data comes from Verizon-owned Flurry Analytics, which claims to be used in more than one million mobile apps. Flurry says it will update the data daily so followers can see the trend as it progresses.\nBased on the data from those one million apps, Flurry Analytics says US users agree to be tracked only four percent of the time. The global number is significantly higher at 12 percent, but that's still below some advertising companies' estimates.\nThe data from Flurry Analytics shows users rejecting tracking at much higher rates than were predicted by surveys that were conducted before iOS 14.5 went live. One of those surveys found that just shy of 40 percent, not 4 percent, would opt in to tracking when prompted.\nFlurry Analytics' data doesn't break things down by app, though, so it's impossible to know from this data whether the numbers are skewed against app tracking opt-in by, say, users' distrust of Facebook. It's possible users are being more trusting of some types of apps than others, but that data is not available.\nListing image by Bloomberg | Getty Images",

        "title": "How Apple screwed Facebook Apple\u2019s iOS 14.5 update has triggered an unstoppable collapse in Facebook\u2019s ability to collect user data",
        "body": "It is not unusual for the bosses of Apple and Facebook to be at loggerheads with each other over privacy. Back in 2018 Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg accused his Apple counterpart Tim Cook of being \u201cextremely glib\u201d for making scathing remarks about Facebook\u2019s involvement in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Weeks later Apple introduced privacy controls that hampered Facebook\u2019s ability to collect user data via Apple devices.\nThings moved up a notch at the end of last year after Apple revealed that app-tracking transparency would be installed as part of its latest system update. Until iOS 14.5 came along, apps like Facebook could automatically track what people were looking at on their phones and sell targeted ad space accordingly. The update was designed so users were asked their permission for the tracking to happen first.\nFacebook responded to the move by taking out full-page ads in the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal accusing Apple of posing a threat to the \u201c10 million businesses [who] use our advertising tools each month to find new customers, hire employees and engage with their communities\u201d. Cook retaliated by tweeting that users \u201cshould have the choice over the data that is being collected about them and how it\u2019s used\u201d.\nIt may have looked like little more than a war of words between two rivals, but Facebook \u2013 which warned of the \u201cheadwind\u201d posed by iOS 14.5 in its 2020 accounts \u2013 was right to be concerned. Since the update went live last month iPhone owners have been opting out of data tracking in their droves. According to Flurry Analytics, 85 per cent of worldwide users clicked \u2018ask app not to track\u2019 when prompted, with the proportion rising to 94 per cent in the US. Apple did not respond to requests to comment.\nFor an organisation like Facebook, whose entire business model is based around collecting, analysing, selling on and profiting from data about its users\u2019 likes and dislikes, such numbers could be devastating.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge blow for Facebook,\u201d says Jake Moore, cybersecurity specialist at ESET UK. \u201cThey have major issues when another huge tech firm such as Apple comes along and says privacy is important. When Apple is asking users not to track \u2013 and that language is important \u2013 if anything it\u2019s sticking a couple of fingers up at Facebook.\u201d",

        "body": "Such a good idea. Image: Getty Images\nOn certain days, I dream.\nI dream that all viruses will disappear, all people will learn to dance and at least some tech companies will embrace (relative) honesty as a guiding light.\nToday isn't one of those days, as I must contemplate Facebook, the ill-shaped birthmark on tech's barely hirsute visage.\nShould you have recently been living in a Redwood tree, you may not know that Apple has forced apps to display a notice asking you whether you want the app to track you all over the web until the end of time.\nFacebook is unhappy about this because it makes money by tracking you all over the web until the end of time. (And, I'm sure it hopes, beyond.)\nSo, as noticed by former Obama White House senior adviser Ashkan Soltani, Facebook is attempting to frighten its users -- both on the iOS Facebook app and the iOS Instagram app.\nIt's placed its own little notice intended to finesse iOS types into consenting to tracking. The notice leans on users' vast enthusiasm for more personalized advertising. It offers the hoary reasoning about tracking being performed to mainly help small businesses.\nBut there's a third joyous nugget: \"Help keep Facebook free of charge.\" The same threat is offered to Instagram users.\nMany may admire the chill-hearted cynicism.\nFacebook appears willing to try any ruse it can to get more iOS users to let tracking continue. Because, some may imagine, Facebook is afraid it might get kicked in the profits.\nAnd I, for one, begin to dream.\nHow much more honest a relationship it might be if Facebook charged for its wares.\nFacebook would be clear about what sort of business it was.\nUsers would become customers. They'd be buying the product instead of being the product.\nThey'd be in a position to expect service, as opposed to the automated wasteland that is Facebook's cursory nod to responding to user concerns.\nThey might even be able to work out how Facebook's privacy controls really work and demand even greater simplicity -- not unlike the very clear pop-up Apple is offering app users.\nI've just woken up again.\nThat dream was short and is now over.\nFacebook will no more charge for its service than it will stop its site from being used as a prop for various dubious governments.\nMark Zuckerberg is onto a very good thing and has been for years.\nHe's just like the American owners of the most famous English soccer clubs. It's not that he's worried about making money, it's that he's worried about making enough money to suit his egotistical designs.\nYes, he's worried about people not only caring about privacy but being offered simple ways to do something about it. Ultimately, however, it's the money that moves at Facebook.\nWhen someone threatens in such a brazen manner, believe what they say. I do.\nJust as I believe Zuckerberg has his own way of preserving his privacy: wear an unreasonably comic amount of sunscreen.",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s new iPad Pro is amazing, but iPadOS holds it back from its true potential",
        "body": "The term itself makes me cringe, but I fit the description of a \"digital nomad\" \u2014 someone who makes a living working online from various locations \u2014 to a tee. Well, I did anyway, until COVID-19 killed travel for most of the world. But before COVID-19 though, I was traveling out of my Hong Kong base at least once a month, and I\u2019d work from random coffee shops around the world. And like any tech enthusiast, I'm always looking to upgrade my gear -- in this case, I wanted my portable work machine to be smaller, lighter, even more portable.\nThis explains why I have such a fondness for great foldables. I dream of a future in which the phone in my pocket can fully double as my large screen work machine too. But foldables aren't quite there yet, so for now, the only logical product that'd be considered more portable than a laptop is a tablet. That's exactly the marketing angle Apple has used to sell iPads too -- that the iPad, especially the Pro model, can replace the computer.\nBut the iPad Pro is also not quite there as a full time work machine for many people. The problem isn't hardware -- the new 2021 M1-powered iPad Pro has more processing power and a better screen than most laptops in the world right now. The thing holding the iPad Pro back is software.\nApple\u2019s drawn-out, piecemeal transition plan for the iPad\nEver since the iPad\u2019s existence, some people have tried to use it paired with a third-party keyboard for a portable work machine. But it wasn\u2019t until Apple launched the iPad Pro in 2015, with a larger screen size and a first party keyboard case, that Apple itself pushed that idea with a series of ad campaigns. I, of course, was on board to try the setup, but I found it nearly impossible to do real work on the iPad Pro at the time because in 2015, the iPad still could only open one app at a time and didn't have a proper file management system.\nThis changed with 2017's iOS 11, when Apple gave the iPad version of iOS the ability to run two apps simultaneously in split-screen mode (with a third app hovering on top if needed), and a limited filing system that couldn\u2019t even detect external hard drives or memory cards. It was around this time that I could somewhat use the iPad Pro as a work machine, though the experience was still more cumbersome than just using a laptop.\nApple further improved matters in 2019 by forking iOS into iPadOS, which offered a more information-dense home screen and support for external hard drive and mouse/trackpads. Paired with Apple\u2019s expensive-but-excellent Magic Keyboard, the iPad Pro feels and looks like a laptop.\nSo Apple has been making progress to transition the iPad from literally just a super-sized iPhone that can\u2019t make calls into something resembling a productivity machine. It\u2019s just taking its sweet time.\nHow iPadOS holds this beast of a machine back\nBy now, most people should be aware that the new iPad Pro 2021 runs on Apple\u2019s critically acclaimed M1 chip that threw a monkey wrench into the computing industry. From my personal testing, the M1 iPad did indeed blow all my other devices (i9 Macs, older iPads, 2021 Android flagships) out of the water in benchmarks and video rendering tests. But these are niche testing scenarios \u2014 how many people out there render multi-track 4K videos regularly, if at all? For normal iPad usage, it feels mostly the same as the 2020 or even 2018 model of the iPad Pros. This is great in tablet mode, but when I try to do work, iPadOS is still too limiting.\nThe homescreen is not truly free\nLet\u2019s start with the homescreen. iPadOS\u2019 homescreen really is just a larger, wider version of the iPhone homescreen. You still must place apps or widgets in a conformed grid that goes top-down, left-to-right. I can\u2019t, say, for example, just put all my apps at the bottom row and leave the top two-thirds of the screen free.\nMulti-tasking\nThen there\u2019s multi-tasking. Being able to really open just two apps at once is too limiting for my current work flow. I am in fact typing this article on the iPad Pro now, and needing to keep Slack open takes up at least a third of the screen already. I can of course exit out of the app and still get notifications, but it won\u2019t show me as \"online\" to my colleagues. I wish there was a way to open apps in floating resizable window, like you know, on every laptop or even some Android phones, so I can keep Slack running but have it take up less screen space.\nOverly complicated filing system\nApples\u2019 file management system (officially named Files) can be useful if you\u2019re immersed in the Apple eco-system, because the system seamlessly blends in files from iCloud. For example, I love that I can access files on my MacBook\u2019s homescreen directly inside the iPad\u2019s (or iPhone\u2019s) Files app (provided I have enough iCloud storage). But some basic computer tasks we\u2019ve been doing for the past 20-30 years are still unusually complicated on Apple\u2019s filing system.\nIf I want to download an image from a website or an email attachment, the default download method downloads to iOS\u2019 iCloud drive and not to the iPad itself. If you want to do the latter (for offline access, or if maybe your iCloud storage is full), you have to first save that image to the iPad\u2019s photo gallery first, and then only from there can you save it to the iPad\u2019s local storage. It\u2019s an extra task that requires five to six taps.\nClose\nLimited external monitor support\nAnother new hardware upgrade to this year\u2019s iPad Pro is that the USB-C port is now a Thunderbolt port, which allows it to transfer files faster and support more accessories. But external monitor support remains very limited, bordering on useless. As it is now, all you can do is mirror your iPad Pro\u2019s display to an external monitor \u2014 you can\u2019t extend the screen to get more screen real estate. Even mirroring is weird because the iPad Pro\u2019s 4:3 aspect ratio doesn\u2019t play nice with most monitor\u2019s widescreen aspect ratio, so there's some major pillarboxing \u2014 black bars on the left and right side - going on.\nThe iPad Pro 2021 is too powerful to be just an iPad\nThese software shortcomings that chain the iPad as still more of a \"tablet\" than a \"computer\" have been around for years. But it\u2019s particularly frustrating with this year\u2019s iPad Pro because they run on the same chip that powers the M1 MacBook Air, whose performance has garnered universal critical acclaim.\nWhat\u2019s more, on the 1TB model I\u2019m testing, the iPad Pro comes with 16GB of RAM. All this power for a machine that still behaves fundamentally the same as an iPhone or older iPad?\nThe good news is, improvements to iPadOS are coming. Apple\u2019s annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) is taking place in a week, and Apple will surely have updates for iPadOS.\nHowever, the updates need to be substantial \u2014 like the rumor that Apple is bringing MacOS apps such as Final Cut Pro over to iPadOS. I personally want to see improved multi-tasking like floating resizable app windows or at least the ability to split-screen three apps at once. A free homescreen layout wouldn\u2019t hurt either.\nIf the updates are incremental like the last couple of years, then this 2021 iPad Pro is like having a six-figure sports car but driving it only in stop-and-go suburb traffic. It's nice to show off, but you have no real use of all that horsepower.\niPad Pro 2021 11-inch Apple iPad Pro 11-inch (2021) The 11-inch model of the iPad Pro may not have that Mini LED screen, but it still has the game-changing M1 processor and comes in a highly portable size.\n12.9-inch iPad Pro Apple iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2021) The screen on this 12.9-inch iPad Pro has to be seen to be believed. Add the M1 chip and this is almost too powerful for just an iPad.",

        "title": "Your iPhone and iCloud backups are full of gigabytes-worth of old iMessages that are virtually impossible to read, as \"scrolling to the top\" of conversations takes forever and can cause iMessages to crash",
        "body": "Many iPhone owners have iMessages from years ago that they can\u2019t access. For example, my wife and I simply want to read the first few messages that we exchanged in 2017, but we can\u2019t. A friend of mine recently had to prove she had a relationship with someone for US immigration services, and she was able to quickly download an easily searchable file containing all messages without using a 3rd-party tool in her efforts to do so. But she doesn\u2019t use iMessage, she uses another chat app.\nWe pay for the right to read our old messages in a few ways: precious space on our 64GB iPhones (the base level storage amount for iPhones), our Macs, and our iCloud storage, which Apple charges us for each month. Many other people have had this problem for several years, a quick Google search reveals:\nApple has had several years to listen to its users\u2019 complaints.\nThe cumbersome way Apple lets you (theoretically) access old messages is to \u201cscroll to the top\u201d of your conversation, but it\u2019s extremely time consuming and doesn\u2019t work in practice. Yesterday I tried to scroll to the \u201ctop\u201d of my iMessages that were from and to my wife. After just a few minutes, my computer with 16GB of RAM started \u201cbeach balling\u201d and the app froze before I could even get to messages from 6 months ago. Meanwhile, my wife tried to access our earliest messages on her iPhone 8 Plus and it was even sadder: after over 45 minutes of scrolling, she got within a year of the conversation\u2019s beginning and then the iMessages app crashed on her.\nWant to scroll to the top of an iMessages conversation? Good luck with that.\nEven if this \u201cscrolling to the top\u201d method had worked, it is unacceptable that it\u2019s the only way to get to the beginning of a conversation! I accept that users with better phones or shorter conversations may have more luck with this method, but how about a simple button to take you there, or better yet: a Google Photos-style month-by-month scrubber that will zip you around your iMessages timeline with ease:\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice if iMessages had an intuitive date picker like Google Photos?\niMessage search is a useless travesty\nAn easy way for Apple to improve iMessage search would be to allow searching by date (like in Apple Photos).\nSearching for particular iMessages is not useful because it\u2019s not reliable when searching for iMessages that are 2+ years old. The results miss the broader context of the conversation or, in my case, old messages simply don\u2019t show up in search. My wife and I know the text of our earliest messages (we have a screenshot of our first 5 or so messages), and search simply does not return them. But also, what if you forget the exact phrasing of an old message, you\u2019re doubly out of luck. (And no, I have never toggled the \u201cAuto Delete Old Conversations\u201d, which is an inappropriate choice to present users in the first place \u2013 for reasons I\u2019ll discuss below.)\nThe iMessage user experience (with respect to old conversations) has been locked in stasis for a decade, without any noticeable progress, despite everyone\u2019s conversations growing longer (and bigger, in terms of storage requirements).\nSurgery with a hack saw: \u201cAuto Delete Old Conversations\u201d\nThe choice to \u201cAuto Delete Old Conversations\u201d should never be put in front of users. Consider that most people seeing this \u201crecommendation\u201d are desperate for space and may not understand what\u2019s at stake here (like my parents), and this option is recommended to these users.\nThere is no reason that your iPhone should have to hold all your iMessages in order for you to keep them all. For example: my iPhone does not have to hold all of my photos in order for me to keep them. But when you are confronted with its recommendations, that\u2019s what you\u2019re led to believe.\nAgain, Apple is recommending users incur permanent data loss on years of conversations, without mentioning nuanced alternatives (like turning on iCloud messages or deleting some conversations but not others, wouldn\u2019t that be nice)! It\u2019s insane.\nOut of my 11.54GB of \u201cold conversations\u201d, I\u2019d guess that well over half of the messages are inaccessible to me. Notice the percentage of total space iMessages takes up.\nI can see why it would be tempting for iPhone users to take Apple up on their offer to delete all of their old messages, given they: 1.) can\u2019t even read those thousands of old iMessages, and 2.) the storage on their phones is full. The ultimatum to either \u201cgive up on preserving your correspondences with loved ones or have enough space to use your phone\u201d sounds like a deal Tim Cook would make if he were the don in The Godfather.\nTry presenting this \u201cdelete all your old stuff\u201d option to someone who has lost someone close to them, who treasures their old conversations with that person. Apple could even give the option to lose certain conversations and not others, but this \u201call or nothing\u201d approach falls embarrassingly short for the richest company in the world. And if \u201cAuto Delete Old Conversations\u201d is surgery with a hack saw, then reviewing a conversation\u2019s media attachments is like excavating a quarry with a spoon, and it also defeats the purpose of keeping conversations intact.\nBut won\u2019t competition eventually force Apple to improve iMessages?\nUnfortunately in this battle of the default messaging clients, there\u2019s only one rival OS: Android, and Android\u2019s messages app (and strategy around messages at large) is awful too. All other messaging apps are commodities (on both Android and iOS), and Google\u2019s approach to messages is so bad that Apple isn\u2019t sweating over losing users because of iMessages.\nTo be fair, most popular messaging clients, like WhatsApp, make it dead simple to download and view all of your messages. To do the same with iMessages, there\u2019s a whole slew of third party tools that slurp up your iMessages, and Apple should care about this, because having a strong demand for apps that process users\u2019 messages should be seen as a privacy failure by the company.\nA tale of wasted space and Services revenue\nApple used to boast about how many iMessages were sent daily, but has stayed silent on the topic for a long while. Back in 2014, Tim Cook said over 40 billion were sent each day. It has no doubt grown considerably in the past 7 years, and all these messages take up space on our devices or your iCloud accounts. iCloud starts at 5GB (for free), then goes to 50GB, then 200GB, and so on; so the first two tiers of iCloud are less than the base storage level of a 2021 iPhone. Even with iCloud messages turned on, each gigabyte taken up by iMessages is eating into a vanishingly small remaining pool.\nEach additional gigabyte of space consumed by iMessages brings users closer to filling up device storage and/or brings us closer to upgrading to paid iCloud storage. Tim Cook has increasingly emphasized growing services revenue (like iCloud storage) in their rosy financial forecasts for Wall Street.\nIf I\u2019m going to pay double for something like gigabytes-worth of old iMessages, I at least want to get something back in return. Right now, I\u2019m paying for gigabytes of dead weight. Do you know of any class action lawyers worth ringing up? Meanwhile, enjoy revisiting this prompt\u2026\nTo Apple, this means $$$\nAddendum: the fine readers of this article want me to share that, on Macs, there\u2019s an SQLite database, which can be inspected to read very old iMessages, although \u201cApple\u2019s chat.db has an esoteric schema owing to the fact they never designed it from the ground up and instead kept adding new columns and tables with each macOS release. This makes their queries super complicated with multiple joins.\u201d Hence, the demand for third-party tools. All things considered, not great options for the most heavily used consumer app on the world\u2019s second most dominant mobile OS. Find lively discussions on Reddit and Hacker News.",

        "title": "Apple's iMac predicted to overtake HP and lead the All-in-One market",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nApple's new M1 iMac\nIndustry sources are predicting that Apple's new iMac will overcome HP to lead the market in its field, but that's based partly on demand \u2014 and partly on the effects of the chip shortage.\nApple's new iMac may get the most attention, but it's not the only all-in-one computer available \u2014 and it's also not been the biggest seller. That title has previously gone to HP, which according to Digitimes, sold around 8% more all-in-ones than Apple in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThat reportedly equates to HP selling around 925,000 computers in the quarter, as compared to Apple's 860,000. Apple has subsequently launched a new iMac with a significant redesign, so it could be expected that it will do better.\nDigitimes sources do predict that Apple will overtake HP, at least for the next quarter. However, the global chip shortage is playing a part in that.\n\"With chip and component suppliers prioritizing their shipments supporting high-end products, such as the iMac, Apple is likely to overtake HP as the top all-in-one (AIO) PC brand vendor, according to industry sources,\" says Digitimes.\nSo HP, for instance, sells tower PCs, high performance ones, and gaming computers, as well as its iMac-like All-in-One range. Consequently if the company directs its limited supply of processors to those other models, it will be able to make fewer All-in-Ones.",

        "title": "If Apple is the only outfit capable of defending our privacy, it really is time to worry",
        "body": "A few weeks ago, Apple dropped its long-promised bombshell on the data-tracking industry. The latest version (14.5) of iOS \u2013 the operating system of the iPhone \u2013 included a provision that required app users explicitly to confirm that they wished to be tracked across the internet in their online activities. At the heart of the switch is a code known as \u201cthe identifier for advertisers\u201d or IDFA. It turns out that every iPhone comes with one of these identifiers, the object of which is to provide hucksters with aggregate data about the user\u2019s interests. For years, iPhone users had had the option to switch it off by digging into the privacy settings of their devices, but, because they\u2019re human, very few had bothered to do that.\nFrom 14.5 onwards, however, they couldn\u2019t avoid making a decision and you didn\u2019t have to be a Nobel laureate to guess that most iPhone users would opt out. Which explains why those who profit from the data-tracking racket had for months been going apeshit about Apple\u2019s perfidy. Some of the defensive PR mounted on their behalf, for example Facebook\u2019s weeping about the impact on small, defenceless businesses, defied parody. Other counteroffensives included attacks on Apple\u2019s monopolistic control over its App store and charges of rank hypocrisy \u2013 that changes in version 14.5 were not motivated by Apple\u2019s concerns for users\u2019 privacy but by its own plans to enter the advertising business. And so on.\nIt will be a while until we know for sure whether the apocalyptic fears of the data-trackers were accurate. It takes time for most iPhone users to install operating system updates and so these are still relatively early days. But the first figures are promising. One data analytics company, for example, has found that in the early weeks the daily opt-out rate for American users has been about 94%. This is much higher than surveys conducted in the run-up to the change had suggested \u2013 one had estimated an opt-out rate closer to 60%.\nIf the opt-out rate is as high as we\u2019ve seen so far, then it\u2019s bad news for the data-tracking racket, which the Financial Times estimates to be a $350bn industry, and good news for humanity.\nThe computerised, high-speed auction system in which online ads are traded seems not to be compatible with the law \u2013 and is currently unregulated. That is the conclusion of a remarkable recent investigation by two legal scholars, Michael Veale and Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius, who set out to examine whether this \u201creal-time bidding\u201d (RTB) system conforms to European data-protection law. They asked whether RTB complies with three rules of the European GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) \u2013 the requirement for a legal basis, transparency and security. They showed that for each of the requirements, most RTB practices do not comply. \u201cIndeed,\u201d they wrote, \u201cit seems close to impossible to make RTB comply.\u201d So, they concluded, it needs to be regulated.\nAn online system has been running wild for years, generating billions in profits for its participants\nIt does. Often the problem with tech regulation is that our legal systems need to be overhauled to deal with digital technology. But the irony in this particular case is that there\u2019s no need for such an overhaul: Europe already has the law in place. It\u2019s the GDPR, which is part of the legal code of every EU country and has provision for swingeing punishments for infringers. The problem is that it\u2019s not being effectively enforced.\nWhy not? The answer is that the EU delegates regulatory power to the relevant institutions \u2013 in this case data protection authorities \u2013 of its member states. And these local outfits are overwhelmed by the scale of the task and are lamentably under-resourced for it. Half of Europe\u2019s DPAs have only five technical experts or fewer. And the Irish data protection authority, on whose patch most of the tech giants have their European HQs, has the heaviest enforcement workload in Europe and is clearly swamped.\nSo here\u2019s where we are: an online system has been running wild for years, generating billions in profits for its participants. We have evidence of its illegitimacy and a powerful law on the statute book that in principle could bring it under control, but which we appear unable to enforce. And the only body that has, to date, been able to exert real control over the aforementioned racket is\u2026 a giant private company that itself is subject to serious concerns about its monopolistic behaviour. And the question for today: where is democracy in all this? You only have to ask to know the answer.\nWhat I\u2019ve been reading\nPlugged in\nThe Lithium Gold Rush: Inside the Race to Power Electric Vehicles is an absorbing and imaginative New York Times essay.\nHuman capital\nAn intriguing (and counterintuitive) post on the Noahpinion blog on why the economic impact of pandemic lockdowns is not what you think.\nIdol worship\nThe Martian is a crisp analysis of Elon Musk by Scott Galloway.",

        "title": "Amazon, Google, Apple back alliance to certify smart home devices that work together",
        "body": "An alliance sponsored by Apple, Google, Amazon and other tech companies will begin certifying smart home devices later this year using a network technology called Matter, an important step toward making smart home products like smart speakers and lightbulbs more widely accepted. One sign of the technology's how is that Matter will let smart-home products from Apple and Google work together despite the companies' longtime rivalry.\nThe new Matter logo on products and packaging will signify that smart devices, such as lightbulbs you turn on with Amazon Alexa or a video doorbell you monitor with Google Home , will get along well together. The logo looks like a trio of round-tipped arrows pointing toward a common center. The logo also will provide a way for consumers to quickly locate QR codes or numeric codes to help set up their devices.\nTobin Richardson, chief executive of the Connectivity Standards Alliance that's behind Matter, said in a May interview he expects the logo to become as \"ubiquitous\" as the Wi-Fi logo currently is.\n\"As these different devices become more complex networks, it's all the more important that they're all talking the same language,\" Richardson said. \"That mark will be a helping hand to make sure that you can add whatever lightbulbs, whatever door locks, whatever you want to add.\" Richardson made the comment in an interview ahead of a Matter press event.\nAnd at its Google I/O developer conference this week, Google announced plans to bring Matter support to its newer Nest thermostats, hubs and Wi-Fi network gear as well as its Android smartphone software. Google detailed its Matter support plans in a blog post.\nThe alliance's certification process is more evidence of the rapid pace of change in the smart home, part of the internet of things movement to digitize everything. Like smartphones , the smart home could quickly become central to your daily life.\nMatter is a new name for a smart-home alliance previously called CHIP, short for Connected Home over Internet Protocol. Unveiled in 2019, it employs the internet's core technology to smooth over the complexities of connecting smart-home devices. The technology allows users to control lighting, heating, home theaters, video doorbells, door locks and alarms through smart speakers.\nGetting all of these devices to get along -- especially with Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri and Google Assistant competing to be your preferred interface -- can be difficult. Matter is designed to unify the network domain, ensuring devices will work with any of those three main voice control systems. It should work even if you use more than one control system.\nExpect Matter to arrive in lightbulbs, thermostats, door locks, garage doors, alarms, window shades and TVs.\n\"Matter can be used to bridge together the many different systems people have in their homes today,\" said Chris DeCenzo, a smart home engineering leader at Amazon, during the press event.\nDevelopers should be pleased with Matter, said Kevin Po, Google Nest senior product manager. \"The smart home can't grow if each device maker has to develop products that work for each ecosystem protocol,\" he said, adding that Google will detail Matter developments at its Google I/O conference that starts May 18.\nSeveral companies hoping to cash in on the smart home trend are involved. Silicon Labs and Nordic Semiconductor are ready with Matter-capable chips and electronics boards for product design. Door lock company Assa Abloy will bring Matter to its Yale locks. Others planning Matter products include Comcast, Schlage, Schneider Electric and Huawei.\nMatter's Zigbee Alliance roots\nMatter allies developed their technology within the Zigbee Alliance, a group founded to work on the low-speed but energy-efficient Zigbee network technology that's used in some smart-home devices such as smart lightbulbs and alarm sensors. That group renamed itself the Connectivity Standards Alliance on Tuesday to reflect its mission beyond Zigbee.\nThe event drew appearances from smart speaker leaders Amazon and Google , internet service provider Comcast, Samsung's smart home SmartThings group, and Signify, which markets the Philips Hue lighting technology.\nThe allies have been developing Matter technology as a royalty free, open-source project on GitHub. In the last two weeks, they ratified the specification, a key step in letting device makers get to work on certification and making Matter support easier for developers.\nThe Matter logo signifies smart-home devices that are certified to get along well with each other and with the Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri and Google Assistant voice control systems. Connectivity Standards Alliance; illustration by Stephen Shankland/CNET\nMatter should make setups more streamlined, said Michelle Mindala-Freeman, who runs marketing for the alliance. Setup codes should let you link up your devices without having to download apps or link to cloud services.\nMatter also should lower barriers between different smart-home ecosystems so you don't have to worry whether a new product will work within your smart home setup. It \"breaks down the walls of the walled garden,\" Mindala-Freeman said.\nTo succeed, the Matter allies also will have to convince us the technology is trustworthy, not just simple. Privacy is top of mind with iPhones now cracking down on app tracking.\n\"We still have a long road ahead in terms of building the trust,\" Richardson said. \"You have to earn it.\"\nCorrection, May 12: Fixes spelling of Google Nest Senior Product Manager Kevin Po's name.",

        "title": "Updating an Apple Watch Series 3 is a nightmare in 2021",
        "body": "The Apple Watch Series 3 was first released in September 2017, bringing fitness improvements and a faster processor. Nearly four years later, in 2021, Apple is still selling the Series 3 as its entry-level Apple Watch model starting at $199, an $80 savings compared to the more recent Apple Watch SE. Only, as I\u2019ve recently learned, \u201cstill selling\u201d and \u201csupporting in a reasonable manner\u201d are two very different things, and updating an Apple Watch Series 3 in 2021 is a nightmare of infuriating technological hoops to jump through.\nNormally, updating an Apple Watch is an annoyingly long but straightforward process: you charge your Watch up to 50 percent, plug it in, and wait for the slow process of the update transferring and installing to your smartwatch.\nBut the non-cellular Apple Watch Series 3 has a tiny 8GB of internal storage, a fair chunk of which is taken up by the operating system and other critical software. So installing a major update \u2014 like the recently released watchOS 7.4 \u2014 goes something like this:\nUnpair and wipe your Apple Watch to factory settings Set up the Apple Watch again and restore from backup Realize you weren\u2019t supposed to restore from your backup yet Watch an episode or two of Brooklyn Nine-Nine while you wait for the backup to finish restoring Start from step one again \u2014 but as a brand-new Apple Watch, without restoring from an existing backup Update completely fresh Apple Watch, which now has enough free memory to update Consider how much you actually want to use this face unlocking feature everyone keeps hyping up in the first place Unpair and wipe the Apple Watch a third time Restore from your backup and finally use normally\nAnd the issue seems to apply whether you\u2019ve installed a pile of apps or not. Apple\u2019s support website doesn\u2019t even recommend that Series 3 owners bother trying to clear up space \u2014 it just advocates that they go straight to the aforementioned reset cycle.\nIt\u2019s clear that the current process is untenable.\nI\u2019m an editor at a technology news site and willing to put in the comical amount of time and energy to manage this, frustrating as it might be. But if you\u2019re a more casual user \u2014 the same one who is likely to own an older, outdated Watch in the first place \u2014 why on earth would you bother with the worst update mechanism since GE\u2019s instructions for resetting a smart bulb? And being able to update your hardware\u2019s software is important: the just-released watchOS 7.4.1, for example, patches a critical security flaw. But with it being so difficult to install, there\u2019s a good chance that plenty of Series 3 owners won\u2019t bother.\nI know that Apple loves to claim support for as many older hardware generations as it can with each new update. It\u2019s one of the biggest appeals of Apple products, compared to the lackluster pace of updates on competing Android phones (like the just-deprecated Galaxy S8).\nBut the miserable update process for the Series 3 is a strong argument that Apple is being a little too generous with what it considers \u201ccurrent\u201d hardware. Keeping the Series 3 around this long was always a money grab, a way for Apple to clear out old inventory and take advantage of mature manufacturing processes that have long since broken even in order to appeal to users who really can\u2019t afford the extra $80 for the markedly better Apple Watch SE. It\u2019s a similar trend to the inexplicably still-on-sale Apple TV HD, which is almost six years old and costs just $30 less than the brand-new 4K model. (Much like the Series 3, don\u2019t buy a new Apple TV HD in 2021 either.)",

There are third-party apps that will do it, but you don't need that, you just need Shortcuts.\nHow to make a QR code in a Shortcut\nGrab this Shortcut written by Stephen Robles for AppleInsider Run that once Save a copy of the result by Sharing it to yourself over AirDrop, Messages, Mail or more\nIf you'd rather try working out the Shortcut itself, Stephen's one really does two distinct jobs. It prompts for some information, and then it uses that information to create the QR code.\nSo at a minimum, you could use the Ask for Input step in Shortcuts and have a user prompted to enter the Wi-Fi network's name and password. That's really all you need, that Ask for Input, and then Generate QR Code From step.\nYou can download the Shortcut directly, but for interest here are the steps it goes through\nStephen's Shortcut does go further, though. Before you type in the network's name, it asks if you want to use the current Wi-Fi network you're on. And if you do, it then goes out and finds that network's name.\nYou still have to enter the password, but it's a lot handier to tap on a Wi-Fi network name than it is to type that too.\nWhat you have to do next\nStephen's Shortcut ends by displaying the QR code and giving you the option to share it. You could add a step that automatically saves it somewhere.\nOr even that automatically emails a copy to anyone you choose.\nWhat your guest has to do\nWhen the guest is within range of your network, they can scan the QR code. Assuming you've entered the network name and password correctly when you were making the code, that's all they have to do.\nL-R your guest looks for a QR code, the iPhone registers it, and it unlocks the network\nPoint the phone's cameras at a QR code, tap to confirm when prompted whether they want to join this network, and it's done.\nFor the sake of a few minutes work in advance by you, they get straight on your network in moments.",

        "title": "Apps Reportedly Limited to Maximum of 5GB RAM in iPadOS, Even With 16GB M1 iPad Pro",
        "body": "Despite Apple offering the M1 iPad Pro in configurations with 8GB and 16GB of RAM, developers are now indicating that apps are limited to just 5GB of RAM usage, regardless of the configuration the app is running on.\nThe \u200cM1\u200c \u200ciPad Pro\u200c comes in two memory configurations; the 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB models feature 8GB of RAM, while the 1TB and 2TB variants offer 16GB of memory, the highest ever in an iPad. Even with the unprecedented amount of RAM on the iPad, developers are reportedly severely limited in the amount they can actually use.\nPosted by the developer behind the graphic and design app Artstudio Pro on the Procreate Forum, apps can only use 5GB of RAM on the new \u200cM1\u200c \u200ciPad\u200c Pros. According to the developer, attempting to use anymore will cause the app to crash.\nThere is a big problem with M1 iPad Pro. After making stress test and other tests on new M1 iPad Pro with 16GB or RAM, it turned out that app can use ONLY 5GB or RAM! If we allocate more, app crashes. It is only 0.5GB more that in old iPads with 6GB of RAM! I suppose it isn't better on iPad with 8GB.\nFollowing the release of its M1-optimized app, Procreate also noted on Twitter that with either 8GB or 16GB of available RAM, the app is limited by the amount of RAM it can use.\nAs of now, all M1 iPads have the same amount of RAM available. As soon as we have access to more, we\u2019ll pass that on to you, too \ud83d\udc9c \u2014 Procreate (@Procreate) May 28, 2021\nThe previous maximum RAM in an \u200ciPad\u200c was last year's \u200ciPad Pro\u200c which featured 6GB of RAM, regardless of storage configuration. Given, a 5GB limit on apps imposed by iPadOS wouldn't necessarily ring any alarm bells as developers would have access to the majority of the available memory. Although, with the \u200cM1\u200c \u200ciPad Pro\u200c, developers cannot tap the full potential of the available hardware.\nThe added RAM, especially in the higher-end 1TB and 2TB models, will still benefit the user by allowing them to keep more apps open in the background. iPadOS itself can access the \u200cM1\u200c's entire pool of unified memory, while apps can reportedly only access 5GB of it.\n\u200ciPad\u200c users have long voiced the mantra that iPadOS doesn't take full advantage of the available hardware and potential of the \u200ciPad Pro\u200c, and now thanks to the \u200cM1\u200c chip inside of the \u200ciPad Pro\u200c, that's certainly more of a case.\nApple will hold its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 7, where it's expected to announce iOS 15, watchOS 8, macOS 12, tvOS 15, and iPadOS 15. Bloomberg has reported that iPadOS 15 will include the biggest redesign to the iPad homescreen since the iPad first launched, including the ability for users to place widgets anywhere on the grid.\nWe've contacted Apple for clarification regarding the amount of RAM apps can access and will update this post if we hear back.",

        "title": "Rumor: Apple to Announce Third-Generation AirPods and HiFi Apple Music Tier on May 18",
        "body": "A new rumor suggests that Apple will announce the third-generation AirPods and the recently rumored HiFi, or high-fidelity Apple Music tier, on Tuesday, May 18, via a press release on its website.\nThe new rumor comes from Apple YouTuber Luke Miani who shared the alleged exclusive news with the AppleTrack website. According to the YouTuber, Apple plans to release the next-generation AirPods through a Newsroom update and website refresh.\nMiani, who we reached out to, said that new AirPods could be announced on May 18 via a press release that could also include a 'Apple Music HiFi' debut\nIn 2019, Apple released the all-new AirPods Pro via a press release on its website, so while it seems plausible, the information should be taken with a grain of salt. The new AirPods are expected to feature an updated design that's more in-line with the design of the \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c but lacking in \"Pro\" features such as Active Noise Cancellation.\nThe new AirPods will be the first major update to the standard AirPods following a slight refresh in 2019 which featured wireless charging, Hey Siri support, and improved battery life. Reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that the new AirPods would entire mass production in the third quarter of this year.\nAlongside the new third-generation AirPods, Apple plans to announce a brand new HiFi or high-fidelity \u200cApple Music\u200c tier, according to the new rumor. A report earlier this month indicated that Apple plans to begin offering Apple Music subscribers higher quality streaming with a new subscription tier in the \"coming weeks.\"\nAccording to that report, the tier will cost the same $9.99 as the current individual \u200cApple Music\u200c package. Still, specifics around how Apple plans to include HiFi music streaming into its existing tiers remain unknown. Code within the first beta of the upcoming iOS 14.6 update found by MacRumors suggests that HiFi \u200cApple Music\u200c streaming could be limited to only compatible hardware.\nWhile the source for the HiFi \u200cApple Music\u200c report pinned a launch of the new tier and AirPods as being only a few weeks away, it may have been referring to a launch at WWDC. Apple will hold its annual Worldwide Developers Conference beginning on June 7 where it is expected to announce brand new updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Despite WWDC being software-focused, hardware announcements at the event are certainly possible.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nWarren Buffet has hailed Tim Cook as a \"fantastic manager\" of Apple, declaring him \"one of the best managers in the world,\" during the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting.\nStreamed on Saturday, Warren Buffett answered questions from shareholders about Berkshire Hathaway and its investments. In one question asking why the investment firm sold some common stock in Apple despite being considered the company's \"fourth jewel,\" Buffett moved to compliment Apple as a company, and Cook as its leader.\n\"It's an extraordinary - Apple - it's got a fantastic manager,\" starts Buffett in a video feed aired by Yahoo Finance. \"Tim Cook was underappreciated for a while. He's one of the best managers in the world. And I've seen a lot of managers. And he's got a product that people absolutely love. And there's an installed base of people, and they get satisfaction rates of 99%.\"\n\"It's an extraordinary business. But I do want to emphasize that, in his own way - it's a different way - but Tim Cook is - we see a lot of managers of a lot of businesses, and you're looking at two great ones on both ends here,\" Buffett continued, before comparing Cook to co-founder and previous CEO Steve Jobs as men with different capabilities.\nIn the comparison, Buffet says Cook \"handled that business so well. He couldn't do what Steve Jobs obviously could do in terms of creation. But Steve Jobs couldn't really, I don't think, do what Tim Cook has done in many respects.\"\nAlso present at the meeting, Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger offered further praise of big tech in general, but warned antitrust pushes against the companies in the U.S. and Europe could hold back their growth. Neither Munger nor Buffett were concerned that any of the tech giants were too big.\n\"They're a credit to the market, and a credit to their civilization,\" commented Munger. \"They're huge, and that's good for us.\"\nBerkshire joined in by adding \"The Googles and the Apples - they are incredible companies in terms of what they earn on capital. They gush out more money.\"\nOn the subject of the Berkshire Apple share sale, Buffett said that he sold some stock in 2020, but shareholders still saw their percentage interest rise because Berkshire repurchased shares.\nHe also admitted that the sale \"was probably a mistake,\" before pointing out Munger let him know \"in his usual low-key way\" that it was a misstep.",

        "title": "Apple brass discussed disclosing 128-million iPhone hack, then decided not to",
        "body": "In September 2015, Apple managers had a dilemma on their hands: should, or should they not notify 128 million iPhone users of what remains the worst mass iOS compromise on record? Ultimately, all evidence shows, they chose to keep quiet.\n128 million infected\nThe mass hack first came to light when researchers uncovered 40 malicious App Store apps , a number that mushroomed to 4,000 as more researchers poked around. The apps contained code that made iPhones and iPads part of a botnet that stole potentially sensitive user information.\nAn email entered into court this week in Epic Games\u2019 lawsuit against Apple shows that, on the afternoon of September 21, 2015, Apple managers had uncovered 2,500 malicious apps that had been downloaded a total of 203 million times by 128 million users, 18 million of whom were in the US.\n\u201cJoz, Tom and Christine\u2014due to the large number of customers potentially affected, do we want to send an email to all of them?\u201d App Store VP Matthew Fischer wrote, referring to Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Greg Joswiak and Apple PR people Tom Neumayr and Christine Monaghan. The email continued:\nIf yes, Dale Bagwell from our Customer Experience team will be on point to manage this on our side. Note that this will pose some challenges in terms of language localizations of the email, since the downloads of these apps took place in a wide variety of App Store storefronts around the world (e.g. we wouldn\u2019t want to send an English-language email to a customer who downloaded one or more of these apps from the Brazil App Store, where Brazilian Portuguese would be the more appropriate language).\nThe dog ate our disclosure\nAbout 10 hours later, Bagwell discusses the logistics of notifying all 128 million affected users, localizing notifications to each users\u2019 language, and \u201caccurately includ[ing] the names of the apps for each customer.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAlas, all appearances are that Apple never followed through on its plans. An Apple representative could point to no evidence that such an email was ever sent. Statements the representative sent on background\u2014meaning I\u2019m not permitted to quote them\u2014noted that Apple instead published only this now-deleted post.\nThe post provides very general information about the malicious app campaign and eventually lists only the top 25 most downloaded apps. \u201cIf users have one of these apps, they should update the affected app which will fix the issue on the user\u2019s device,\u201d the post stated. \u201cIf the app is available on [the] App Store, it has been updated, if it isn\u2019t available it should be updated very soon.\u201d\nGhost of Xcode\nThe infections were the result of legitimate developers writing apps using a counterfeit copy of Xcode, Apple\u2019s iOS and OS X app development tool. The repackaged tool dubbed XcodeGhost surreptitiously inserted malicious code alongside normal app functions.\nFrom there, apps caused iPhones to report to a command-and-control server and provide a variety of device information, including the name of the infected app, the app-bundle identifier, network information, the device\u2019s \u201cidentifierForVendor\u201d details, and the device name, type, and unique identifier.\nXcodeGhost billed itself as faster to download in China, compared with Xcode available from Apple. For developers to have run the counterfeit version, they would have had to click through a warning delivered by Gatekeeper, the macOS security feature that requires apps to be digitally signed by a known developer.\nStopping Dr. Jekyll\nThe lack of follow-through is disappointing. Apple has long prioritized the security of the devices it sells. It has also made privacy a centerpiece of its products. Directly notifying those affected by this lapse would have been the right thing to do. We already knew that Google routinely doesn\u2019t notify users when they download malicious Android apps or Chrome extensions . Now we know that Apple has done the same thing.\nAdvertisement\nThe email wasn\u2019t the only one that showed Apple brass hashing out security problems. A separate one sent to Apple Fellow Phil Schiller and others in 2013 forwarded a copy of the Ars article headlined \u201cSeemingly benign \u2018Jekyll\u2019 app passes Apple review, then becomes \u2018evil.\u2019\u201d\nThe article discussed research from computer scientists who found a way to sneak malicious programs into the App Store without being detected by the mandatory review process that\u2019s supposed to automatically flag such apps. Schiller and the other people receiving the email wanted to figure out how to shore up its protections in light of their discovery that the static analyzer Apple used wasn\u2019t effective against the newly discovered method.\n\u201cThis static analyzer looks at API names rather than true APIs being called, so there\u2019s often the issue of false positives,\u201d Apple Senior VP of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue wrote. \u201cThe Static Analyzer enables us to catch direct accessing of Private APIs, but it completely misses apps using indirect methods of accessing these Private APIs. This is what the authors used in their Jekyll apps.\u201d\nThe email went on to discuss limitations of two other Apple defenses, one known as Privacy Proxy and the other Backdoor Switch.\n\u201cWe need some help in convincing other teams to implement this functionality for us,\u201d Cue wrote. \u201cUntil then, it is more brute force, and somewhat ineffective.\u201d\nLawsuits involving large companies often provide never-before-seen portals into the inner workings of the way they and their executives work. Often, as the case is here, those views are at odds with the companies\u2019 talking points. The trial resumes next week.",

        "title": "M1 iMac is Up to 56% Faster Than Prior-Generation High-End 21.5-Inch iMac",
        "body": "Apple's M1 iMacs are set to start delivering to customers next week, and ahead of the official launch day, benchmarks for the machines have been showing up on Geekbench, likely from reviewers who are testing them.\nIt will come as no surprise that \u200cM1\u200c iMac benchmarks are right on par with benchmarks for the \u200cM1\u200c MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini, coming in with an average single-core score of 1724 and an average multi-core score of 7453, aggregated from three benchmarks that are currently available.\nBenchmarks are for the iMac21,1, which is likely the entry-level option with an 8-core CPU, a 7-core GPU, and two Thunderbolt ports. The \u200cM1\u200c \u200ciMac\u200c benchmarks list 8 CPU cores and a base frequency of 3.2GHz, and they're running macOS 11.3.\n\u200cM1\u200c \u200ciMac\u200c\nThe 24-inch \u200cM1\u200c \u200ciMac\u200c significantly outperforms the 2019 21.5-inch \u200ciMac\u200c with an Intel chip that it's replacing, and it's going to be a solid upgrade over all older 21.5-inch machines.\nThe previous-generation high-end 21.5-inch \u200ciMac\u200c earned a single-core score of 1109 and a multi-core score of 6014, so the \u200cM1\u200c \u200ciMac\u200c is 56 percent faster when it comes to single-core performance and 24 percent faster when it comes to multi-core performance.\n2019 high-end 21.5-inch Intel \u200ciMac\u200c\nCompared to the current high-end 27-inch \u200ciMac\u200c, the \u200cM1\u200c Mac outperforms in single-core performance, but it is lagging behind the 10th-generation Comet Lake Intel chip in multi-core performance. The high-end 27-inch \u200ciMac\u200c earned a single-core score of 1247 and a multi-core score of 9002.\nThe \u200cM1\u200c \u200ciMac\u200c's single-core performance is 38 percent faster, but the Intel \u200ciMac\u200c's multi-core performance is 25 percent faster.\nWith these scores, the \u200cM1\u200c \u200ciMac\u200c is not going to be able to replace the high-end 27-inch \u200ciMac\u200c because it lags behind in multi-core performance, but Apple is working on higher-end Apple silicon chips for desktop machines and we'll likely see an even more powerful Apple-designed chip introduced when Apple is ready to replace the 27-inch \u200ciMac\u200c with a new model.\nThe \u200cM1\u200c \u200ciMac\u200c does outperform lower-end 27-inch \u200ciMac\u200c models with Intel chips, beating the 6-core Intel models in both single and multi-core performance.\nPricing on the \u200cM1\u200c iMacs starts at $1,299 for the entry-level model and $1,499 for the version with an 8-core GPU, two additional USB-C ports, Gigabit Ethernet, and additional color options. \u200cM1\u200c \u200ciMac\u200c models ordered today will ship out in June, but those who preordered will soon be receiving their machines, and we'll learn more about them when reviews go live.",

        "title": "Apple hires ex-Facebook ad manager Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez for their ads team, who wrote a tell-all book on Facebook",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nCredit: Helena Price/Recode\nApple has hired former Facebook ads product manager Antonio Garcia Martinez, a sign that the Cupertino tech giant is expanding its own advertising ambitions.\nGarcia Martinez, who is also known for authoring the autobiography \"Chaos Monkeys,\" joined Apple in April as part of the company's ad platforms product engineering team. He will be based in Cupertino, according to Business Insider.\nApple's ad platforms team works on advertising technology within the App Store and in other locations across Apple's ecosystem, including Apple News and the Stocks app.\nGarcia Martinez worked at Facebook between 2011 and 2013, and became an influential figure on the company's ad product team. He worked on ad targeting efforts and eventually became product manager of FBX, Facebook's now defunct ad exchange.\nThe move is only the latest to suggest that Apple is working to expand its own advertising business. Apple recently added new ad slots to the App Store, and is working on allowing advertisers to promote their apps directly to users.\nNews of Apple's advertising ambitions come shortly after the company launched a privacy feature in iOS 14.5 that requires all apps to ask for permission before tracking users. Facebook has been a vocal critic of the feature, and some advertising trade groups have lodged their own complaints about it.\nSome industry watchers believe that the privacy feature could boost Apple's own advertising business as advertisers look to other methods beyond traditional tracking. Bernstein analyst said in 2018 Apple's App Store ads business could be a $2 billion endeavor by 2020.\nAlongside Garcia Martinez, Apple also appears to be expanding the scope of its ads teams. As of Monday, May 10, Apple has about 50 open roles related to ad platforms. That includes one listing that suggests Apple is forming a new team focused on fighting fraudulent ad traffic.\nIt does appear that Apple is looking to be a different kind of advertising company than rivals like Facebook or Google. One job listing suggests that Apple is hiring engineers that could help it set standards for \"effective advertising while protecting user privacy.\"",
