        "title": "iPhone owners are about 21 times more likely to negatively judge a date who uses an Android phone",
        "body": "To a certain type of gadget user, an Android smartphone is a symbol of defiance. These users see Google\u2019s software \u2014 its customization options, hardware affordability, and no-frills design \u2014 as the perfect refutation of the sterile, mass-marketed appeal of Apple\u2019s iPhone. Your Tinder date, however, doesn\u2019t care about any of that, according to cold, raw data. In fact, your date is judging you, and so are their friends, family, and likely everyone sitting in and around your table at dinner and then later on at the bar.\niPhone owners are far more likely to hate on Android phones\nAccording to a study conducted by Match.com and Research Now, iPhone owners are about 21 times more likely to negatively judge a date who uses an Android phone. On the flip side, Android owners are only 15 times as likely to negatively judge a date for opting for iOS.\nWhat this says about iPhone users isn\u2019t really clear. Perhaps they\u2019re haughty, condescending elitists who see technology as a badge of social status, and an $800 cellphone as a way to lord that over others. Or maybe they just really have no idea why your text messages are green and not blue. This confusing deviation from the norm could really freak them out \u2014 or in the case of this writer, get you coyly made fun of until the overwhelming shame forces you to trade in your Nexus. (We\u2019ll leave the Google Pixel, an excellent and pricey Android smartphone, out of this debate.)",

        "title": "Firm That Helped FBI Break Into San Bernardino iPhone Gets Hacked, Tools Leaked Online",
        "body": "Now the hacker responsible has publicly released a cache of files allegedly stolen from Cellebrite relating to Android and BlackBerry devices, and older iPhones, some of which may have been copied from publicly available phone cracking tools.\nIn January, Motherboard reported that a hacker had stolen 900GB of data from mobile phone forensics company Cellebrite. The data suggested that Cellebrite had sold its phone cracking technology to oppressive regimes such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia.\nThe hacker claimed to have taken the newly released data from a remote Cellebrite server, and said they had extracted them from UFED images. They told Motherboard that the files were encrypted, likely in an attempt to protect Cellebrite's intellectual property, but that they managed to bypass the protections.\nCellebrite is an Israeli firm which specializes in extracting data from mobile phones for law enforcement agencies. The company's flagship product, the Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED), typically comes as a small, laptop-sized device, and can pull SMS messages, emails, and more from thousands of different mobile phone models. The investigator needs to have physical access to the phone to analyze it.\n\"It's important to demonstrate that when you create these tools, they will make it out. History should make that clear,\" they continued.\n\"The debate around backdoors is not going to go away, rather, its is almost certainly going to get more intense as we lurch toward a more authoritarian society,\" the hacker told Motherboard in an online chat.\n\"The ripped, decrypted and fully functioning Python script set to utilize the exploits is also included within,\" the hacker wrote in a README file accompanying the data dump. The hacker posted links to the data on Pastebin.\nIt's not clear when any of this code was used in the UFED. Many of the directory names start with \"ufed\" followed by a different type of phone, such as BlackBerry or Samsung.\nIn their README, the hacker notes much of the iOS-related code is very similar to that used in the jailbreaking scene\u2014a community of iPhone hackers that typically breaks into iOS devices and release its code publicly for free.\nJonathan Zdziarski, a forensic scientist, agreed that some of the iOS files were nearly identical to tools created and used by the jailbreaking community, including patched versions of Apple's firmware designed to break security mechanisms on older iPhones. A number of the configuration files also reference \"limera1n,\" the name of a piece of jailbreaking software created by infamous iPhone hacker Geohot. He said he wouldn't call the released files \"exploits\" however.\nZdziarski also said that other parts of the code were similar to a jailbreaking project called QuickPwn, but that the code had seemingly been adapted for forensic purposes. For example, some of the code in the dump was designed to brute force PIN numbers, which may be unusual for a normal jailbreaking piece of software.",

        "title": "Apple, Facebook, Google, and 94 others file opposition to Trump's immigration ban",
        "body": "A host of big-name tech companies including Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft have filed an amicus brief in a Washington state court opposing Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration. A total of 97 firms put their names to the document, which supports the state of Washington in its battle against what is widely considered a Muslim ban, each one stating that their \u201coperations are affected\u201d by the executive order.\n\u201cThe Order represents a significant departure from the principles of fairness and predictability that have governed the immigration system of the United States for more than fifty years,\u201d the brief reads, indicating a philosophical objection from the signees. But they also present an economic argument, saying that the order also \u201cinflicts significant harm on American business, innovation, and growth,\u201d disrupting current operations, and making it \u201cmore difficult and expensive for US companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world\u2019s best employees.\u201d\nFull list of companies (1/2): pic.twitter.com/YfQ5dDeXM5 \u2014 Brian Goldman (@briangoldman) February 6, 2017\nAs well as established tech giants, the list of companies who signed the document includes newer power players such as Netflix and Uber, as well as successes like Spotify and Kickstarter. Amazon \u2014 which has its headquarters in Washington state \u2014 is not on the list, but was one of the first companies to support the state\u2019s lawsuit against the order. Amazon refrained from joining the latest amicus because the state\u2019s attorney general preferred that it remain part of the original complaint.\nConspicuously absent from the list is Tesla; its CEO Elon Musk has already shown an inclination to work with Donald Trump rather than push back against his hastily drawn-up policies. Musk notably asked Twitter for advice on how to tweak the immigration order, arguing that revoking it was impossible, and attended the president\u2019s recent economic forum.\nWashington is the spearhead against the order\nWhile several federal courts across the United States issued temporary halts on president Trump\u2019s immigration order, it\u2019s Washington state that has mounted the strongest legal attack on the ruling. Bob Ferguson, the state\u2019s attorney general, has led a strong campaign against the order, calling it \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional,\u201d and stating that it would have detrimental effects to Washington itself.\nToday\u2019s Amicus brief shows that some of the United States\u2019 biggest and most dynamic companies agree with Ferguson\u2019s message. And as companies come to terms with how many of their own employees are affected by the travel ban, their support for Washington\u2019s legislation shows a more hardline attitude than previously displayed. Indeed, by signing the brief, many of these firms are making their strongest statement yet on the Trump administration\u2019s immigration order, and throwing their weight behind the best chance yet to have it scrapped.",

Apple was one of more than 120 tech companies that filed a legal brief condemning Trump\u2019s executive order banning refugees and travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\nFor more on tech companies opposing Trump\u2019s travel ban, watch Fortune\u2019s video:\nCook reminded the audience that Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, the son of a Syrian immigrant, and said the ban had an immediate effect on international tech firms. A number of Apple employees were initially denied entry to the U.S. when the order, which has been temporarily stayed by a legal battle, was first implemented.\n\u201cIf we stand and say nothing it\u2019s as if we\u2019re agreeing, that we become a part of it,\u201d the BBC quoted Cook as saying. \u201cIt\u2019s important to speak out.\u201d",

        "body": "Fake news is \u201ckilling people\u2019s minds\u201d, Tim Cook, the head of Apple, has said. The technology boss said firms such as his own needed to create tools that would help stem the spread of falsehoods, without impinging on freedom of speech.\nCook also called for governments to lead information campaigns to crack down on fake news in an interview with a British national newspaper. The scourge of falsehoods in mainstream political discourse came to the fore during recent campaigns, during which supporters of each side were accused of promoting misinformation for political gain.\n\u201cWe are going through this period of time right here where unfortunately some of the people that are winning are the people that spend their time trying to get the most clicks, not tell the most truth,\u201d Cook told the Daily Telegraph. \u201cIt\u2019s killing people\u2019s minds, in a way.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cAll of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news. We must try to squeeze this without stepping on freedom of speech and of the press, but we must also help the reader. Too many of us are just in the \u2018complain\u2019 category right now and haven\u2019t figured out what to do.\u201d\nHe said that a crackdown would mean that \u201ctruthful, reliable, non-sensational, deep news outlets will win\u201d, adding: \u201cThe [rise of fake news] is a short-term thing. I don\u2019t believe that people want that.\u201d\nWhile instances were seen among supporters of both sides of the recent US election battle, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign was seen by many as a particular beneficiary of fake news reports.\nAnd the US president\u2019s team has been caught sending aides out to insist that a huge crowd had attended his inauguration, when the evidence showed a relatively modest audience was there.\nTrump\u2019s spokesman, Sean Spicer, insisted that the event had attracted \u201cthe largest audience ever to witness an inauguration \u201d and Trump said he believed the crowd went \u201call the way back to the Washington Monument\u201d.\nImages from the moment Trump was taking the oath showed the crowd was relatively small and went nowhere near as far back down Washington\u2019s National Mall as the monument. Other evidence suggested a relatively small crowd in attendance.\nSenior aide Kellyanne Conway later characterised the Trump administration\u2019s falsehoods as \u201calternative facts\u201d.\nFake anti-Trump stories during the election included one in which it was falsely claimed that he had groped the drag queen and television presenter RuPaul. Hillary Clinton was scrutin ised over her claim that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d her emails had been hacked because the FBI director, James Comey, had concluded it was likely they had been.\nA study by economists at Stanford University and New York University published two months after November\u2019s US presidential election found that in the run-up to the vote, fake anti-Clinton stories had been shared 30 million times on Facebook, while those favouring her were shared eight million times.\nIt said: \u201cThe average American saw and remembered 0.92 pro-Trump fake news stories and 0.23 pro-Clinton fake news stories, with just over half of those who recalled seeing fake news stories believing them.\u201d\nBut it called into question the power of fake news reports spread on social media to alter the outcome of the election, saying that, \u201cfor fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake article would need to have had the same persuasive effect as 36 television campaign ads\u201d.\nNevertheless, Cook demanded action to decrease the reach of fake news. \u201cWe need the modern version of a public service announcement campaign. It can be done quickly, if there is a will.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt has to be ingrained in the schools, it has to be ingrained in the public. There has to be a massive campaign. We have to think through every demographic... It\u2019s almost as if a new course is required for the modern kid, for the digital kid.\n\u201cIn some ways kids will be the easiest to educate. At least before a certain age, they are very much in listen and understand [mode], and they then push their parents to act. We saw this with environmental issues: kids learning at school and coming home and saying why do you have this plastic bottle? Why are you throwing it away?\u201d",

The process of moving more than 12,000 people will take over six months, and construction of the buildings and parklands is scheduled to continue through the summer.\nEnvisioned by Steve Jobs as a center for creativity and collaboration, Apple Park is transforming miles of asphalt sprawl into a haven of green space in the heart of the Santa Clara Valley. The campus\u2019 ring-shaped, 2.8 million-square-foot main building is clad entirely in the world\u2019s largest panels of curved glass.",

        "title": "Apple patents screen tech capable of reading fingerprints without dedicated sensor",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nAn Apple patent grant on Tuesday suggests the company is looking to leverage its LuxVue acquisition to integrate display technology capable of reading a user's fingerprint without a dedicated sensor, a design feature rumored to see release with \"iPhone 8.\"\nAs published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday, Apple's U.S. Patent No. 9,570,002 for an \"Interactive display panel with IR diodes\" details a touch display that incorporates micro-LED sensing technology instead of the ubiquitous active matrix hardware seen on most mobile devices.\nThe IP was reassigned to Apple last April from LuxVue, a small company specializing in highly efficient micro-LED displays and associated technology. Apple purchased the firm for an undisclosed sum in 2014.\nAmong other facets, including the ability to completely replace bulky capacitive sensor components with strategically placed infrared light emitters and sensors, today's patent lays out a design for incorporating touch panels and fingerprint sensors using largely similar hardware. Interestingly, some embodiments jibe with rumors surrounding a rumored \"iPhone 8\" with full-face display, specifically rumblings about an \"invisible\" home button and Touch ID sensor.\nApple's current fingerprint sensing technology requires a capacitive drive ring to be in contact with a user's finger during operation. To create a completely clean display surface, as hinted at in multiple iPhone rumors, the company would need to fully integrate, or more likely remove, said drive ring from the fcover glass.\nIt is possible that Apple is looking to ditch Touch ID altogether as it moves to a new, more advanced system. For example, a touchscreen capable of acting as an input device and fingerprint scanner would save space and grant greater design flexibility. Finding a working technology, however, is difficult, as fingerprint sensor readings need to be highly accurate, much more so than a traditional touchscreen.\nLuxVue believes it solved the puzzle, or is at least on its way to doing so. According to the patent, micro-LEDs can be used as a surrogate for standard capacitive touch arrays. Specifically, separate IR emitting and sensing diodes connect to driving and selection circuitry to create a subpixel circuit. Due to their small size, these IR diodes can be embedded into a display substrate alongside RGB LEDs or on a microchip mounted to said substrate.\nDubbed \"interactive pixels,\" the subpixel arrangement could incorporate red, green, blue, IR emitting and IR sensing LEDs (RGBIRSIR), as well as other color arrays, in an extremely high resolution panel. In some embodiments, the system can be calibrated to perform any number of operations based on sensing component input. For example, the circuit might act as a traditional ambient light sensor to brighten or dim displays, or perform proximity detection tasks to shut off touch input during phone calls.\nMore advanced features like touch detection and determining the surface profile of a target (fingerprint recognition) are also outlined. Germane to rumors of Apple's rumored iPhone, these latter embodiments operate by bouncing IR light off of a user's finger and back to sensing diodes.\nDuring operation, rows, or in some cases dedicated areas, of a display containing interactive pixels scan for a user's finger. When an object comes within sufficient proximity for sensing, a bitmap is generated to inform the system of proximate positioning data.\nIn some cases, bitmaps can include information about the intensity of incoming light, allowing deeper analysis of the object and its surface. For example, by examining dark and bright spots of the bitmap a sample system can detect corresponding ridges and grooves in a user's fingerprint.\nAddressing the issue of security, the patent notes certain areas of the display might include sections that have a higher density of interactive pixels and supporting chips. Additional emitting and sensing circuits means greater pixel densities, which in turn translates into more accurate fingerprint readings.\nAlternatively, the proposed screen might contain a sufficient number of interactive pixels to turn the entire surface into a fingerprint reader.\nOther embodiments note the use of IR light allows sensing components to remain active even when it appears as though the screen is off, beneficial in saving power and operating the device in low-light environments.\nWhether Apple intends to bring the micro-LED technology to iPhone or another future product remains unknown. The company is widely rumored to launch an \"iPhone 8\" model this year with an edge-to-edge display. Such a design would require the company to move, hide or delete features incorporated into its contemporary handsets, including proximity and ambient light sensors, and the Touch ID fingerprint module.",

The iPhone maker captured 18 percent of the global market in the December quarter, said the firm.\nApple on Tuesday reported it sold 78.3 million iPhones in the fourth quarter, snapping a three-quarter streak of iPhone unit sales declines. The results, fueled by sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , pushed Apple to its highest-quarter revenue and per-share earnings ever.\nSamsung, which faced a massive Note 7 recall due to faulty batteries, dropped to second place, said Strategy Analytics. Samsung shipped 77.5 million smartphones worldwide during the fourth quarter, according to the firm, a 5 percent drop from the 81.3 million phones it shipped in the final three months of 2015.\n\"This was the iPhone's best performance for over a year, as Apple capitalized on Samsung's recent missteps,\" Neil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics, said in a statement. \"Samsung will be banking on the rumored Galaxy S8 model in a few weeks' time to reignite growth and return to the top spot in quarterly smartphone shipments.\"\nOverall, global smartphone shipments grew 3 percent to hit 1.5 billion units in 2016. Rounding out the top five phone vendors for the fourth quarter were Huawei, OPPO and Vivo. The global smartphone market, which has been sluggish in recent years, recovered some due to stronger demand in developing markets like China and Africa, said the firm.\nDoes the Mac still matter?Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.\nTech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.",

        "body": "The San Bernardino iPhone hack story rumbles on, with three news organizations insisting that there is no good reason for the FBI to withhold the cost of accessing the phone. Associated Press, Vice Media and USA Today have asked a US judge to force the FBI to reveal the information, reports the BBC \u2026\nThe FBI had been criticized for spending what was reputed to be around a million dollars to access the work phone of one of the shooters. Given the care the pair took to destroy their own phones and computers, it had always seemed unlikely they would have left evidence on the iPhone in question, and the FBI later admitted that nothing of interest was found. It did, however, argue that the lack of information was still helpful.\nThe three news organizations sued the FBI for the information, following which the agency released 100 pages of documents. However, the fee paid to access the phone was redacted.\nIn the court filings, the organisations said that there was \u201cno adequate justification\u201d for the FBI to continue to withhold the information. They added that they did not seek information that would jeopardise national security.\nThere has been much speculation on the cost of the hack. It was originally suggested that it may have cost as little as $15k, before FBI director James Comey said it cost \u201cmore than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months.\u201d This led to an estimate of $1.3M before the FBI said that it was \u2018less than a million\u2018 but declined to reveal the actual cost.\nImage: TechCrunch",

        "title": "Apple Said to Debut New iPad Pro Lineup, 128GB iPhone SE, and Red iPhone 7 and 7 Plus at March Event",
        "body": "Apple will host a March event to introduce a new iPad Pro lineup and other products, according to Japanese website Mac Otakara.\nIn terms of the iPad Pro lineup, the report claims Apple will announce new 7.9-inch, 9.7-inch, 10.5-inch, and 12.9-inch models. The 10.5-inch model may not ship until May, while the other sizes are said to ship in March.\nIf the report is accurate, it would suggest Apple plans to refresh the iPad mini 4 with a new 7.9-inch iPad Pro model, update its existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models, and introduce an all-new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, which is rumored to feature a narrow bezel design, possibly without a Home button.\nMac Otakara previously said the 10.9-inch iPad Pro\u2014it now says 10.5-inch\u2014will have the same overall footprint as the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro thanks to its narrow bezel design. The earlier report said the top bezel will remain in order to provide space for the front-facing FaceTime camera, but it will likely be slimmer.\nThe blog also previously said the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will feature a 12-megapixel rear camera and True Tone display like the current 9.7-inch model, using advanced four-channel ambient light sensors to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in the surrounding environment.\nMeanwhile, it said the 7.9-inch iPad Pro will feature a Smart Connector, True Tone display, four speakers, and a 12-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera with True Tone flash, as Apple works to standardize features across its tablet lineup. All new iPad Pro models will reportedly gain quad microphones as well.\nThree months ago, Barclays analysts predicted Apple will release a trio of new iPad Pro models in March, including 9.7-inch, 12.9-inch, and edge-to-edge 10.9-inch models, but not a 7.9-inch iPad Pro. Instead, their research note said Apple will continue to produce and sell the iPad mini 4, released in September 2015.\nKGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has likewise said Apple is planning a new 9.7-inch, 10.5-inch, and 12.9-inch iPad Pro lineup for 2017. He did not mention a 7.9-inch model. He said the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch models are likely to feature a faster Apple A10X processor, while the \"low-cost\" 9.7-inch model will sport an A9X chip.\nDigiTimes expects a 10.5-inch iPad Pro as well, making that four separate sources reporting similar. The math checks out too: the width of a 10.5-inch iPad Pro would match the height of the iPad mini screen, while it would have the same resolution as the 12.9-inch model and the same pixel density as the iPad mini.\nToday's report also claims Apple may add a 128GB storage option for the iPhone SE, alongside the smartphone's existing 16GB and 64GB capacities, and add a new red color\u2014(PRODUCT)RED?\u2014option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The blog previously said the red color would be for the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus.\nThe report also calls for new Apple Watch bands at the event in line with last year's Spring refresh. Apple introduced the iPhone SE, 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and new Apple Watch bands at its March 2016 event last year.\nMac Otakara has a good but not perfect track record in terms of Apple rumors.",

The iMac last saw a refresh in October of 2015, more than 500 days ago, while the Mac mini was last updated in October of 2014, over 860 days ago.\n\"Don't think something we've done or something that we're doing that isn't visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere,\" Cook also told investors.\nThere have been no hints that a Mac mini or Mac Pro refresh is on the horizon, but Apple is rumored to be planning to introduce new iMacs in 2017, perhaps as early as March. Future iMacs are expected to be updated with USB-C ports and AMD graphics chips.\nAt the meeting, Cook was also questioned about a potential convergence between the Mac and iPad lines, in the form of a touchscreen Mac. While Cook said he didn't want to comment on future product plans, he again reiterated that he sees the iPad and the Mac as two separate product lines that serve different purposes.\n\"Expect us to do more and more where people will view it as a laptop replacement, but not a Mac replacement - the Mac does so much more,\" he said. \"To merge these worlds, you would lose the simplicity of one, and the power of the other.\"\nMuch of the rest of the shareholder meeting consisted of voting on several proposals and reiterating information that was previously shared during Apple's January earnings call. While no shareholder proposals passed - including those calling for increased diversity and more transparency about donations - Apple reelected its board of directors, approved board compensation, and approved Ernst and Young as the company's accounting firm.",

The new AAPL purchases are part of a $20 billion stock buy the titan has made since just before the November election.\nBuffett has historically shied away from tech sector stocks. In May 2016, Berkshire purchased its first shares of Apple with a 9.81 million share buy which at the time was worth more than $1 billion. The fund increased holdings to the aforementioned 15.2 million AAPL shares in the September quarter\nBerkshire made a series of big Apple buys in the tail end of 2016 with the firm ending 2016 with a significant increase in holdings in the stock since originally getting on board.",

Steve is deeply embedded in the company. We celebrate him and we celebrate his philosophy. His philosophy \u2026 will be at Apple 100 years from now \u2026The philosophy is sort of passed down with every generation \u2026 so yes, he's very much at Apple,\" Cook said.\nThe Apple boss moved onto the topic of Jobs after being asked about the Apple Pencil \u2013 a stylus like device the company released in 2015. Jobs was known for not liking styluses.\n\"Yuck. Nobody wants a stylus, so let's not use a stylus,\" Jobs said during the launch of the first iPhone in 2007.\nCook responded to the question from the audience about why Apple introduced the Pencil, saying that it did not contradict Jobs' thoughts.\n\"The truth is Steve did hate styluses. But if you have ever used the Apple Pencil, the Apple Pencil is the furthest thing from a stylus that has ever existed,\" Cook said.\n\"Designers historically, and many still do, carry sketchbooks \u2026 because they don't know when they're going to have inspiration. And when they have it, you want your tool there \u2026 With Apple Pencil, you have the best of all worlds. Because unlike a sketch that you have to do many times to try out many different looks, whether it's colors or specific lines, etc, with the Apple Pencil, you can quickly try out any number of designs.\"\nCook also used the talk at the University of Glasgow to address President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.

        "body": "A weird little bug has made its way into Apple Music over the last day or so that makes the service randomly skip songs during playback. I first noticed this last night while playing music on my Apple TV, and earlier today on both my iPhone and Mac.\nA quick Twitter search showed that was indeed not the only one in this boat, and after contacting Apple, I have learned that the company is aware of the issue and should fix the problem in the next 72 hours.\nThe symptoms are pretty obvious. While you\u2019re listening to songs that are being streamed from Apple Music, certain tracks will just stop playing at random times and skip to the next song. If you\u2019re lucky, the next song will play in its entirety. If you aren\u2019t, it will just skip at random as well.\nFrom what I could gather, this seems to be a caching issue that prevents the whole track from being cached and stalls the streaming past a certain point. If that is indeed correct, a server side update will likely remedy this.\nThe Apple representative I talked to seemed to indicate this was a widespread problem, and since the company is already aware of it and working on a fix, it should take no more than 72 hours to get fixed.\nIn the meantime, how about giving Tidal a try? jk",

        "body": "Nearly ten years after Apple launched the iPhone, which completely upended the smartphone industry, the device has effectively helped to wipe out one of its major predecessors: the BlackBerry.\nBlackBerry has at last fallen to a rounded 0.0% share among smartphone operating systems after shipping just 207,000 smartphones last quarter, following an over seven year decline from its peak market share of approximately 20% in 2009, according to the latest quarterly data from research firm Gartner.\nThe demise of the smartphone that was once the poster child of Canadian innovation has been a long one in the making, but one that was inevitable now that BlackBerry has shifted its focus to software and sold the global rights to future BlackBerry-branded smartphones to Chinese company TCL Communication.\nBlackBerry actually continued to grow for around two years after the iPhone launched in June 2007, taking market share away from then-leader Nokia. BlackBerry's market share among all smartphone operating systems was 9.6% in 2007, 16.6% in 2008, and 19.9% in 2009, according to Gartner. Then, the decline started.\nBy 2011, the surging popularity of iPhones and Samsung Galaxy smartphones led iOS and Android to leapfrog BlackBerry and Nokia to form a duopoly in the smartphone market that exists to this day. iOS and Android combined for a record 99.6% market share last quarter, according to Gartner.\nWorldwide Smartphone Sales to End Users by Operating System in 4Q16 (Gartner)\nWindows 10 Mobile was the only other platform to make any sort of dent last quarter, recording an insignificant 0.3% market share, according to Gartner. Windows 10 Mobile fell from 1.1% in the year-ago quarter. A group of unnamed \"other\" operating systems captured the remaining 0.1% share.\niOS adoption is still low compared to Android, with the platforms capturing 17.9% and 81.7% worldwide market share respectively in the fourth quarter. iPhones mainly target the premium smartphone market, however, while there are Android-based smartphones at all price points sold by dozens of brands.\nWhat's next for BlackBerry? In addition to focusing on software, the company is also doing self-driving vehicle research, while its rumored \"Mercury\" smartphone by TCL will be unveiled on February 25 at Mobile World Congress.",

        "body": "Apple is inventing new and interesting arguments to prevent you from fixing your iPhone: It's lobbying Nebraska lawmakers to kill \"right to repair\" legislation, telling them unauthorized repair will turn the state into a \"mecca\" for hackers.\nRight to repair bills, which are currently making their way through eight states (Nebraska, New York, Tennessee, Wyoming, Minnesota, Kansas, Illinois, and Massachusetts), would require electronics manufacturers to make repair parts and diagnostic and repair manuals available to independent repair professionals and consumers, not just \"authorized\" repair companies. Electronics right to repair legislation is modeled on a 2012 Massachusetts law that preserved the right to repair cars.\nAdvertisement\nThe most logical reason for manufacturers to oppose the bills is that it would democratize the repair economy, making it possible for consumers to fix their own things and cutting into the profits of repairs done at, for example, the Apple store.\n\"They said that doing this would make it very easy for hackers to relocate to Nebraska.\"\nBut the prospect of a Cupertino-based megacorporation losing business to local repair shops isn't a very sympathetic argument at the Nebraska statehouse. And so Apple has tried a slew of other tactics, according to state Sen. Lydia Brasch, who was recently visited by Steve Kester, an Apple state government affairs specialist.\n\"Apple said we would be the only state that would pass this, and that we would become the mecca for bad actors,\" Brasch, who is sponsoring the bill, told me in a phone call. \"They said that doing this would make it very easy for hackers to relocate to Nebraska.\"\nBrasch, a farmer who also works remotely for a software company in Atlanta, Georgia, has a background in computer science and said Kester wasn't prepared for her to defend the bill she's sponsored.\n\"I think they were surprised to learn I've worked in the technology field the last 15 years even though I'm a farmer,\" she said.\n\"They said just take out the 'phone' part of the bill and we'll go away\"\nRight to repair bills in each state require manufacturers to provide software tools to bypass locks that prevent repair. For example, John Deere tractors contain software that prevent even basic repairs unless \"authorized\" by the company. Last year, a software update to iOS caused Apple's infamous \"Error 53,\" which bricked iPhones that had been repaired by consumers or independent repair shops. Apple did not respond to a request for comment, and Kester, reached by phone, told me he is not authorized to speak to the press.\nAdvertisement\n\"The rationale is that an independent mechanic ought to be able to bypass things like Error 53 that are designed to prevent repair,\" Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, told me. \"If you look, the same exact text is in the Massachusetts auto right to repair law, and it's not causing car thefts or hackers to move to Massachusetts.\"\nKester was joined by Alexi Madon of CompTIA, a trade organization that nominally represents repair professionals (it stewards the A+ computer repair certification) but has, in recent years, partnered with Apple and other electronics manufacturers.\nBrasch said the representatives made two other main arguments: They said repair could cause lithium batteries to catch fire, and said that there are already enough authorized places to get iPhones repaired, such as the Apple store.\n\"When you're talking about safety, there's a greater chance I'll fall down and hit my head. I told them until you have an app that defies gravity, I don't think we have to worry about safety. There's always a risk and there's always a disclaimer,\" she said. \"I have an Apple computer and to get it repaired, I have to bring it to Omaha and I have to make an appointment with a Genius on their schedule. Omaha is 80 minutes from here and there's no Best Buy in a town of 600.\"\nBrasch told me she primarily proposed the legislation because farmers have been inconvenienced by John Deere's \"authorized\" repair requirements, which has taken a self-reliant profession and forced them to get even simple repairs done by John Deere's dealers. But she realizes she's hit a nerve with electronics companies, too.",

        "body": "The so-called \"iPhone 8\" will adopt a higher-cost stacked logic board design to support longer battery life, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nKuo said the stacked logic board, also known as a \"substrate-like PCB mainboard,\" will result in the \"iPhone 8\" with an OLED display having similar dimensions to a 4.7-inch iPhone, yet comparable battery life to a 5.5-inch iPhone. He expects the device to have around a 2,700 mAh L-shaped two-cell battery pack.\nAs battery material tech isn\u2019t likely to see major breakthroughs in the next 3-5 years, mainboard area can only be reduced via stacked SLP, which makes space for larger battery and extended usage time. Thanks to stacked SLP, we expect the OLED iPhone to have similar dimensions to a 4.7\u201d TFT-LCD iPhone, and have comparable battery capacity (equipped with around 2,700 mAh L-shaped 2-cell battery pack) to a 5.5\u201d TFT-LCD iPhone. The battery life of the OLED iPhone could be better than that of the 5.5\u201d TFT-LCD model as OLED panels are more energy-efficient than their TFT-LCD counterparts.\nKuo added that the battery life of \"iPhone 8\" with an OLED display could be better than that of a 5.5\" model with a traditional LCD display, as OLED panels are more energy-efficient than their LCD counterparts.

        "body": "Today Apple announced Self Service Repair will be available June 21 for the iPhone 14 lineup and additional Mac models, including the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro powered by M2. Since April 2022, Self Service Repair has given anyone with experience repairing electronic devices access to the same manuals, genuine Apple parts, and tools used at Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Service Providers.\nApple will also make the System Configuration process used for iPhone repairs, such as displays, batteries, and cameras, even easier to use. System Configuration is a postrepair software tool that ensures repairs with genuine Apple parts \u2014 designed and tested to internationally recognized standards \u2014 were completed correctly, and the parts are working properly. The tool is available for free to all Self Service Repair users and participating service providers in Apple repair programs.\nRunning System Configuration after a repair authenticates genuine Apple parts, updates firmware, and calibrates parts to ensure maximum performance and quality. Additionally, for repairs involving biometric authentication, such as Touch ID or Face ID, System Configuration links the biometric sensors to the Secure Enclave on the logic board to ensure device security and customer privacy.\nSelf Service Repair users can now initiate System Configuration by placing their devices into Diagnostics mode and following onscreen prompts. Users no longer need to contact the Self Service Repair support team to run the final step of a repair, but the team will still be available to assist as needed.\nSelf Service Repair will also be available for the True Depth camera and top speaker for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups \u2014 as well as Mac desktops with M1 \u2014 in the U.S., Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the U.K.\nSelf Service Repair is part of Apple\u2019s efforts to expand access to repairs. Widespread repair access plays an important role in extending products\u2019 longevity, which is good for users and good for the planet. For the vast majority of users who do not have experience repairing electronic devices, visiting a professional authorized repair provider with certified technicians who use genuine Apple parts is the safest and most reliable way to get a repair.\nOver the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training, including more than 4,500 Independent Repair Providers. A global network of more than 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers supports more than 100,000 active technicians.",

        "title": "10.5 and 12.9 iPads not expected to shit until June.",
        "body": "The 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPads that Apple is expected to debut at a March event aren't expected to ship until May or June, supply chain sources tell DigiTimes. An entry-level 9.7-inch iPad, however, is expected to ship within close proximity of the March event.\nIn January, DigiTimes reported that the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPads were expected to enter mass production in the Q2 of 2017 while the 9.7-inch iPad would enter mass production in Q1 2017. The potential release dates partly line up with a recent report from Mac Otakara, which said the 10.5-inch iPad may not be ready to ship until May. However, that report said the three other iPad models rumored to debut at the March event, new 7.9-inch, 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPads, are expected to ship in March.\n12.9-inch iPad shipments have been drying up around the world in recent weeks, slipping to shipping estimates of 2-3 weeks in the United States, Canada, Australia, France, Germany and Japan. While increasing shipping times are a sign of an impending refresh, in this case it seems to be a supply issue.\nDuring Apple's latest earning call, CEO Tim Cook said that the company underestimated iPad demand in the past quarter and had an issue with one of its suppliers. Cook said the issue would probably not be resolved this quarter, likely leading to shriveling 12.9-inch iPad stock. Similarly, the supply issue could keep the refreshed 12.9-inch iPad from shipping before May.\nThe new 10.5-inch model is expected to be the flagship model in Apple's new iPad lineup, sporting an edge-to-edge display on the same footprint as the current 9.7-inch iPad. Alongside new iPads at a March event, Apple is also expected to debut a 128 GB iPhone SE and red iPhone 7 and 7 Plus color variations.",
