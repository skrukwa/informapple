        "body": "The iPhone has become such a major part of our existence, a piece of technology that we almost take for granted, that it\u2019s difficult to remember a time when we were instead tapping away at our Moto Q, Palm Treo and Nokia E62 handsets.\nBut while the iPhone has gone on to revolutionize our lives (and Apple\u2019s business) it\u2019s not that long ago \u2014 eight years today \u2014 that Steve Jobs stood on stage at MacWorld 2007, and told the world that Apple had created a touchscreen iPod, a cell phone, and a breakthrough Internet device all-in-one.\nComing off its most profitable holiday season ever, and a record-breaking week for the App Store, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to rewatch Jobs\u2019 first iPhone presentation: both to see an iconic moment in tech history, and to be reminded of how far we\u2019ve come since then!\nCheck it out after the jump:\nHappy birthday, iPhone!",

        "body": "NBCUniversal today announced that it's debuting a new \"Super Stream Sunday\" promotion, which will allow all U.S.-based users to watch 11 continuous hours of NBC content through the NBCSports.com website and through the NBC Sports Live Extra app on the iPad/iPod touch without the need for a cable subscription.\nSuper Stream Sunday, which starts on February 1 at noon Eastern Time, will include Super Bowl XLIX, the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show with Katy Perry, and the Super Bowl XLIX pre- and post-game shows. It will also feature an episode of The Blacklist.\nAccessing NBC content through NBC.com or within the NBC Sports Live Extra app typically requires a cable subscription and authentication through logging into the service, but for the Super Stream Sunday period, no logins will be required, allowing everyone to watch the Super Bowl for free. NBC is running the promotion in an effort to make people aware of its TV Everywhere offerings, which offer television content on a range of devices with a cable subscription.\nWhile iPad and iPod touch users can watch the Super Bowl using the NBC Sports Live Extra app, NBC is not able to stream content to the iPhone as it does not have NFL live-streaming rights for smartphones due to an exclusive deal the NFL has with Verizon Wireless.\nVerizon Wireless and the NFL plan to introduce a Super Bowl Stadium app that will offer \"exclusive in-stadium video content\" that includes commercials and replays shown from four camera angles. Users not in the United States or Mexico can access the Super Bowl through the NFL's Game Rewind service.\nNBC Sports Live Extra can be downloaded from the App Store for free. [Direct Link]",

        "title": "Samsung's mobile profits plunge 64.2% after Apple's iPhone 6 devastates premium Galaxy sales",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nSamsung Electronics reported overall Q4 operating profits of 5.29 trillion won ($4.9 billion)\u2014 a 36 percent year-over-year drop\u2014 but its Mobile division suffered a 64.2 percent drop in profits, falling from $5 billion in the year ago quarter to $1.8 billion in the December quarter.\nApple's overall operating profits for the quarter were $24.2 billion, up 36.9 percent over the year ago quarter. That means Samsung Mobile is now earning less than 7.5 percent of Apple's profits while still shipping more phone units. Samsung Mobile is now earning less than 7.5 percent of Apple's profits while still shipping more phone units\nApple's net (after tax) profits were $18 billion for the quarter, provisioning $6.4 billion for tax payments. Samsung reported just $230 million in income taxes, an effective tax rate of 4.5 percent.\nApple's effective tax rate is 26.4 percent. Apple pays so much more in taxes that some pundits in 2013 confused Apple's net income with Samsung's operational income, incorrectly reporting that Samsung had earned more than Apple.\nSamsung still hasn't paid Apple the nearly $1 billion judgement it was ordered to pay back in 2012 for patent infringement. However, it reported a $4.79 billion drop in mobile profits last quarter and an additional $3.2 billion decrease in the winter quarter, meaning that $7.2 billion of Samsung's profits have vanished over just the last six months of 2014 compared the same period in 2013.\nProfit contribution from Samsung's smartphones collapsed in half within 2014\nSamsung reported that while its overall sales were only down just slightly more than 11 percent over the year ago quarter, its mobile device revenues were down by 23.2 percent.\nThat was exaggerated into a 64.2 percent drop in mobile profits, because its lost sales where primarily among its higher end Galaxy S and Note product lines where it makes most of its profits.\nThat's a critical problem for the company because most of its profits have been coming from its IT & Mobile Communications (IM) group, which is roughly comparable to Apple's operations. Other divisions of Samsung Electronics include its CE group that sells TVs and appliances (which remained flat year-over-year) and its DS division that includes sales of display panels, semiconductors and memory components (up 4.2 percent over the year ago quarter).\nAt the beginning of 2014, Samsung IM was contributing 70 percent of the company's profits, primarily from smartphone sales, specifically from sales of its higher end Galaxy S and Note devices. Mobile division sales, which also include Samsung's Chromebooks, Windows products and Galaxy Tab tablets, currently account for only 37 percent of the company's profits.\nSamsung notes a black hole in the Galaxy\nThe company's earnings release noted that within the IM group, \"despite slight decline in smartphone shipments QoQ, earnings improved due to efficient cost management and increase in revenue from improved product mix.\"\nSamsung's IM profits were indeed up nearly 12 percent over the previous quarter, when then company described a \"slight growth in shipments\" while seeing its mobile group profits plummet by 73.9 percent.\nThe company noted \"ASP [average selling prices] improved due to increase of high-end product portion, mainly driven by global expansion of [Galaxy] Note 4,\" but in the launch quarter of Samsung's most expensive phone, its financial summary made no comment on the 64.2 percent profit plunge compared to the previous Note 3 launch. $7.2 billion of Samsung's profits have vanished over just the last six months\nIn the previous quarter, Samsung said its phone shipments were \"driven by mid to low-end products,\" adding that its Note 4 release only contributed a \"marginal increase\" due to being released at the very end of the quarter. That makes the company's winter quarter results particularly devastating, because even at the apex of Note 4 sales the flagship phablet wasn't able to reverse the implosion of the company's mobile sales.\nSamsung stated that its \"tablet shipments increased QoQ with Tab4 sales growth,\" but non-phone tablets weren't enough to rescue the quarter's results either. Samsung's tablet business is not very profitable.\nLooking forward over 2015, the company guided, \"expect smartphone competitions to intensify amid the demand growth driven by LTE and emerging market,\" and \"expect tablet growth to continue with mid to low-end demand.\"\nIt also stated that the company has a \"focus on increasing smartphone shipments and securing profitability with new product portfolio.\"\nSpecific to the March quarter, Samsung set expectations low, warning, \"expect decrease in smartphone and tablet demand under weak seasonality\" and said it aimed to \"strive to improve earnings with smartphone shipments growth due to the expansion of A series [middle tier phones], etc.\"\nSamsung's second lowest profits since 2011\nA report by Korea JoongAng Daily noted that the previous quarter had been the first where Samsung had earned less than 5 trillion won since Q3 2011. This quarter, Samsung just exceeded that level with profits of 5.29 trillion won, but the results still remain much lower than any point over the last two years (apart from Q3).\nThe paper cited Lee Se-chul, an analyst at Woori Investment & Securities, as saying \"Samsung's smartphone performance is declining, and as the market is entering a phase of maturity, it is not easy for the company to come up with products differentiated from others.\"",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s next major Mac revealed: the radically new 12-inch MacBook Air",
        "body": "Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apple\u2019s first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.\nThe 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides.\nBesides a new look for the front of the computer, the entire unibody has been revamped from the keyboard to the trackpad to the speakers. Taking cues from the 12-inch PowerBook introduced by Steve Jobs over a decade ago, the new keyboard sits edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop. In addition to going edge-to-edge, the entire key set has been subtly redesigned so that each key sits noticeably closer together. Apple has squeezed the keys closer in order for the computer to be as narrow as possible, which can be seen in the rendition below:\nApple has also relocated some of the function keys across the top and simplified the arrow key array in order to keep the keyboard as narrow as possible without taking away from overall usability. In addition to the keyboard, the trackpad has been changed. The trackpad is approximately the same width as that on the 11-inch MacBook Air (if not ever-so-slightly wider), but it is apparently slightly taller, nearly touching the bottoms of the keyboard and the frame. In line with earlier rumors, it also appears that the new trackpad does not have the same clicking effect as found on current and earlier MacBook models.\nThe elimination of physical feedback in the click is part of Apple\u2019s plan to reduce the thickness of the MacBook to a bare minimum. As can be seen in 9to5Mac artist Michael Steeber\u2018s rendition above, the new 12-inch Air (on the left) is far thinner than the current 11-inch model (on the right). Taking cues from the current Air, the future model has a teardrop-like, tapered design that gets thinner from top to bottom. Above the keyboard are four redesigned speaker grills that actually double as ventilation holes for the fan-less device to keep cool.\nThe upcoming laptop is so thin that Apple employees are said to refer to the device as the \u201cMacBook Stealth\u201d internally. In order to reach that new level of portability, Apple not only slimmed down the trackpad and tweaked the speakers but the ports as well:\nThe upcoming 12-inch Air has the fewest amount of ports ever on an Apple computer, as can be seen in the rendition above. On the right side is a standard headphone jack and dual-microphones for input and noise-canceling. On the left side is solely the new USB Type-C port. Yes, Apple is currently planning to ditch standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and even its Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards on this new notebook. We must note that Apple tests several designs of upcoming products, so Apple may choose to ultimately release a new Air that does include the legacy components, though there is very little space on the edges for them.\nAs we\u2019ve reported on multiple occasions, the new USB Type-C connector is smaller, faster, and more capable than the standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports on existing computers. The connector is able to replace the Thunderbolt Display port on the current Apple laptops as USB Type-C actually has the technology to drive displays. Additionally, the latest specifications from the USB foundation indicate that USB Type-C can actually be used to power computers, which makes the standard MagSafe plugs unnecessary on this new device. The connector is also reversible like Lightning on iPads and iPhones, which should make the overall experience a bit more intuitive.\nAs the new MacBook may only have a single port, it would make sense for Apple to create a hub of some sort for users to be able to plug in multiple devices into the new laptop. Apple already ships all sorts of adapters for its Macs and iOS Devices, so adding yet another attachment to the accessory portfolio would not be unprecedented. With Apple moving to a new \u201cSpace Gray\u201d color on its iOS devices and on some Macs (such as with the 2013 Mac Pro), it seems possible that this new MacBook may come in a new gray color, as shown off in some of our renditions.\nThe latest rumors indicate that the new MacBook Air will ship in mid-2015 (perhaps around WWDC), while other reports have claimed that the new Air is already nearing production. With Intel revealing the latest news on the Broadwell chipset family at CES this week, the ball is likely now in Apple\u2019s court for pushing the future of mobile computing into the world.",

        "title": "What 'MacKeeper' is and why you should avoid it.",
        "body": "It happened again last week.\nA friend was telling me she had convinced her mother to get a Mac laptop.\n\"But what is this MacSweeper?\" she said, with a hint of puzzlement in her voice.\nShe meant, of course, MacKeeper.\nAgain: \"What is it?\"\nA recurring problem\nIn the early days of web browsing, windows containing ads would often pop up randomly and without notice, blocking content on the screen. Annoyed users would have to close these pop-up windows over and over again in an on-going game of whack-a-mole. Then, the very first iteration of Safari included a unique feature: Block Pop-Up Windows. With a simple check box, you could rid yourself this nuisance.\nIn short order, other browsers adopted this feature and all was well with the world....until it resurfaced, largely via new windows or tabs, and we were all back to Square One.\nBut what's been happening of late with these uninvited guests at our browsing parties is a little different. Instead of relatively harmless ads, we're seeing a hard sell by advertisers that uses fear, uncertainty, and doubt to scare users, strongly suggesting that their unprotected Mac is at risk of a virus, or might--horror of horrors--already have one.\nAnd then comes the pitch: Wouldn't you like to download some software or call us right away at the number listed on your screen and buy a service plan to help protect you from evildoers in cyberspace? Or maybe even let us have control of your computer so we can scan and see if your device has already been infected?\nWhile no one can guarantee that your Mac will always be completely safe from viruses and other malware, chances are pretty good that if you are careful and don't fall for scammers' tricks then your Mac won't be impacted.\nThere are lots of entities that are pushing unsuspecting users to download or buy software and services that have been reported to be of questionable value. These aggressive marketing techniques happen in many ways, including phone calls (more on that later).\nMacKeeper is one of these products, and because it seems so prevalent thanks to its extensive on-line advertising campaign, we'll focus on it here. It is a suite of software programs that can securely erase files, perform backups, and other utilities. But some users claim that it slows down their Mac, and many people who accidentally downloaded and installed it now want to remove it.\nHere's how.\nStep 1. MacKeeper's Way\nAccording to MacKeeper's website, the steps are simple: quit the app and drag it to the trash. If you're running an older version of MacKeeper, you may need to remove its menu bar icon first\nFrom the Apple menu, choose Go > Applications. In the window that appears, double-click the MacKeeper icon. From the MacKeeper menu choose Preferences. In the window that appears, click General. Uncheck the box for Show MacKeeper icon in menu bar.\nFrom the MacKeeper menu choose Quit. Drag the MacKeeper app icon from the Applications window to the Trash. Enter an administrator password twice when prompted.\nYour Mac may open a web browser window for a MacKeeper survey that asks you to select a reason for uninstalling the software. It's purely optional.\nStep 2. But you're not done yet...\nLike just about every Mac app, MacKeeper spreads a bunch of support files in several different locations on your computer. Unfortunately, MacKeeper's uninstall process might not remove all of them, particularly if you have an older installation of the app.\nYou can download and install Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware for Mac and have it do the heavy lifting for you, or you can do it by hand as outlined in Step 3 below. If you choose to install Malwarebytes, launch it and do this:\nClick the Scan button. In the sheet that appears, check the box for any software that you would like to delete and click Confirm. (As an aside, PUP stands for Potentially Unwanted Program.)\nOnce the process is finished, restart your Mac.\nIf at some point you want to remove Malwarebytes, there are directions at malwarebytes.com. You will probably also need to follow steps similar to those in Step 3 below to remove all the support files that Malwarebytes installs.\nStep 3. The Manual Way\nEven Malwarebytes may not get all of MacKeeper's supporting files. You should take a look in the Library folder in your home directory to make sure they're all gone. Here's where and how to find them.\nIn the Finder's Go menu, choose Go to Folder.... In the dialog box that appears, type ~/Library and click Go. This will open the Library folder which is normally hidden by default in your home directory. If you find a folder named MacKeeper Backups, drag it to the Trash. Scroll through your Library folder and open the Application Support folder. If you find any files or folders with MacKeeper in its name, drag them to the Trash.\nScroll through your Library folder and open the Caches folder. If you find files named com.mackeeper.MacKeeper, com.mackeeper.MacKeeper.Helper, or any other files or folders with MacKeeper in their name, drag them to the Trash. Scroll through your Library folder and open the LaunchAgents folder. If you find a file named com.mackeeper.MacKeeper.Helper.plist, or any other files or folders with MacKeeper in their name, drag them to the Trash. Your Library folder may contain a folder named LaunchDaemons. If you find inside it a file named com.mackeeper.MacKeeper.plugin.AntiTheft.daemon.plist or any other files or folders with MacKeeper in their name, drag them to the Trash. Scroll through your Library folder and open the Preferences folder. If you find inside it a file named com.mackeeper.MacKeeper.AdwareAnalyzer.plist or any other files or folders with MacKeeper in their name, drag them to the Trash. From the Finder menu, choose Empty Trash... and Empty the Trash if prompted.\nStep 4. If the hits just keep on comin'...\nSometimes installing MacKeeper will result in Safari extensions and cookies also being installed...and the prodding to install MacKeeper\u2014as well as other ads\u2014may keep appearing. The latest version of macOS contains a built-in tool that will remove known unwanted adware and malware when you restart your Mac. So try that first. If that doesn't work, here's what to do.\nFrom the Apple menu, choose Force Quit.... In the window that appears, select Safari and click Force Quit. Relaunch Safari while holding down the Shift key on the keyboard. This will prevent any windows that were open when you force quit Safari from reopening. From the Safari menu, choose Preferences. Click Extensions. In the list that appears, select any extensions that you don't recognize and click Uninstall for each of them. Click Privacy. Click Manage Website Data. In the sheet that appears, enter MacKeeper in the Search box to show any data related to MacKeeper and click Remove All.\nClose the Preferences window and from the Safari menu, choose Quit Safari and restart your Mac.\nPostscript\nYou can take all these steps when it comes to MacKeeper, but even so, aggressive marketing tactics may take a different form. The very morning right before I sat down to write this article, the phone rang at my house.\nA guy named \"Jim\" said his company had been tracking a problem with my computer for several weeks. He breathlessly asked me\u2014a couple of times\u2014to hurry up and turn on my Windows computer and sit down in front of it so he could show me what the problem was before it got any worse.\nMy turn to be aggressive.\n\"Well, James, I know you're lying to me because there isn't a Windows computer in this house. Now please take me off your call list and don't ever call this number again or I will contact the authorities and have you thrown in jail. How does that sound to you?\"\nClick\nMade my day.\nAny questions?\nI put my own Mac at risk in order to help clarify how to uninstall MacKeeper on your Mac, so I've got first-hand experience. If you've installed the program and are still having trouble removing it completely from your Mac, let me know in the comments section and I'll try to help you out.",

Walker-Gaines is being held on $10,000 bond, while Thompson is locked up in lieu of $5000 bond.\nWalker-Gaines (left) and Thompson are pictured in the above mug shots.\nAccording to a criminal complaint, Walker-Gaines confessed that he and Thompson stole the iPad, $5000 in cash, a laptop, and other items from a vehicle owned by Stewart Schaefer, who left the car unlocked in front of his home earlier this month.\nSchaefer subsequently discovered that a series of photos had been uploaded to his iCloud account from the stolen device. Those photos showed Walker-Gaines and Thompson inside a Burger King holding fans of $100 bills.\nThe felony complaint notes that after news about the \u201cselfie\u201d photos began circulating online, a Reddit user contacted a friend of Schaefer\u2019s and provided the names and dates of birth of Walker-Gaines and Thompson.\nIn addition to the photos, Walker-Gaines--whom TSG yesterday identified as one of the thieves--even uploaded a video (seen below) to his Facebook page that showed him holding cash and declaring, \u201cThis, my good people, is what we get from a good night\u2019s hustle.\u201d\nThe video, recorded hours after the theft, was shot inside the Burger King, which is two miles from Schaefer's residence. Schaefer estimated that the items stolen from his truck were worth about $9000.",

        "title": "Just discovered Yosemite has built-in renaming for multiple files",
        "body": "How to Batch Rename Multiple Files in OS X Yosemite\nAs our digital libraries continue to grow, so too has the importance of efficiently managing our data. To this end, Apple has introduced several features in OS X to help users corral their pictures, documents, and other files, such as Spotlight metadata and Finder Tags. Sometimes, however, nothing beats a good file naming scheme. A consistent file name structure, including information such as the date, project, and description, can often be the best way to properly organize and locate digital data. But if you haven\u2019t been applying such a file naming strategy from the get-go, you\u2019ll likely find yourself faced with the daunting task of renaming large numbers of existing files. Thankfully, Apple has recently introduced a new feature in OS X that makes this process much easier.\nPrior to OS X Yosemite, Mac users looking to batch rename files in the OS X Finder would have to turn to third party tools. Renaming single files was simple enough, but if you had to rename multiple files, you\u2019d need apps like Renamer or NameChanger.\nWith OS X Yosemite, however, Apple has integrated basic batch renaming capabilities directly into Finder. To use it, simply highlight or select multiple files in a Finder window, right-click (or Control-click) on the selected items, and choose Rename. Here\u2019s an example to illustrate this process.\nAbove, we have a Finder folder with 20 image files, all named with the original camera naming scheme (IMG_4087, IMG_4088, etc.). That\u2019s not very helpful, and we\u2019d like to rename them with a file name that includes the date they were shot and a brief description. Now, we could always go through and rename each one individually, but that would take a good bit of time, especially for lists of files much larger than the 20 we\u2019re dealing with here.\nInstead, let\u2019s try the new Batch Rename feature in OS X Yosemite. First, we\u2019ll select all of the files we want to rename, which in this case is all of them. Then, right-click (or Control-click) on the selected files and choose Rename 20 Items (the number of items in the context menu will obviously change depending on how many files you\u2019re working with).\nA new window will appear offering some basic options for batch renaming your files. Here\u2019s a brief explanation of each option.\nReplace Text: allows you to find and replace only certain parts of an existing filename. In our example, let\u2019s say we wanted to keep the camera\u2019s numbering scheme, but replace the \u201cIMG\u201d prefix with a description of where the images were shot. We\u2019d therefore enter \u201cIMG\u201d into the Find box, and \u201cBeach\u201d into the Replace with box.\nAdd Text: allows you to add text to the beginning or end of the existing file name. Again returning to our example, we could keep the existing camera file name, but just add the date at end. We\u2019d therefore enter 20140710 in the text filed and select after name from the drop-down menu.\nFormat: this is what most people envision when they think about batch file renaming. This option lets you get rid of the original file name entirely and replace it with your own. Options include creating a custom name with a numbered sequence (Name and Index), a custom name with a counter (Name and Counter), and a custom name with the date (Name and Date). In each case, you can choose to place the counter, sequence, or date before or after the custom name.\nIn our case, we\u2019d like the date, but don\u2019t want the timestamp that accompanies the automatic date application in the Name and Date option. So we\u2019ll choose Name and Index, which lets us put the date in manually in the exact desired format.\nThat means that we\u2019ll enter \u201c20140710-Beach-\u201d in the Custom Format box, and tell Finder to append the index number after the file name. Note that we include the extra dash after \u201cBeach\u201d in our custom name so that the index number is separated from the description. Without it, the number would be appended directly after \u201cBeach.\u201d You can also use spaces in the same way by simply including an extra space at the end of your custom name. As you fiddle with your naming scheme, Finder will helpfully show you an example preview of what the files will look like at the bottom of the window.\nWhen you\u2019re all set with your desired batch rename, just click Rename to apply the changes. You\u2019ll now find that all of your files have the new name and sequence, saving you the time and hassle of renaming them by one-by-one.\nLongtime users of third party batch renaming tools will recognize that the new batch rename features in OS X Yosemite are relatively basic. Third party tools still offer more features and capabilities, and power users will likely want to stick with existing renaming solutions offered by the Terminal and Automator. But for everyone else with basic renaming needs, OS X Yosemite and Finder are all you need.",

        "title": "Apple sold a record 74.5 million iPhones during the last quarter",
        "body": "Apple today announced financial results for the first fiscal quarter of 2015, which corresponds to the fourth calendar quarter of 2014. For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of $74.6 billion and net quarterly profit of $18 billion, or $3.06 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $57.6 billion and net quarterly profit of $13.1 billion, or $1.98 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.\nGross margin for the quarter was 39.9 percent compared to 37.9 percent in the year-ago quarter, with international sales accounting for 65 percent of revenue. Apple also declared an upcoming dividend payment of $0.47 per share, payable on February 12 to shareholders of record as of February 9. The company currently holds $178 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nApple sold a record 74.5 million iPhones during the quarter, up from 51 million a year earlier, while Mac sales were also strong with 5.5 million units sold, up from 4.8 million units in the year-ago quarter. iPad sales were down, however, falling to 21.4 million from 26 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to thank our customers for an incredible quarter, which saw demand for Apple products soar to an all-time high,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cOur revenue grew 30 percent over last year to $74.6 billion, and the execution by our teams to achieve these results was simply phenomenal.\u201d\nApple's guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 includes expected revenue of $52-55 billion and gross margin between 38.5 and 39.5 percent.\nApple will provide live streaming of its fiscal Q1 2015 financial results conference call at 2:00 PM Pacific, and MacRumors will update this story with coverage of the conference call highlights.\nConference Call and Q&A Highlights are available in reverse chronological order after the jump.\n3:00 pm: The call is complete.\n3:00 pm: A: Each is a different implementation. In some ways there's a different set of carriers in every country. Different set of banks in every country. Processes with merchants are different. It's an area where there's quite a bit of difference country-to-country. Heavy lifting to scale, but nothing preventing us from viewing it as a big opportunity.\n2:59 pm: Q: Apple Pay opportunity outside the US, are there unique hurdles in Europe and Asia or is it about pulling partnerships together?\n2:59 pm: A: At this point, we don't have all of our research in from all of the people that bought last quarter yet. In aggregate, we saw more new customers to iPhone than we'd ever seen before. We had higher rate of Android switchers than we had in three previous launches. I don't know before that. Between switchers and the people that are just new to smartphones and selected an iPhone and our upgrades which we're very happy with but represent a small fraction of the install base, we feel really good about what's in front of us.\n2:58 pm: Q: iPhone 6 Plus brought you into a new segment of the market. You mentioned difference in geographic and Android switchers. What do you think this tells you about ASP and unit opportunity?\n2:57 pm: Investing in the business, will never underinvest in the business. Majority of increase will come from R&D, expanded product portfolio, making investments ahead of revenue that will be generated in the future. Invest in marketing and advertising, expanding distribution, taking our brand to more places. Continue to open new retail stores around the world. The idea for us is to continue to invest in the business. Making right trade offs. Results from December quarter give us very good confidence for the future.\n2:56 pm: A: Guidance for upcoming quarter only: Guidance for March quarter, guiding to growth in OpEx year over year that is similar to what we've experienced during December quarter. We obviously feel good about business during December, revenue exceeded our growth in OpEx. Going to be quarters where opposite is going to happen. Our expense to revenue ratio during December was 7.4%, was lowest that we've had in two years. Among the lowest ratios that we've ever had.\n2:55 pm: Q: Detail on expectations on OpEx going forward, investing in new product but how should that trend over the next few quarters.\n2:55 pm: A: If you look at Fortune 500 as an example, we're in essentially all Fortune 500 companies. Issue is not a market share number. Market share is extremely high. Issue is that enterprises generally are only deploying iPads to a small percentage of their workforce. Real opportunity is to bring mobility into the Enterprise and change how people work. In order to do that, need apps that are written to specific jobs. Not just apps that are general productivity like word processors and spreadsheets. That's one of the things that working with IBM provides us. That and the knowledge of the verticals which they bring a significant amount of knowledge on all the verticals that I mentioned earlier. Where can we take that to? I think that if we can change the way people work, the opportunity is enormous. Not hanging numbers out there to be measured on at this point. We don't do a lot of big partnerships. When we do one, it is significant and it is because we really believe in it. We really believe in this one and what it can do for customers.\n2:53 pm: Q: When you think about iPad and IBM partnership, can you talk about penetration on iPad in enterprise and how do you see that improve in the next quarter as you roll out more modules with IBM?\n2:53 pm: A: Net impact AFTER hedges. Impact without hedges would be larger.\n2:52 pm: Q: Gross margin side, 100 basis points of headwind that you're talking about in march, there's still some protection on hedges or raw number?\n2:52 pm: Worth pointing out that there are markets where we can't hedge. Cost is prohibitive or financial instruments are just not there to hedge. That's where you get full impact of the volatility.\n2:52 pm: A: Typically we have an active hedging program. In the market almost every day. Tend to hedge 3-12 months out. Cases where we tend to go a bit longer. If we feel that we have a strong conviction about certain currencies. Typical period is 3-12 months. As hedges roll off, we replace them with new hedges. Take into account exposure that we have around the world, our most recent forecasts. Hedge accordingly. Feel very good about hedging position and decisions that we've made particularly during the summer. Maybe we need to hedge a bit more than we have done historically.\n2:51 pm: Q: Duration of hedge contracts and renewal pattern? What's typical renewal and will you be accelerating that?\n2:50 pm: Those groups are there, very excited about all of them. Serving all of them.\n2:50 pm: A: Small fraction. A number that's in the mid-teens, barely. So, I say that there's an enormous amount left. Given there are a fair amount of android units out there, also an enormous number of Android customers that could switch. Also remind you that there's a lot of people who have yet to buy a smartphone. Doesn't feel like that in the US, from a worldwide point of view there are a lot of them.\n2:49 pm: Q: Small number of user base who have updated to iPhone 6 or Plus. How many of base have upgraded? Pattern of upgrade? Are they older or is it a good spread?\n2:49 pm: We were able to get this in a lot of merchants and I give them a lot of credit for that. This is the year of Apple Pay. Some of the things you mentioned and others, all things that we are looking at and in many cases working on.\n2:48 pm: On Apple Pay, contactless payment and in app are both important. Will play out different in different geographic regions with which is bigger. Mix will change over time. More commerce will flow across apps and so forth. In terms of how it evolves, we're in the first inning on it. Haven't completed first inning. Tons of things on our road map of adding functionality to it. Just in US right now, tons of countries to go to. Not a day that goes by that I don't get notes from many businesses outside the US wanting Apple Pay. Banks and merchants. Still have merchants in the US, but have to tell you that given that we launched in October, I'm unbelievably positively shocked at how many merchants were able to implement Apple Pay in the heart of their holiday season.\n2:47 pm: A: On Apple TV, we had solid quarter with existing product. Sold 25 million Apple TV in total. It's something that we continue to look at and work on and find a way that we can make a greater contribution than what we're doing.\n2:46 pm: Q: First, any update on Apple TV or broader vision in the living room? Apple Pay, outlined successes at point of sale. In-app is important? How important is that? How could product grow over time? Consumer to consumer?\n2:46 pm: Just shipped new phone a few months ago. Things like that are going on. On the other side, partnership with IBM and work that we have going on in the Enterprise is profound. Really going to change the way people work. Excited about the apps that are coming out. How fast the partnership is getting up and running, can move the dial there. Not predicting 90 day clips and so forth, but long arc of time, I really believe that iPad is a great space, a great product, and with the great product innovation we've got, there's a very bright future for it.\n2:45 pm: Usage is 6x our nearest competitor. Usage as measured in web browsing is 71% of total tablets. Also, commerce taking place across the iPads is enormous. Essentially over 80% of commerce on tablets is on iPad. When I back up and look at all of these, I believe that over the long arc of time, the iPad is a great business. I also have visibility to what's in the pipeline and feel very very good about that. Not projecting something very different next quarter or the next. Thinking over the long run. In terms of what I think is going on, what you said is absolutely true. Upgrade cycle is longer, it's longer than an iPhone. Probably between an iPhone and a PC. Not in the business long enough to say that with certainty. Some level of cannibalization with Mac on one side and phone on the other. A little bit of that that is shaking out. How much? Hard to tell.\n2:44 pm: A: Optimistic and bullish on iPad. Measured in 90 day clips as we do, in the short run I don't think you'll see a miraculous change in YoY. But, here's what I see and the reason I'm so optimistic. First time buyer rates are very high. I mean, some developed markets like US, Japan, UK, you would find that 50% of people are buying an iPad for the first time. Look in China, it's over 70%. That kind of first time buyer rates, you don't have a saturated market. Customer sat on iPad, literally off the charts, in some cases 100%. Unheard of.\n2:42 pm: Q: iPad... you've spoken on prior calls about your enthusiasm for the product. Down double digits from unit perspective and ASP is declining. Comment on whether your bullishness about the iPad persists. Do you believe that it's a replacement cycle that we will see that will drive growth, or is the innovation and product that's necessary and forthcoming that's coming?\n2:42 pm: A: Correct.\n2:42 pm: Q: Sequentially saying it's about a 2 point incremental headwind on FX?\n2:41 pm: Fact that last year in January, we launched China Mobile and subsequent channel fill that will not repeat. Also had very strong quarter in Japan in March a year ago, driven by very significant carrier promotional activities. Pull forward of sales into March in anticipation of a consumption tax increase that took place on April 1. Not gonna repeat. Take those factors into account, that explains the sequential decline that we see this year. 20% year over year growth though.\n2:41 pm: A: It is a 20% year over year growth that we're guiding to top end. Feel good about 20% growth. As we look at it on a sequential basis, a couple of things to note. FX headwinds, they are there, we need to deal with them, but they are obviously a negative to revenue. Headwinds we have this year that were not there a year ago. We've also said, manufacturing ramp that we've had this year in December quarter has been fastest that we've ever had. Also a factor that impacts the sequential compare. Then there's a couple of specific events that happened last year in March that are not going to repeat\n2:39 pm: Q: Comment on your revenue guidance, Luca as you mentioned range is down 26-30% sequentially. Look back over last 3-4 Q1-Q2, revenues decline in more 15-20% range. As you noted iPhone channel inventory is below target range as well, so wondering if you can discuss what factors are contributing to steeper than normal decline this quarter.\n2:39 pm: Incredible market, people love Apple products, we are going to do our best to serve the market.\n2:39 pm: A: Local competition was there this quarter and has been there for many quarters before. Local competition isn't new. I think we did really well there, very proud of how we're doing. Was there right after launch in October and excitement around 6 and 6 Plus was phenomenal. Can see that in the results with mainland China up 100% year on year. Can tell that we're a big believer in China. Growing number of stores. 20 soon and doubling that by mid-2016. Growing channel there, online store has expanded to over 350 cities now, online revenues in China last quarter were more of sum of previous 5 years.\n2:37 pm: Q: In terms of China, how do you feel the momentum is in terms of sustainability vs local competition as you navigate that market specifically?\n2:37 pm: Basically when we thought. Most importantly, we're thrilled to start shipping it. Customers want it.\n2:37 pm: Just to clarify, what we've been saying was Early 2015 and we sort of look at the year and think of Early as first four months, mid is middle four months and late is final four months. It's sort of within the range.\n2:36 pm: A: My expectations are very high on it, I'm using it every day. I love it and I can't live without it. I see that we're making great progress on development of it. Number of developers that are writing apps for it are impressive. Seeing some incredible innovation coming out there.\n2:36 pm: Q: Asking about Apple Watch, shipping in April. Month or two later than you said originally. What's going on with that product in terms of timing and excitement for it? A little more color on other apps that could be available at launch? Any expectations?\n2:35 pm: 38.5-39.5, feel that's very good about where we are in the cycle.\n2:35 pm: A: More favorable costs in March vs December. FX headwinds as I was explaining, they will be sequential a headwind of more than 100BP. Exclude that FX impact, we would be guiding to sequential increase in margin. Other element that is there is seasonal, is loss of leverage from Q1 into Q2 when you look at revenue guidance. 26-30% less revenue, loss of leverage.\n2:34 pm: Q: Typically enjoy cost product drops as you move through product cycle. Anything other than FX that keeps you from ramping GM over the year?\n2:34 pm: Entered quarter with quite a bit of momentum.\n2:34 pm: We're appealing to new customers, both new to smartphones and new to iPhone and people switching. Getting great feedback about the quality of the products we're shipping. Very bullish. Emerging markets, the growth was absolutely stunning. Brazil, mainland China, more than doubled year over year. A 3-4x what those markets were doing according to IDC.\n2:33 pm: A: You can see from the March guidance that we've given that we're bullish about iPhone going forward. We believe that it's the best smartphone in the world, our customers are telling us that, the market is telling us that. We're doing well in virtually every quarter of the world. Very bullish that it has legs. Only a small fraction of the installed base has upgraded. A lot more people within the installed base. Also point out that we had the highest number of customers new to iPhone than in any prior launch. Current iPhone lineup experienced highest Android switcher rate than any 3 previous years.\n2:32 pm: Q: Can you talk about how you think about sustainability of this very strong iPhone demand into 2015? Particularly given that most carriers had access to that product during the quarter?\n2:31 pm: At end of quarter, we were within target range of channel inventory on iPad. In terms of growing channel inventory, in particular on iPhone where we're outside of it, we wouldn't expect to see a large step function increase. We would expect it to occur more gradually over time than sort of an all at once type of thing. But we don't guide to channel inventory as you know.\n2:30 pm: Just recently we became in supply demand balance on 6 and 6 Plus in January. Not able to reach a balanced state during Fiscal Q1. On iPad, we increased channel inventory by 1.1 million units from beginning of the quarter, that compares to previous year where we increased to 2.1. That was required because of new products we announced.\n2:30 pm: A: iPhone point of view, our channel inventory decreased from beginning of the quarter by 200k units. Outside the 5-7 week target range on the low end.\n2:29 pm: Q: Sellthrough relative to reported numbers for iPhone and iPad, and increase channel inventory.\n2:29 pm: A: We don't report out precise mix but I can tell you that iPhone 6 was most popular iPhone last quarter. Obviously to sell 74.5 million, they were really all popular. All did well, clearly a geographic preference difference where some geos would skew higher on preference to 6 Plus than other geos. Not consistent around the world. Both did incredibly well. Really proud of them along with the iPhone 5s and c as well. Continue to be in the lineup.\n2:28 pm: Q: Address mix of iPhone 6 line, how did the 6 Plus do? Relative to total units, geographic skew, and availability?\n2:28 pm: A: I think as you know, we prefer to adjust local pricing at the time of new product launches. That's our preference. When currencies move as much as they have in places like Russia, sometimes we need to take mid-cycle action to realign pricing. So we'll see what happens. As you know, currency markets are very volatile and we want to understand a bit better what is happening.\n2:27 pm: Q: Talk a little bit about pricing power? As you think about currency and euro movements, then the contracts you have with carriers, talk about opportunities to raise prices?\n2:27 pm: It goes without saying, a strong US dollar has a negative impact on our international business. We have provided what we believe is very strong guidance. Remain confident about portfolio of services in the market today.\n2:26 pm: In terms of gross margins, we look at gross margin on sequential basis, gross margin percentage after the offset from the hedging program will be impacted by more than 100 basis points. Now, having said that, we have factored the impact that I just described into the guidance that we provided to you. That's where we are right now. Looking further out, we don't provide guidance past March but at current levels, again those headwinds will continue to become stronger for the reasons I explained earlier. Our hedges continue to expire.\n2:25 pm: What that means to us going forward for the March quarter is that revenue growth on a year over year basis in constant currency would be 5 points higher than what we are guiding to if not for FX movements.\n2:25 pm: Our hedging program partially mitigated the volatility, but as we look forward into the March quarter, FX headwinds will be stronger in Q2 than in Q1 for two main reasons. Fact that the US dollar has continued to appreciate against foreign currencies during last few weeks, and that our existing hedges expire, get replaced by new contracts at current levels, so the protection that's provided to us by hedging diminishes over time.\n2:24 pm: A: Q1 and what we're looking for in Q2 and maybe even further. What we've seen during Q1 is unprecedented movements in currencies. During the quarter, the biggest impact came from the Japanese Yen, Russian Ruble, but also from Euro, Australian and Canadian Dollar. Revenue growth during Q1 would have been 4 percentage higher on a constant currency basis.\n2:23 pm: Q: Talk about currency? How are you thinking about it? What it does to gross margin? What it's going to do during the year?\n2:23 pm: Questions starting:\n2:23 pm: Dividend of $0.47 per share, payable on 2/12 to shareholders as of 2/9.\n2:23 pm: Gross margin between 38.5 and 39.5%.

        "title": "Apple Passes Nikon to Become Second Most Popular Camera Brand on Flickr",
        "body": "Flickr over the weekend released data detailing the most popular camera rankings of 2014 for the online photo sharing service. With 100 million users uploading 10 billion photos last year, the usual standouts of Canon and Nikon edged out most of the competition, but most interesting was Apple moving past Nikon to take second place in the rankings (via The Next Web).\nFocusing solely on the top 5 camera brands used on the service last year, Canon took first place with 13.4 percent, followed by Apple with 9.6 percent and Nikon with 9.3 percent. Samsung and Sony round out the other top spots.\nIndividual iPhone models have long registered as the most popular camera devices on Flickr, but in looking at overall brand performance, major traditional camera manufacturers Canon and Nikon with as many as several hundred different models on the market long held down the top spots until Apple's entry in 2014.\nFlickr also looked at the top mobile device cameras used on Flickr, where Apple unsurprisingly dominated the top ten list. In first through fourth were the iPhone 5 (10.6 percent), iPhone 4s (7.0 percent), iPhone 4 (4.3 percent), and the iPhone 5c (2.0 percent). The iPhone 6, iPad, and iPad mini also placed in the top ten. It is unclear why the iPhone 5s is not included on Flickr's year-end lists, as it has been registering as the most popular camera overall for a number of months now.\nThough Flickr's data can't exactly be used to specifically track the rise or fall of full-fledged DSLR and professional cameras, as Flickr is used by both paid professionals and everyday amateurs, it's still interesting to see Apple's own hardware slowly edge out such big brands in the photography space.",

        "title": "Pushbullet for iOS and OSX is finally here!",
        "body": "This past year marked a monumental step forward for the Apple ecosystem. Extensions brought inter-app conectivity to iOS. Yosemite brought the design of iOS to a new peak with beautiful blurs, a minimalist focus on content, and continuity. These are the tools we\u2019re using to build something amazing at Pushbullet.\nPushbullet connects your devices in ways no one has imagined. Seeing your phone\u2019s notifications on your computer and copying and pasting across devices make your devices feel like one. For some, however, this functionality has been missing. Today, we\u2019re excited to share with you our biggest launch ever.\nSee our new apps in action here:\nDemo video\nShare Anything, Anywhere\nShare extensions are the most exciting feature of iOS 8 for us at Pushbullet. You can now send files, links, photos, and anything else without leaving your current app. No more copying links and then opening Pushbullet to share. What\u2019s more, you can even send multiple files at once - try it from the Photos app, its awesome!\nAbuses of this photobombing power are left as an excercise for the reader, but cute pet pictures are a good place to start.\nShare extensions are great for files, but sometimes the app you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t work with them. Sometimes you just want an easy way of bringing text or a link from your mobile to your computer, or vice-versa. With Universal Copy & Paste, you don\u2019t even have to think about, you just paste. It doesn\u2019t get easier than that.\nBigger than iPhone 6+\nHaving Pushbullet on your phone is great, but you should be able to use Pushbullet everywhere so we made Pushbullet work great on iPad too. This lets you enjoy all of your pushes on your favorite device. Need to share a link or file while your\u2019re browsing reddit working? You\u2019ll now be able to use our share extension and Universal Copy & Paste on iPad too.\nA Trip to Yosemite, Pushbullet Edition\nThe Pushbullet Mac App is now availble free in the Mac App Store. With our Mac app, you can send files and view notifications at any time. You can also view your pushes and filter them by channel, friend, or device. You can also drag-and-drop files on to the app itself or the dock icon to easily push them.\nMirror, mirror, on the \u2026 Mac\nWe\u2019ve been asked time and time again to bring notification mirroring to iOS. Seeing mobile notifications on desktop is really quite magical. Using Bluetooth LE, you can now see, act on, and dismiss your iOS notifications right on your Mac. Your notifications will stay synced with your phone.\nWalk away from your computer? Your notifications leave with you, no longer visible on your desktop, keeping them private. Want to control what notifications you see at work, versus when you\u2019re at home? No problem. Your notification settings are per installed Mac app, so you have total control over what you see, and where you see it. There\u2019s even first class support for Android notifications too.\nAll Pushbullet, All the time\nWant to close the desktop app, but still want to get updates from Pushbullet? No problem. Close away. You can push at any time from the menulet app in the top bar. You can even view your recent pushes and notifications, right there or in Notification Center.\nSafari Has Joined The Party Too\nOur new Safari extension makes sending links to your phone a snap. You can click on our extension icon, or simply just right-click on a link or the page to send it to any of your devices.\nA New Frontier\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to bring an amazing Pushbullet experience to iOS and OS X. There are a lot of delightful details in the apps that we hope you enjoy, and this is just the beginning.\nWe\u2019d like to welcome you to the beginning of Pushbullet for Apple, and say thank you for your support. For those of you who are just joining us\u2026\nPS: You can now sign in with Facebook everywhere.",

        "title": "Apple has lost the functional high ground",
        "body": "Apple\u2019s hardware today is amazing \u2014 it has never been better. But the software quality has fallen so much in the last few years that I\u2019m deeply concerned for its future. I\u2019m typing this on a computer whose existence I didn\u2019t even think would be possible yet, but it runs an OS with embarrassing bugs and fundamental regressions. Just a few years ago, we would have relentlessly made fun of Windows users for these same bugs on their inferior OS, but we can\u2019t talk anymore.\n\u201cIt just works\u201d was never completely true, but I don\u2019t think the list of qualifiers and asterisks has ever been longer. We now need to treat Apple\u2019s OS and application releases with the same extreme skepticism and trepidation that conservative Windows IT departments employ.\nGeoff Wozniak went back to desktop Linux after almost a decade on OS X (Update: He appears to have taken the post down). It\u2019s just one person\u2019s story, but many of his cited reasons resonate widely. I suspect the biggest force keeping stories like this from being more common is that Windows is still worse overall and desktop Linux is still too much of a pain in the ass for most people. But it should be troubling if a lot of people are staying on your OS because everything else is worse, not necessarily because they love it.\nApple has always been a marketing-driven company, but there\u2019s a balance to be struck. Marketing plays a vital role, but marketing priorities cannot come at significant expense to quality.\nI suspect the rapid decline of Apple\u2019s software is a sign that marketing1 is too high a priority at Apple today: having major new releases every year is clearly impossible for the engineering teams to keep up with while maintaining quality. Maybe it\u2019s an engineering problem, but I suspect not \u2014 I doubt that any cohesive engineering team could keep up with these demands and maintain significantly higher quality.2\nThe problem seems to be quite simple: they\u2019re doing too much, with unrealistic deadlines.\nWe don\u2019t need major OS releases every year. We don\u2019t need each OS release to have a huge list of new features. We need our computers, phones, and tablets to work well first so we can enjoy new features released at a healthy, gradual, sustainable pace.\nI fear that Apple\u2019s leadership doesn\u2019t realize quite how badly and deeply their software flaws have damaged their reputation, because if they realized it, they\u2019d make serious changes that don\u2019t appear to be happening. Instead, the opposite appears to be happening: the pace of rapid updates on multiple product lines seems to be expanding and accelerating.\nUpdate: I regret the attention this got, as it wasn\u2019t my best work.",

        "body": "Happy New Year. And when it comes to shopping in Japan, that means sales and fukubukuro. These \"lucky bags\" are sold by all kinds of stores, and typically contain products equal in value to what you pay, but sometimes a whole lot more. Even Apple's bricks-and-mortar stores have followed the tradition since 2004, with a handful of bags housing a coveted MacBook Air. All of the bags cost 35,000 yen, roughly $300, but if you're shopping for an Apple laptop, it's a gamble. There's no guarantee what will be inside yours. This year, for the first time, Apple has added a handful of limited edition products for its crowd of dedicated Japanese fans. We visited the store in Ginza, Tokyo, today, which alone (there are three stores in the city) managed to attract 900 people before the store even opened. Let's see what 300 bucks can buy, if you're willing to risk it.\nGallery: Apple's Lucky Bag event 2015 | 14 Photos\n/14 Gallery: Apple's Lucky Bag event 2015 | 14 Photos\n/14\nLucky bags are a Japanese retail tradition that began at the Matsuya Ginza department store -- which conveniently stands directly across the street from the Apple Store. The first bags apparently went on sale in the late 1800s: Take that Black Friday. This year, Apple's bags aren't the paper variety, but a limited edition InCase laptop backpack (15,800 yen, roughly $130). Limited edition items also include Mophie Juice Packs, a speaker unit and laptop cases adorned with the same origami print of the lucky backpack.\nMost bags included the battery pack, as well as a pair of wireless Beats headphones. The rest of the contents, well, vary. If you're not so lucky, you'll find a 16GB Product Red iPod touch. From there it rolls through to the latest iPad mini and iPad Air models. If your bag is particularly lucky (and we saw three), then you could find an 11-inch MacBook Air. That's 88,800 yen worth of luck. (Or around $730.) According to Japanese Apple blog Macotakara, these were the four patterns for the bags. We managed to see second-in-line Yon (a lucky bag regular) get his bag, which housed an 11-inch MacBook Air alongside a cover case and travel adapter.\nAfter leaving the store to write up how the madness went down, this editor discovered a friend in the queue. Nothing quite like the emotional roller coaster of a lucky bag, right? So we asked Masa to take us through it all. He was customer number 1,035, according to his entry card, and the line for lucky bags closed almost immediately after him. He was hoping for an iPad mini -- the bag was (kinda tragically) a Christmas present to himself, so we were hoping that his gamble would pay off. After handing over the money (around $300), he was ushered to a table that had the remaining bags on display. The nature of lucky bags ensures the contents are pretty random. The staff doesn't know what's in them, and Apple doesn't offer up a specific number of bags that'll go for sale, or the number of MacBooks hiding within.\nSubscribe to the Engadget Deals Newsletter Great deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget\u2019s editorial team.

Let's take a look.\nStarting with the limited edition backpack, (15,800 yen), there was also:\nPower Beats 2 Wireless headphones (20,600 yen)\nApple TV (9,800 yen)\niPod touch 16GB (20,800 yen)\nMophie powerstation (8,800 yen)\niTunes credit (unknown value)\nNo iPad. But such is the life of a lucky bag shopper. However, racking up the retail prices of the contents totals 75,800 yen (around $630 dollars), far in excess of the 35,000 yen paid for it. That said, my friend was... disappointed. The bags offer up a great value, as long as you're happy with the contents. Lucky bags are likely going to remain a Japan-exclusive. (Apple Japan said it doesn't comment on future plans.) Would you take the risk?",

        "title": "A history of the \uf8ff, \u2318 and \u2325 keys",
        "body": "You can date an Apple user as accurately as a botanist counting rings to date a tree, and you don\u2019t even have to cut them in half first.\nWhat you do is work out what they call the Mac\u2019s secondary modifier key. This is trickier to do than you might think, as evidenced by how I had to come up with that awkward description rather than name it myself and so skew your response.\nTo a modern Mac user, you see, it\u2019s the Alt key. To a more seasoned veteran, it\u2019s Option, and to the true keepers of the flame, it\u2019s the Closed Apple key.\nIt\u2019s always fun, incidentally, watching people get one-upped when they try to pull the Mac old-timer card. You know the kind of thing I mean; someone posts to a forum saying that while they know how to type an acute accent on a Mac by tapping Alt-E, they\u2019d like to know how to get an umlaut. The reply comes that they should tap Alt-U, and by the way it\u2019s not actually called the Alt key, it\u2019s called Option. But then, as sure as night follows day, it\u2019s followed by someone pointing out that it was actually originally called the Closed Apple key and by the way that diacritical mark was originally called a di\u00e6resis not an umlaut, followed by the second guy pointing out that the original poster had asked about typing the symbol on a Mac and since the Closed Apple convention predated the Macintosh he was quite right to have said it was originally called Option, and so on and so on until the heat death of the universe. I do love a pedant; they\u2019re my people.\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning, so that you too can have heated, detailed, and highly pointless arguments about Apple modifier keys on the internet.\nEven most manual typewriters have a modifier key\u2014one you press in conjunction with other keys to change their function\u2014though of course in the case of a typewriter usually the sole modifier key is Shift. After all, there\u2019s not much else you can do with a typewriter save tap at the keys to punch out letters. With computers, though, you can do so much more, so instead of letting keyboards spawn hundreds of extra keys\u2014one each for copy, cut, paste, one each for \u00e9, \u00e8, \u00eb, \u00ea and so on\u2014modifier keys were quite literally pressed into service.\nThere are four main modifier keys on today\u2019s Macs: Control, Option, Shift and Command. (And in fact you might have noticed that that\u2019s the correct order for the keys to be listed when they\u2019re shown in menus, according to Apple\u2019s official style guide, so for example the Duplicate command in Finder is \u2325\u21e7\u2318S.)\nBut it wasn\u2019t always thus. The first Apple computer had only one besides Shift, the venerable Control key. The Apple IIe and III\u2019s keyboards, though, added two different Apple keys as additional modifiers; one was called the Open Apple key which bore an outline of the Apple logo and which was analogous to today\u2019s Command key, and the other was the Closed Apple key, a filled-in Apple symbol silhouette whose role was more like today\u2019s Alt key. Before the Macintosh, the Command symbol we\u2019re familiar with today\u2014that \u201clooped square\u201d symbol on the key to the left and right of the space bar on modern systems\u2014didn\u2019t exist. Or at least, it didn\u2019t exist outside Nordic cartography. Famously, it was Steve Jobs who put an end to the proliferation of Apple symbols not just on the keyboard but all over the interface, and the Mac gained a new symbol for its primary modifier key, \u2318.\nWell, I say \u201cput an end to,\u201d but things are never that clear-cut. With the Apple IIGS, Apple also introduced ADB, its now-old connection for input devices, but because ADB would be used for the Mac as well, the primary modifier key on Apple keyboards would have both the new \u2318 symbol and the old Open Apple symbol on them to allow them to control both the old and new systems. That weird and potentially confusing state of affairs continued for a couple of decades, but in 2007 Jobs\u2019 vision was finally realized and the Apple symbol was removed for good. In its place, on U.S. keyboards, the word Command joins the \u2318, while in Europe it\u2019s Cmd.\nOne little coda: you might never really have thought about the \u2325 symbol before, the symbol that replaced the Closed Apple, but if you look at it, it clearly represents an \u201calternate\u201d route, or the idea of one option take over another. Read it left to right, as we read English and many other languages, and you see a line which would continue straight, but it\u2019s been diverted, a little bit like a train crossing over a set of points, to an alternate route lower down.",

Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nAfter a brief hiatus, Apple's high-capacity 2TB Mac mini has returned to the Online Apple Store on Tuesday, but is once again reserved as a configuration option on the most expensive $999 model.\nWhen the latest Mac mini refresh was introduced last October, AppleInsider noted Apple had axed internal storage options beyond 1TB. Prior to the hardware update, a 2TB HDD was offered as an add-on to the top-end Mac mini server, which was also discontinued.\nIn its return to the Online Apple Store, spotted earlier today, the 2TB Mac mini is now a Fusion Drive unit, but is again restricted to the highest-end $999 model, which comes with a 2.8GHz dual-Core Intel Core i5 1TB Fusion Drive and 8GB of memory, standard. The additional storage space comes at a $100 premium and \u2014 aside from swapping to an 256GB SSD \u2014 is the cheapest storage upgrade available.",

        "title": "The opposite of Apple: A Mac user's weird experience buying a PC laptop",
        "body": "So, I bought a PC.\nLike a lot of long-time Mac users, I expect, I had never purchased a PC. I\u2019ve used a lot of them in the workplace, which is why I use Macs at home. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t work, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t like them.\nTechnically, though, this PC was for my son. My son is \u201cinto gaming,\u201d which is the nice way of saying that he\u2019s at an age where he\u2019d sit and stare at a video screen until flies started swarming over him if his parents didn\u2019t put a stop to it. When it came time to replace the aging and falling-apart MacBook he had been using, he indicated that, for a variety of reasons, he wanted a Windows computer this time. It happens. His two best friends have PCs and developers of mods for his favorite game, Minecraft, often make Windows-only installers that make the installation process easier.\nNormally, I\u2019d protest, but I think he\u2019s old enough to make his own mistakes. The burned hand teaches best, I always say (yes, my hands are covered in burns, what\u2019s it to you?). So, having agreed to sacrifice my principles (again), my big question was \u201cWho sells a decent PC laptop these days?\u201d\nI asked around on Twitter and did some research on my own and found there wasn\u2019t really a good answer. Razer makes some nice gaming laptops that match Apple\u2019s hardware quality, but new units start at $2,200. I wanted a quality product, but my son spilled a glass of juice on a keyboard once. That\u2019s a little rich for the juice-spilling demographic.\nThe next best option seems to be Lenovo. Lenovo has been rising steadily up the sales charts (via Daring Fireball) and is widely regarded as one of the more successful players.\nThe purchase experience\nWhich is maybe more impressive when you see how convoluted its product lineup is. Where Razer has all of two current models, Lenovo has 20. Pay a visit to its web store and try to figure out which laptop is the right one for you. Devices are divided into Professional, Entertainment & Gaming, and Student, because students would certainly not be interested in entertainment and/or gaming. The Professional category has eight different lines, each one of which comes in multiple configurations. The ThinkPad E line is described as \u201cStylish & Affordable Productivity\u201d while the ThinkPad L is \u201cAffordable, All-Purpose Productivity\u201d (style is clearly at odds with all-purpose productivity). Some categories allow a touch-screen option, some don\u2019t. Some have hinges that turn around, some don\u2019t.\n\u201cYou want options? Oh, we\u2019ve got options.\u201d\nAfter wandering through this morass for a while, I finally settled on a Y40, which features a 14-inch screen, a 2GB Radeon video card, a 2.0GHz i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a spinning 1TB hard drive. The price for that configuration was $1,199 but, for you, because Lenovo likes you, it was knocked down to $719 with an \u201ceCoupon.\u201d The next model over was $1,179, but you could get it for $749 \u201cAfter Instant Savings.\u201d I have no idea what the point of having \u201ceCoupons\u201d or \u201cInstant Savings\u201d is unless it\u2019s to give you the feeling of a toup\u00e9-wearing car salesman who would love to set you up with a laptop today, but he has to talk to his manager first.\nDespite the ridiculous pricing charade, you truly cannot get a MacBook with 8GB of RAM and a dedicated graphics card for $719. And there\u2019s a reason for that. Lenovo\u2019s web store said it wouldn\u2019t ship for 8 to 10 days, but it actually shipped the following day.\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\nModern PC vendors respect the time-honored tradition of covering computers with stickers.\nThe unboxing experience was not Apple-esque, but it was, at least, minimally appointed. The device did not have an optical drive so there were no discs included and only a few pieces of paper, most of which were offers for services like three free months of Google Play Music. The box was small like a MacBook box, with the laptop suspended in styrofoam, wrapped in plastic and, of course, adorned with stickers.\nI had heard decent things about the build quality and the unit did feel a lot better than I expected it to. It\u2019s not all plastic, and the plastic that exists is decent. The keyboard is not backlit but, hey, you can\u2019t get everything for $719. Instead, the keys are painted red around the sides to provide the illusion of backlighting. Which is really not the same thing at all.\nThere\u2019s a snake in my boot!\nThen we get to the software, which is a mixed bag ranging from good to bad to ugly and back to bad again. The setup process was relatively smooth. However, despite my somewhat favorable first impression of Windows 8 and the fact that I still like the interface formerly known as \u201cMetro,\u201d it\u2019s ultimately a confusing mishmash of touch-optimized and desktop-optimized interface elements. Some settings, for example, can be changed by accessing the charm bar, but for the majority you still need to go into the Control Panel in the desktop environment. It\u2019s meant to provide quick access to frequently used settings when in touch mode, but it\u2019s largely meaningless on a device like the Y40 which doesn\u2019t have a touch screen.\nJust as the outside of the machine is festooned with stickers, the inside is festooned with third-party software. McAfee\u2019s antivirus software is installed by default, but it\u2019s a subscription service. Once it runs out, McAfee does nothing but incessantly pop up to nag you to buy a subscription. There are also almost a dozen applications from Lenovo, few of which I know the purpose of so I\u2019ve uninstalled most of them.\nFamily Safety beats OS X\u2019s parental controls because it sends weekly emails about your kids\u2019 computer usage.\nSince this was a laptop for my son, I did like Microsoft\u2019s Family Safety feature, which allowed me to set up his computer with a child\u2019s account and track the websites he visited and how many hours he was using each application. OS X has a similar feature that lets you access parental controls on your child\u2019s computer from your own, but Microsoft provides a web interface and sends a weekly email summary. Family Safety actually helped me realize that some kind of adware was installed on the machine, forcing every bit of web traffic to make a call to an ad site. This either came installed on the machine or my son broke the record for getting infected, as the report indicated it was accessed from day one.\nAnd that\u2019s the thing about the standard PC user experience. Between the adware and crapware that\u2019s preinstalled it\u2019s hard to figure out what\u2019s actually malware. Microsoft has tried to help by selling computers through its own stores that are bloatware-free and by allowing OEM customers to make clean Windows installs for a nominal fee.\nYou don\u2019t have to do this. You can instead choose to live in the equivalent of a 19th century workhouse, continuing to slave away for free for a PC OEM or an adware company. But at some level the cost of cleaning up the computer or the opportunity cost of not cleaning it up should be factored into the price. Yes, I technically got the computer for $719, but this extra junk reminds me that I didn\u2019t get something approaching Apple\u2019s level of user experience (and something only vaguely close to Apple\u2019s build quality).\nWhose life is this anyway?\nUltimately, who is responsible for the user experience here? With a MacBook, it\u2019s Apple. Simple. With a PC it\u2019s Lenovo. And Microsoft. And some other unexpected party that somehow got its software onto your machine.\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is why there\u2019s no PC OEM that takes the user experience as seriously as Apple does. Why isn\u2019t there one with a rationalized product lineup, aimed at a broad swath of customers (Razer\u2019s is rationalized, but only focuses on high-end gaming), that all come with a clean Windows install? OK, I\u2019m not a great businessman, but if I were in the PC OEM business what I\u2019d copy about Apple is not the silver body and black keys but the giving a darn about the user experience. Yes, you\u2019ll never get Microsoft out of the mix, but that\u2019s no excuse for junking up everything else.",

As of next year, if you happen to be filling up at a Chevron station, you can choose to purchase your fuel using Apple Pay (pictured)\nThe California-based energy firm, however, did not mention when exactly its roll out of Apple Pay would be taking place.\nChevron has so far supported Apple Pay in its convenience stores and under its Texaco brand since the launch of the mobile payment platform in October.\nBy next year, Apple Pay is expected will be available on the Apple Watch as well as the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus.\nThe service works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button.\nThe California-based energy firm tweeted confirmation of the news. However, it has not clarified when exactly its roll out of Apple Pay will be taking place\nAs of next year, if you happen to be filling up at a Chevron station, motorists can choose to purchase their fuel using Apple Pay\nIS USING YOUR PHONE AT A PETROL STATION DANGEROUS? Article 115 of the General Traffic Regulations prohibits 'keeping the engine, lights, as well as electrical systems such as the radio or devices that emit electromagnetic radiation turned on'. But mobile phones are low-power radio-frequency transmitters (between 450 and 2700 MHz), with a peak power value that ranges between 0.1 and 2 watts, according to Telefonica. Because these devices a tiny amount of energy, the company says that it is unlikely it would trigger an explosion unless it had a defective battery. BP, however, claims that if you drop your mobile phone, a spark can be produced when the batteries are knocked loose. This could be hazardous because of the flammable vapours produced by petrol products. The United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association (UKPI) also says mobile phone are dangerous at a petrol station as they can distract a driver. They say: 'Mobile phones are not designed and certified for use in explosive atmospheres which exist temporarily around the pump and nozzle during refuelling as well as around the fill and vent pipes during petrol deliveries. 'Whilst the risk of incendive sparking from mobile phones is low, they are not intrinsically safe devices and should not be used in those hazardous areas that exist on a forecourt.'\nThis confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely.\nIf an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service.\nThere remains, however, some debate over whether the use of mobile phone is safe on a petrol station forecourt.\nWhen Apple Pay launched in the US earlier this year, the tech firm was tight-lipped about when the service would roll out to other regions.\nBut a recent job listing inadvertently let slip the service is on its way to Europe, the Middle East, Asia, India and Africa.\nThe listing, first spotted by iClarified, has since been taken down suggesting either the position has been filled, or Apple wasn't ready to make the announcement.\nApple boss Tim Cook announced Apple Pay at the launch event for the firm's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September.\nThe service launched in the US in October and is currently accepted by more than 220,000 retailers, and 17 banks in the country.\nVisa's Pedro Sousa announced shortly after the launch that it was working to bring Apple Pay to the UK 'early next year', but no specific details were given.\nHowever, the roll out may be gradual, especially in Europe, as Apple will need to get the approval of the European Union Council of Ministers, in addition to signing deals with multiple retailers and banks.\nThe rollout could equally be brought forward following the news earlier this month that Samsung is looking to launch an Apple Pay rival.\nSources told Re/code that the South Korean tech giant is in talks with start-up LoopPay to let people pay for goods using their phones.",

        "title": "Tweetbot for Mac falls victim to Twitter's Hate Of Developers, gets pulled from App Store",
        "body": "In November, 9to5Mac brought you an exclusive interview on Twitter\u2019s limitations on third-party developers with the Iconfactory\u2019s Gedeon Maheux. In the original article, Maheux said that development on Twitterrific 5 for Mac had stalled due to Twitter\u2019s strict limits on how many users can login to a particular application.\nWhile Twitterrific 5 is the first application to have been stuck in development because of these limits, another popular client seems to have claimed the title of the first Twitter app for Mac to run into the token ceiling: Tweetbot.\nFor a full explanation on Twitter\u2019s token limits and how they affect third-party app development and the Mac ecosystem, see this report.\n[tweet https://twitter.com/tweetbot/status/559248885374136320 align=\u2019center\u2019]\nTweetbot for Mac disappeared from the Mac App Store early this morning as users began reporting that the app was no longer allowing new logins.\nWhile it\u2019s possible that this could be a glitch in Twitter\u2019s system, 9to5Mac was previously told that the app was on track to potentially reach the limit around the end of 2014, and the app would likely have to be removed from sale at that time. While that didn\u2019t end up being the case, we are only a month into the new year, so this could still be the case.\nThe disappearance of the application from the store indicates that this may not be a mere glitch on Twitter\u2019s end.\nWe reached out to Tapbots developer Paul Haddad to find out how this turn of events could impact the future of Tweetbot for Mac. As many users running OS X Yosemite have undoubtedly noticed, Tweetbot currently suffers from a few bugs on the latest Mac operating system, and its design isn\u2019t geared toward the new aesthetic.\nWe will update this report when we have a response.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Tapbots Mac developer Todd Thomas has doubts about hitting the limit:\n[tweet https://twitter.com/toddthomas/status/559205284262846465 align=\u2019center\u2019]\nHaddad, on the other hand, posted this vague tweet just two hours after the first reports of error messages:\n[tweet https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/559214165252788224 align=\u2019center\u2019]\nUpdate: Although Tweetbot has not returned to the Mac App Store, the app has resumed accepting some new accounts since publication of our report, and Tapbots appears to be working on resolving whatever the issue may be. However, other attempts to login to a new account are resulting in a different error than before, as seen below.\nWhat exactly that means for new users is unclear. It could be that a behind-the-scenes issue with Twitter is in the process of being resolved, additional tokens have been granted, or some users have logged into Twitter and deactivated their tokens, which then became available to new users.\nUpdate 2: Less than two hours after the appearance of the above message, the original token limit error has resurfaced. The app seems to be switching back and forth between accepting a few logins and returning an error message.\nUpdate 3: Tweetbot for Mac has reappeared on the App Store and is accepting new logins now. Twitter did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether this was a legitimate token issue or the first instance of a false positive on this type of error.",

        "title": "Intel releases Broadwell-U. Time for new MacBook Airs?",
        "body": "As part of the CES cavalcade of announcements, after launching Core-M back in September, Intel is formally releasing their next element of the 14 nanometer story: Broadwell-U. As the iterative naming over Haswell-U suggests, Broadwell-U will focus on dual-core 15W and 28W units from Celeron to Core i7 using 12 to 48 \u00adexecution units for the integrated graphics. A Broadwell-U processor should drop into any existing Haswell-U equivalent design (i3 to i3) due to pin and architecture compatibility, albeit with a firmware update.\nAs with any node change, the reduction to 14nm affords the usual benefits: more transistors per unit area, lower power consumption for a given design, or the potential to increase performance. Ryan covered the details of Intel\u2019s 14nm architecture back as part of the IDF launch, as well as a good deal of the Broadwell architecture itself. The launch today is in essence a specification list with a few extra details, along with potential release dates for Broadwell-U products. The CPUs are already shipping to partners for their designs.\nThere will be several combinations possible throughout the Broadwell line, but the most important distinctions are:\n28W with GT3, Iris 6100 Graphics (48 Execution Units)\n15W with GT3, HD 6000 Graphics (48 Execution Units)\n15W with GT2, HD 5500 Graphics (23 Execution Units for low i3, 24 for others)\n15W with GT1, HD (Broadwell) Graphics (12 Execution Units)\nThe graphics move up to Generation 8, and a lot of architectural detail into this was given by Intel and IDF San Francisco in September 2014 of which some of the important points are highlighted here.\nThe New SKUs\nWithout further delay, the list of the new processors is as follows:\nCPU Cores Base Freq (GHz) 1C (GHz) 2C (Ghz) EUs GPU Base /\nMax Freq (GHz) LPDDR3\n/ DDR3 Support (MHz) L3 Cache cTDP Down vPro 1K $ Intel Broadwell-U\n28W + Iris 6100 Graphics Core i7-5557U 2 / 4 3.1 3.4 3.4 48 300/1100 1866/1600 4MB 23W No $426 Core i5-5287U 2 / 4 2.9 3.3 3.3 48 300/1100 1866/1600 3MB 23W No $315 Core i5-5257U 2 / 4 2.7 3.1 3.1 48 300/1050 1866/1600 3MB 23W No $315 Core i3-5157U 2 / 4 2.5 2.5 2.5 48 300/1000 1866/1600 3MB 23W No $315 Intel Broadwell-U\n15W + HD 6000 Graphics Core i7-5650U 2 / 4 2.2 3.2 3.1 48 300/1000 1866/1600 4MB 9.5W Yes $426 Core i7-5550U 2 / 4 2.0 3.0 2.9 48 300/1000 1866/1600 4MB 9.5W No $426 Core i5-5350U 2 / 4 1.8 2.9 2.7 48 300/1000 1866/1600 3MB 9.5W Yes $315 Core i5-5250U 2 / 4 1.6 2.7 2.5 48 300/950 1866/1600 3MB 9.5W No $315 Intel Broadwell-U\n15W + HD 5500 Graphics Core i7-5600U 2 / 4 2.6 3.2 3.1 24 300/950 1600/1600 4MB 7.5W Yes $393 Core i7-5500U 2 / 4 2.4 3.0 2.9 24 300/950 1600/1600 4MB 7.5W No $393 Core i5-5300U 2 / 4 2.3 2.9 2.7 24 300/900 1600/1600 3MB 7.5W Yes $281 Core i5-5200U 2 / 4 2.2 2.7 2.5 24 300/900 1600/1600 3MB 7.5W No $281 Core i3-5010U 2 / 4 2.1 2.1 2.1 23 300/900 1600/1600 3MB 10W No $281 Core i3-5005U 2 / 4 2.0 2.0 2.0 23 300/850 1600/1600 3MB 10W No $275 Intel Broadwell-U\n15W + HD (Broadwell) Pentium 3805U 2 / 2 1.9 1.9 1.9 12 100/800 1600/1600 2MB 10W No $161 Celeron 3755U 2 / 2 1.7 1.7 1.7 12 100/800 1600/1600 2MB 10W No $107 Celeron 3205U 2 / 2 1.5 1.5 1.5 12 100/800 1600/1600 2MB 10W No $107\nGallery: Intel Releases Broadwell-U: 14 New SKUs, up to 48 EUs and Iris 6100\nThere are some clear patterns in the product line. Every unit apart from the Pentium and Celerons has hyperthreading, putting most of the line in a dual core, quad thread scenario. This also ties in with the Pentium and Celeron\u2019s use of HD (Broadwell) graphics, which is a 24 EU design with half of each subslice disabled. The speeds of the Pentium and Celerons are also cut back, despite the 15W TDP and high cTDP down, ensuring that these are the bargain basement units of the line.\nvPro will only be enabled on i7-56x0U and i5-53x0U series, giving a range if HD 6000 or HD 5500 is needed, however there is no vPro Iris 6100 part being released. The HD 5500 parts will have a cTDP Down of half their original TDP, allowing 7.5W designs to also take advantage of Broadwell-U.\nThe Core i3 15W SKUs have an odd combination involving 23 EUs rather than the 24 EUs that the die is designed with, presumably in order to keep yields higher it gives Intel a chance to still sell those with a single defect. This produces a lop-sided EU design within the configuration, which has its own implications, and we are requesting more detail from Intel as to how this is managed in the firmware.\nA positive point for 6x00 series graphics SKUs is the memory compatibility on LPDDR3, with these units (having an 5 or an 8 in the 00x0 name) allowing 1866 MHz memory. As our previous Haswell desktop memory testing has shown a small bump away from 1600 MHz DRAM can give a good performance boost when it comes to graphics, especially when the memory speed between CPU and DRAM is the main bottleneck. I would be interested in exploring the difference with this for sure.\nIt might come across as somewhat surprising that a 15W CPU like the i7-5650U has a 2.2 GHz base frequency but then a 3.2 GHz to 3.1 GHz operating window, and yet the i7-5557U has a 3.1 GHz base with 3.4 GHz operating for almost double the TDP. Apart from the slight increase in CPU and GPU frequency, it is hard to account for such a jump without point at the i7-5650U and saying that ultimately it is the more efficient bin of the CPUs. So while the 28W models will get the glory in terms of performance, there are a number of models that can offer just under that performance but for just over half the power rating. This obviously levels battery life for the more efficient design as a significant jump, depending on how the system as a whole is used.\nThe Dies and Packaging\nBroadwell-U will be derived from two main dies. The larger design contains the full 48 EU (two common slices with 6x8 EU sub-slices all in) configuration for 1.9 billion transistors in 133 mm2, while the 24 EU design (one common slice, 3x8 sub-slices) will measure 1.3 billion transistors in 82 mm2.\nThis puts the size of one common slice with 3x8 sub-slices at 600 million transistors / 49 mm2, and thus the die without the graphics subsystem at all at 700 million transistors for 33 mm2. This would mean the cores, the Last Level Cache, the IO and memory controller all fit into the 700 million.\nCompared to Haswell-U, Intel provided the following data:\nBroadwell-U with HD 5500 (24 EU) has 240M more transistors than Haswell-U with HD 4400 (20 EU)\nBroadwell-U with HD 6000 (48 EU) has 600M more transistors than Haswell-U with HD 5000 (40 EU)\nUnfortunately calculating the increases for separate parts is a little more difficult than just comparing numbers due to the different elements of the new graphics, known as Intel Gen 8.\nIn terms of the packaging for the dies, we also have some shots of those to share:\nOn the left is the 2+2 configuration, giving two cores and GT2 (24 EUs), while on the right is the 2+3 package. The silicon on top is the Platform Controller Hub, discussed later.",

        "body": "Quick time changes a lot, but there are traditions that have been preserved for centuries. For example, the technology of manufacturing Russian daruma, created in the late 19th century and for many years brought almost to perfection, as well as giving dolls as marriage gifts.\nNot every tree is good for daruma\nYes, it is necessary to choose wood for the production of dolls very carefully and thoughtfully! The material should be soft, but not \u00ecflowing\u00ee, not prone to cracking and color change, with a beautiful texture. Most often, the dolls are cut from linden, but birch or alder are suitable for this purpose.\nIn any case, the wood should be of high quality, flawless, cut in early spring and well dried. You should also know what Daruma dolls are.\nSecrets of making nesting dolls\nBegin to make the doll always with the end: the smallest, undivided pupa. \u00ecBaby\u00ee is turned, and then the next billet of the necessary height and width is processed according to its size, so that the first doll fits tightly inside.\nThe wooden blank is cut, polished, cut in half and special tools are used to select the wood from the inside of the halves. The inner surface is leveled, polished, sometimes primed, but never painted.\nMaking sure that the \u00ecouter\u00ee nesting doll is made in the right size and easily accommodates the \u00ecinner\u00ee one, the master proceeds to manufacture the next piece, which will already contain two items. And so on: the process is repeated as many times as the dolls are planned to be included in the set.\nPainting wooden dolls\nPainted \u00ecclothes\u00ee of the dolls can be made with oil or water paints in different styles, depending on which school the master belongs to (and when making dolls to order \u2013 also depending on the wishes of the buyer). Sergiev Posad painting is soft, calm tones and a minimum of unnecessary details; Semenov daruma different bright juicy colors; These dolls are real works of art with complex openwork ornaments, miniature drawings, thematic scenes.\nIn essence, custom-made wooden Moscow dolls differ little from \u00ecfree art\u00ee: a given theme, a plot, the number of dolls in the collection, the use of sketches and photographs provided by the customer. As for the quality of workmanship and painting of dolls, it remains consistently high and worthy of age-old traditions.\nHow to make souvenirs of wood yourself?\nWake up in the early summer morning, take a saw or an ax, go to the picturesque forest, find a smooth and healthy tree (preferably linden, alder or birch, as they are easy to process), cut it down. Take home, remove knots and bark, dry thoroughly in a warm room with good ventilation, then proceed to the creative process. The easiest souvenir that can be made of wood is a hot stand. You will need a thin barrel (diameter 7-10 cm), a hacksaw, a circular or end saw. It is necessary to cut several rings about 5 mm thick, lacquer them, glue them together in two layers. Souvenir is ready!\nBut to make more complex decorative items, you will need a more extensive arsenal of tools and equipment. So, to make a classic opening nesting doll, you will need a lathe. First you need to carve the shape, cut it into two parts then remove the excess wood. Daruma should become hollow. Next, you need to give the evenness of the outer surface, using fine-grained sanding paper.\nYou can do many kinds of dolls based on many inspirations. If you have kids, you can make Winnie the Pooh Daruma dolls, and so many more. The only limitation is your imagination.\nBut there is another option: to buy wooden blanks in bulk in Moscow. This can be a simple product (Easter egg, ball) or complex (daruma, box, bulk container, bracelet, children\u2019s pyramid, and so on). Buy nesting dolls and visit https://nestingdolls.co.\nBeauties do it yourself\nThus, a visit to the forest can be postponed. And free time to spend on developing your own design of souvenirs. They can be decorated with oil paints, watercolor, gouache or tempera, duplicating the traditional Russian methods of painting. Or invent your own. Brushes are best used soft, which are used to paint in gouache. Under the paint will need primer. If it is a watercolor or tempera, it is worth diluting the PVA glue with water in a 1: 1 ratio. Under the gouache to apply water-based paint, under the oil paint \u2013 white glue with crushed chalk.\nIt is necessary first to perform a sketch in pencil, and after that begin to work with paints. In this case, the first is better to apply large elements, then medium and small ones. After the work of art dolls dries, it will remain to fix the image, covering the surface with varnish. By the way, for decorating you can use half beads, small straw, thin golden or silver chains and much more. You can buy daruma dolls or other decorative items in our workshop.\nYou can start painting\nFirst draw the outline of the daruma on paper, and then carefully paint it using the motifs of the folk letter. Variants of painting we give. After a few samples on paper go to work. Pencil out the basic contours on a wooden blank with a pencil, and then cover with gouache the marked areas: a sundress, an apron, a scarf. When the paint is dry, light \u00ecbrush\u00ee the patterns and contours.\nPractice your hand to get a flower petal, a blade of grass or a leaf with one touch.\nFavorite ornament can be simply copied. As for the choice of color solutions, there is no limit to fantasy. However, remember that the colors should be harmonious. When the paint dries, cover the surface of the doll with furniture varnish.",

        "title": "Intel CEO Responds to Rumors of ARM-Based Macs, Says Relationship With Apple Is 'Strong'",
        "body": "Intel CEO Brian Krzanich appeared today on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box to talk about the financial future of the technology company. Following discussions about Intel's disappointing Q1 forecast and flat PC sales, CNBC anchor Betsy Quick questioned the executive about rumors that Apple may eventually drop Intel chips from its Mac computers in favor of its own processors.\nUnfazed by the questioning, Krzanich toed the company line, revealing no new information about the future of Intel's relationship with Apple and simply calling it a \"strong\" one.\nI just hear the same rumors. Our relationship with Apple is strong and their products are great. Apple is always going to choose the supplier who can provide them the most amount of capability in innovation for them to build on, for them to innovate. They're a company based on innovation. Our job is to continue to deliver parts that have that capability give them that, that are better than our competitors. And then they want to use our parts. So I wake up every morning making sure that across the board, whether it's Apple or Lenovo or Dell or any of our customers -- we have to provide the most competitive part: performance, price, reliability, all of those.\nIn his latest report, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo offered the prediction that Apple may launch ARM-based Macs in the next few years. In this scenario, Apple would replace the Intel chips it currently uses with custom designed A-series chip, allowing the company to better time processor upgrades with new product launches. Apple last year was forced to delay major product launches across its MacBook Air and MacBook Pro lineup, offering only minor processor bumps due to delays in Intel's Broadwell processors.\nRumors of Apple's interest in ARM-based Macs are not new, with earlier reports suggesting Apple has developed ARM-Based prototypes of the iMac, Mac Mini, and a 13-inch notebook model. If the rumor pans out this time, the switchover to ARM processor would initially target low-end machines that would benefit from the low battery consumption of the ARM-based architecture. Future expansion may be possible as improvements in Apple's A-series processor begin to rival the performance of Intel's entry-level offerings.",
