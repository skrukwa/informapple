You'll find it is designed to fit seamlessly into the outdated headphone connector, transforming last year's phone into a modern masterpiece as beautifully as you'd expect from Apple. Once in place, Apple Plug cannot be removed. But why would you want to? Would you want to downgrade? We didn't think so.",

        "title": "Video claiming drilling into iPhone 7 will reveal hidden headphone port goes viral. Prank video destroying new Apple smartphone receives 10m views, with some seemingly tricked into making 3.5mm hole in the bottom of their devices. (Duh: Don\u2019t do this!)",
        "body": "A video claiming that users can add a headphone socket to the iPhone 7, which only has a Lightning port, by drilling into the bottom of their phone has been watched almost 10m times.\nThe prank video shows a man drilling a 3.5mm hole into the bottom left edge of the iPhone 7 held in a vice. It points to the row of small holes on the left side that replaced the headphone socket present on the iPhone 6S and claims that drilling into the second hole on the left reveals a hidden socket.\nOnce the hole has been drilled the video shows an iPhone 7 playing music, although the sound comes out of the speakers, not the white headphones now inserted in the DIY hole.\n\u2018This video is for those who don\u2019t want to get $159 wireless AirPods or have to insert your headphones into an adapter every time you listen to music\u2019 says the caption of the video.\nThe video was produced by Sacramento, California-based Ukrainian YouTuber Taras Maksimuk who \u201cspecialises in smashing technology for your pleasure\u201d according to his profile. Some of Maksimuk\u2019s other videos include \u201cwhat happens if you microwave an iPhone 7\u201d and \u201ccan the iPhone 7 survive in liquid nitrogen for five minutes\u201d.\nIn total Maksimuk has seven separate videos showing him destroying iPhone 7s, but that seemingly hasn\u2019t stopped people drilling holes into the bottom of their new iPhones and causing irreparable damage.\nThe YouTube video\u2019s comment section \u2013 normally a place filled with vitriol and despair for humanity \u2013 was full of people claiming to have performed the operation and destroying their iPhone 7 in the process, the sincerity of which is questionable.\nSome Dude said: \u201cWTF??? Fuck you! My screen turned black the moment I started drilling and now I can\u2019t even open it.\u201d\n\u201cTECHRAX YOU PIECE OF SHIT I DID THIS AND THE SOUND DOESN NOT WORK AT ALL,\u201d said Artur.\nLukelaluke123 said: \u201cARE YOU KIDDING ME? I WAITD TILL MY DAD WAS SLEEP THEN I WENT TO THE GARAGE AND GOT HIS DIRLL AND DID THIS ND NOW MY IPHONE WONT NOT EVEN WORK!!!!! YOU ARE SUCH ASCUM BAG WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS IM GOING TO MAEK SURE YOURE UTUBE CHANNEL IS GETS SHUT DOWN.\u201d\nThe video received over 134,000 likes, but just under 88,000 dislikes. It\u2019s unclear how many of the dislikes were from people who had been tricked into drilling a hole into their \u00a3600-plus smartphone.\nNot only will drilling a hole into the bottom of the iPhone 7 not reveal a hidden headphone socket, but it will also ruin the waterproofing of the smartphone, which requires the membranes covering the holes in the bottom of the phone to be undamaged.\nMaksimuk\u2019s video is the latest in a long run of pranks targeting gullible iPhone buyers. Pranksters managed to convince some users that the iOS 7 update magically made their iPhones waterproof in 2013, while some iPhone 6 users were tricked into microwaving their smartphones while seeking longer battery life. Both pranks only led to destroyed smartphones.",

        "title": "Apple surveying MacBook pro users about the headphone jack and other ports",
        "body": "In recent weeks, Apple has been sending out surveys to users asking about MacBook Pro features, most notably the headphone jack. A survey question shared by MacRumors reader Blake asks \"Do you ever use the headphone port on your MacBook Pro with Retina display?\"\nThere are several other reports on Twitter from users who have been asked similar questions about the headphone jack, suggesting Apple is exploring the removal of the headphone jack in a future version of the MacBook Pro. Apple has eliminated the headphone jack from the iPhone, so it makes sense that the trend will continue for other products.\nApple is also asking users about battery life and other ports, including the SD card slot. One question asked \"How do you upload photos from a digital camera or phone to your MacBook Pro with Retina Display?\"\nBased on a leaked MacBook Pro shell, the upcoming MacBook Pro will include four USB-C ports and a headphone jack, with Apple doing away with all other ports on the machine. If the shell is an actual part, the machine will not include an SD card slot, HDMI port, USB-A port, or a MagSafe connection.\nThe design of the MacBook Pro that's launching in 2016 has already been finalized ahead of its release, and Apple is likely to continue using the same design for several years going forward, so the removal of the headphone jack is probably not something that MacBook Pro users need to worry about for the foreseeable future.\nRumors suggest Apple will release a redesigned MacBook Pro with a redesigned chassis and an OLED touch panel as early as October.",

        "title": "Apple Hikes Order Volumes for iPhone 7 Parts in Wake of Samsung Recall",
        "body": "Apple has reportedly hiked orders for parts and components required for the production of the upcoming iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, according to sources from the supply chain in Taiwan (via DigiTimes).\nApple shipped on average 30 million iPhone 6s units a month in the second half of 2015. The company originally predicted shipments of the iPhone 7 this year would reach only 60 percent of that number over the same period, but supply chain sources are today reporting that Apple has boosted its original prediction by 10 percent.\nDummy mockups of iPhone 7 handsets\nThe hike in order volumes suggests Apple is increasingly upbeat about demand for the new devices among existing iPhone owners seeking to upgrade, despite relatively subdued interest in the iPhone 7 models compared to the pre-launch buzz of previous years.\nAnother potential factor in Apple's upward revision is Samsung's global recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone last week, which followed numerous complaints that the device caught fire while charging. The news arguably couldn't have come at a worse time for Apple's biggest rival, which has pitched its Note 7 as a direct competitor to Apple's 5.5-inch iPhones.\nSamsung has already voluntarily pulled its flagship device from 10 countries, including South Korea and the U.S. Target has reportedly stopped selling the phone, while Amazon and Best Buy have also said they are no longer selling the Note 7. In the latest blow, Consumer Reports has called for an official recall which would make it illegal to sell the phones in the U.S.\nSamsung has told customers it will take at least 14 days to replace their phones, and with several mobile operators including T-Mobile offering full refunds to Note buyers over the same week the new iPhones are expected to be announced, Apple's offering could prove a tempting alternative.\nA lot depends on how fast Apple can fulfill pre-orders for its new handsets. While the company typically releases an iPhone about two weeks after introducing it, scheduling information from AT&T indicates that the iPhone 7 might not launch until later in the month, on September 23.\nPrevious information from notable smartphone leaker Even Blass suggested pre-orders for the iPhone 7 will take place this Friday, September 9, two days after the debut event. That date is in line with the schedule from AT&T.\nHowever, Blass also predicted an iPhone launch for September 16, so if the AT&T information is accurate and does relate to release preparations, the previous prediction could be incorrect. September 16 and September 23 are both likely candidates for an iPhone release date.\nDespite Apple's revised orders, some suppliers reportedly remain worried that the uplift could be short-lived, given that order volumes for new parts and components may start drifting down in Q4 \"on seasonality\".\nBe sure to check out our \"What to Expect\" post for a recap on other announcements expected at Wednesday's event and stay tuned to MacRumors for other last-minute news and rumors.\nWe'll have full live coverage here on MacRumors.com on the event day, as well as through our MacRumorsLive Twitter account, starting at 10:00 AM Pacific Time.",

        "title": "Tim Cook Says Apple is 'Very Committed' to the Mac and to 'Stay Tuned'",
        "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook has responded to a MacRumors reader's email about the lack of a long-awaited MacBook Pro refresh, stressing that he \"loves the Mac\" and that Apple is \"very committed\" to it. He told the customer, who wishes to remain anonymous, to \"stay tuned,\" suggesting that updates to the Mac lineup are on the horizon.\nMacRumors cannot fully confirm the authenticity of the email, but it does appear to originate from Apple's corporate servers based on full headers we saw. Apple executives occasionally respond to customer emails, but it is possible the response was handled by Apple's executive relations or public relations teams.\nAn update to the Mac lineup at some point is inevitable, and the bigger focus is now on when that will happen. The latest word is that Apple will release new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models with USB-C ports as early as October, while updated iMac models with an option for new AMD graphics chips are also in the works.\nThat report reiterated rumors that the new MacBook Pro will be thinner and include an OLED-based touch bar along the top of the flatter keyboard, which will present functions that dynamically fit the current task or application, as well as integrate Touch ID to enable users to quickly log in using their fingerprint.\nOur own Mac Buyer's Guide shows that it has been 479 days since the MacBook Pro was last updated, while the MacBook Air has not been refreshed in 550 days. Similarly, the Mac mini has not been refreshed in 694 days, while the Mac Pro is five days shy of 1000 days since its last update. iMacs stand at 332 days.",

        "title": "KGI: iPhone 7 to feature 2.4GHz A10 chip, IPX7 waterproofing, new 12 megapixel cameras, piano black color, more",
        "body": "A weekend report from KGI is shining some last minute details on the iPhone 7. As well as reaffirming everything we\u2019ve already heard, such as the design resembling the iPhone 6s with tweaked antenna lines, the report includes some specific details about certain changes.\nKGI says that the iPhone 7 will include the new Apple A10 SoC, which will be CPU clocked at up to 2.4GHz, a dramatic increase over the existing A9 silicon. The iPhone 7 will also come in two new color options which KGI describes as \u201cdark black\u201d and glossy \u201cpiano black\u201d, replacing space grey. There are also changes to the speaker system, Force Touch sensors, waterproofing and more. Many details after the jump, including an explanation of what the iPhone 7 Plus dual-camera system comprises \u2026\nKGI\u2019s Ming-Chi Kuo says that the iPhone 7 will be offered in two new case colors which are called \u201cdark black\u201d and \u201cpiano black\u201d. Space Grey \u2014 as it is exists today \u2014 will be removed from the lineup meaning iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be offered in a total of five colors. The piano black is described as glossy and corroborates leaked SIM trays seen previously (pictured above). Due to low yield, piano black may only be offered exclusively on high-capacity iPhone 7 models, at least at first.\nIn terms of the internal performance, the report claims the iPhone 7 will be powered by a new Apple A10 chip manufactured by TSMC using a new \u2018InFO\u2019 process. Apparently, this chip will be a major upgrade over the Apple A9 chip seen in the iPhone 6s with maximum clock speed hitting 2.4 GHz.\nThe iPhone 7 screen display will also be getting an upgrade. Although size and resolution are staying the same, at 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, the displays will \u2018copy\u2019 the visual features of the 9.7 inch iPad Pro. This means the iPhone 7 display will be able to render wide-color imagery. This will help boost the appearance of the photos taken by the new cameras in the iPhone 7.\nThe 4.7 inch iPhone 7 camera will be getting an upgrade but this KGI report focuses on the brand-new dual camera system which will be exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus. The report says the dual camera will enable optical zoom and \u2018light field camera applications\u2019. The dual camera is made up of a wide-angle camera and a telephoto camera. Both cameras will feature 12 megapixel sensors. The larger camera will also feature optical image stabilisation and a 6P lens. This is markedly different technology to what Huawei uses in its dual-camera adorned P9 phone \u2014 it\u2019ll be interesting to see what Apple demos on Wednesday in regards to image quality.\nApple is also including a new camera flash component in the iPhone 7 to improve photos taken in low-light situations. Apple will be boosting the number of LEDs from two to four (two cool, two warm) to create a more effective True Tone flash in the upcoming handsets.\nMemory and RAM will also be increased. KGI says Apple will drop the 16 GB and 64 GB offering and add 256 GB storage tier. The new lineup will feature 32 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB models. The company will also bundle an additional 1 GB of RAM for the iPhone 7 Plus which is necessary to handle with the advanced camera processing provided by the dual-camera (an iPhone 7 Plus exclusive feature). Therefore, the 5.5.inch iPhone 7 Plus will include 3 GB RAM whereas the 4.7 inch iPhone 7 will feature 2 GB RAM \u2013 the same as the iPhone 6s.\nAgreeing with a leaked spec sheet from a few days ago, KGI says that Apple will include Lightning EarPods and a Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack adapter with every iPhone 7. This is to compensate for the lack of 3.5mm headphone jack in the hardware itself. KGI says that that space will be used to enhance the Force Touch recognition system. On the outside, it will look like a second speaker grille but it will actually house a new sensor to improve the \u2018Force Touch user experience\u2019. Apple is adding a new internal amplifier to boost sound output from the phone\u2019s receiver.\nKGI also claims the proximity sensor component is also getting a upgrade (\u2018switching from LCD to laser\u2019) with faster response times and longer recognition distance, with support for hand-waving gesture features. The inclusion of such gestures is not confirmed, however. The new iPhones will also be waterproof with an IPX7 rating, this is the same as the Apple Watch. This rating means the hardware will be able to withstand immersion in water up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes. According to KGI, Apple\u2019s high standards for waterproofing have impacted the supply chain and lowered total production of iPhone 7.\nIt is forecasting 65 million iPhone 7 units shipped by the end of the year, a significant decrease below the 82 million level set by the iPhone 6s in the same timeframe last year. KGI blames poor assembly yield and \u201climited innovative selling points\u201d. Although there are lot of changes to be seen, the analyst expects customer to focus on the new black color options, the dual camera, water resistance and the removal of the headphone jack.\nStay tuned to 9to5Mac for full coverage of the iPhone 7 event, scheduled for Wednesday 7 September. We\u2019ll have comprehensive reporting on everything Apple announces: new iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2, maybe more?",

        "body": "The iPhone 7's new A10 Fusion processor has gotten lost in most of the hype around the missing iPhone jack, but it shouldn't. In fact, based on our performance tests thus far, the iPhone 7 beats every major recent Android flagship phone. By a wide margin.\nTake the relatively new Geekbench 4 test, which has been updated to model real-world tasks and applications. On the mutli-core portion of the CPU performance test, the iPhone 7 scored 5,507. That obliterates the 3,918 score from the Galaxy S7. In other words, the iPhone 7 is 33 percent faster.\nPhoto: Jeremy Lips / Tom's Guide\nWe saw similar results from other premium Android phones, such as the LG G5, which notched 3,737 on the same Geekbench 4 test. However, the OnePlus 3, which benefits from 6GB of RAM, hit a fairly high 4,171.\nMORE: Best Lightning Headphones and Earbuds For Your iPhone 7\nSo what about graphics performance? The iPhone 7 turned in a very high score of 37,810 on the 3D Mark Ice Storm Unlimited Test. That beats the LG G5 (27,118), Galaxy S7 Edge (27,851), as well as the OnePlus 3 (29,957).\nWe also measured browser performance on the iPhone 7 and Android competition using the JetStream Javascript benchmark. And once again Apple's phone came out on top. It scored 169.04, compared with 44 for the Galaxy S7 and the low 50s for the LG G5 and OnePlus 3.\nTo gauge real-world performance, we also ran a quick app open time test using the Chameleon Run game. The iPhone 7 took 3.3 seconds, compared to 4.5 seconds or longer on the Galaxy S7 and LG G5.\nWe're still in the process of running other tests, so stay tuned for our full review.",

Others could say Schiller's comments are representative of the trademark Apple arrogance, indicative of a company culture in which doing what's logical and consumer-friendly is often conflated with doing what Apple executives think is best for its own product lines and for the industry, standards be damned.\nOf course, Apple has often been correct in its decisions to leave beyond tired technology (see optical disc drive and flash support). The company may prove right again in its bid to popularize wireless headphones and push the industry toward a more up-to-date connector. We won't know for quite some time.",

One day after release, iOS 10 was installed on 14.5 percent of devices, and at just under one week, following the release of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, it was installed on 34 percent of devices.\niOS 10 saw some early installation issues that may have made people wary of downloading the update, but its steady growth can be attributed to the many appealing features it offers, including a revamped Messages app with stickers and a full App Store, a Siri API for developers, a redesigned Lock Screen experience, a new Music app, new facial and object recognition capabilities in Photos, and more.\nLast year, less than two weeks after iOS 9 was released, Apple said it was installed on more than 50 percent of active devices, making it the operating system with the fastest ever adoption rates. Based on Mixpanel's numbers, it doesn't appear iOS 10 has outpaced it, but it did come close.",

The Apple Watch 2 will include GPS, a new faster chip and other changes.\nThose expecting Mac updates today are likely going to be disappointed as reports indicate they are not ready to be unveiled, although radical changes to the MacBook Pro are in the works.\nAlthough the store going down is fun to observe, it doesn\u2019t mean the products will be available to buy today by any means.

        "title": "The Verge - iPhone 7 review - 9/10",
        "body": "The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are deeply unusual devices. They are full of aggressive breaks from convention while wrapped in cases that look almost exactly like their two direct predecessors. Even that continuity of design is a break from convention; after almost a decade of Apple\u2019s steady two-year iPhone update pattern, merely retaining the same design for a third straight year plays against expectations.\nInside that case, everything else about the iPhone 7 is a decisive statement about the future. The dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus promise to usher in a new era in mobile photography. The iconic iPhone home button is no longer a physical button, but instead a sophisticated ballet of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that simulate the feel of a button. The new A10 Fusion processor blends two high-power cores that rival laptop performance with two low-power cores that combine with a much larger battery to extend run time by up to two hours.\nAnd, yes, Apple has removed the headphone jack.\nEverything else about the iPhone 7 is a decisive statement about the future\nRemoving the headphone jack is an act of pure confidence from Apple, which is the only company in tech that can set off a sea changes in the industry by aggressively dropping various technologies from its products. Floppy drives, optical drives, its own proprietary 30-pin iPod connector, flash, even USB \u2014 Apple decides that it\u2019s time to move on, and it has a massive installed base of customers that love and trust the company who make it happen. And now it\u2019s decided that \u2014 yikes \u2014 the headphone jack is over.\nAfter using the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for about a week, it\u2019s clear to me that Apple has forceful, but considered opinions about how the next generation of phones should fit into our lives. But it\u2019s also clear that the iPhone 7 is a transitional step to that vision of the future, not a complete expression of it. The question for would-be upgraders is simple: is all of the latent promise in this phone worth the inconvenience of that transition?\nDesign\nThere\u2019s really no getting around it: the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus look more or less exactly like the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus from 2014. They are now water resistant, which is nice, although they\u2019re not fully waterproof \u2014 keep them submerged in a meter of water for more than 30 minutes and things might not go your way. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7 and Note 7 are technically even more water resistant, but I think it\u2019s basically a push \u2014 you can get these phones casually wet now without catastrophe, and that\u2019s a big win. If you want to go snorkeling with your iPhone, you should probably get a case anyhow.\nOnce you put the iPhone 7 in a case, it looks exactly like an iPhone 6\nApart from the water resistance, there are three main external differences between the 6 and 7: first, the antenna lines on the back have been tweaked and colored to blend into the body on the matte black and glossy jet black models, which is a welcome refinement. (The antennas remain a dull gray color on the silver, gold, and rose gold variants; Apple says there are limits on what colors can be applied.) Second, the camera bump has been enlarged and more artfully curved into the rear casing, which looks particularly handsome on the smaller phone with a single camera.\nAnd third \u2014 here it is again \u2014 there\u2019s no headphone jack.\nBut really, once you put the iPhone 7 in a case, it looks exactly like an iPhone 6. And if you get a jet black model, you\u2019ll want to get it into a case immediately \u2014 my jet black review unit scratched and scuffed almost instantly, and the only time it\u2019s remained fingerprint-free is when we literally handled it with white gloves for the photo and video shoots accompanying this review. Apple is being unusually open about the propensity of the jet black finish to scratch, but beyond that, I\u2019d get the matte black anyway \u2014 it just looks meaner.\nThe iPhone 6 has always been one of the more utilitarian designs in Apple history, and a smoothed-out camera bump and less visible antennas don\u2019t really change that. Apple\u2019s competition is getting better at making beautiful phones, and nothing about the iPhone 7\u2019s design exceeds the rest of the industry. The iPhone 7 Plus in particular is actually falling behind its large-screened competition; the 6 Plus was always a bit of a surfboard, and new devices like the Galaxy Note 7 fit enormous displays into much smaller, tighter packages. (Too bad about the explosions, though.) This is still a phone that looks best in a case.\nHome button, display, and speakers\nThe iPhone 7\u2019s new home button will elicit instant reaction from people; it\u2019s much more different than you might think. The button no longer moves at all \u2014 it\u2019s totally solid, just like newer MacBook trackpads. A linear vibration unit that Apple calls the Taptic Engine jolts when you apply pressure to the button, tricking your brain into feeling a click. It\u2019s nothing like the clumsy haptic feedback on other phones, which I\u2019ve always disliked \u2014 it really does feel like a click.\nThis system works tremendously well on MacBooks, but on the iPhone 7 it feels like the entire bottom of the phone is clicking, not like you\u2019re pushing a button. You can set the haptic feedback to one of three force settings that make it feel like a harder or stronger click, but it\u2019s definitely still strange, especially if the phone is lying down on a table instead of in your hand and you can see that you\u2019re just pushing against nothing.\nIt feels like the entire bottom of the phone is clicking\nI\u2019m sort of okay with all this, but other people who\u2019ve tried my review units really don\u2019t like it. There\u2019s something about a really great button, and the iPhone home button was an all-time great button. Apple says it switched up the home button to make it more customizable and more durable \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of people with the software button floating around their iPhone screens \u2014 but it\u2019ll take some adjustment to really get used to. You\u2019ll have to try it to decide for yourself.\nThe Taptic Engine also adds all sorts of other fun feedback to iOS 10 \u2014 when you drop the notification shade down, the phone does a little bump, for example. It makes it feel like the software on the screen has real weight and inertia, and I love it. Third-party apps can use the Taptic Engine as well, and I\u2019m really hoping the industry adds support faster than the slow, somewhat muted rollout of not-very-useful 3D Touch support. Taptic Engine feedback is the first really valuable new UI concept I\u2019ve seen on phones in years, while 3D Touch always seemed like more of a gimmick. It\u2019s strange that the iPhone 6S won\u2019t get these features even though it has a Taptic Engine; Apple says the unit in the iPhone 7 has been revised and made more precise, but it\u2019s still an odd omission.\n3D Touch is still present on the iPhone 7\u2019s display, and the display itself is improved. It\u2019s not as insane as the 2K and 4K OLED panels that have been popping up on Android phones, but it\u2019s a sharp, bright, and beautiful LCD, and sharp, bright, beautiful LCDs are very nice to look at. My review unit is also noticeably warmer than the iPhone 6S display, which I\u2019ve come to appreciate.\nThe display can show a wider range of colors now\nYou won\u2019t notice it in most apps, but the display can show a wider range of colors now, which is really obvious when you look at photos taken by the iPhone 7\u2019s camera \u2014 which now also captures a wider range of colors. Photos taken by the iPhone 7 look ridiculously good on the iPhone 7 display; you can tell the difference between a 7 photo and a 6S photo on the 7\u2019s screen almost instantly. That\u2019s the only place you\u2019ll really see the benefit of the new screen for now, but it\u2019s another place where app developers can really take advantage of powerful new hardware. Instagram has already announced an update to support wide color; let\u2019s hope others follow suit.\nApart from the revised camera, the new home button, the screen, and \u2014 heyo! \u2014 the headphone jack, the other notable external hardware change to the iPhone 7 is the addition of stereo speakers. One speaker is at the bottom of the phone, as it has been, and the other is actually integrated into the earpiece. They\u2019re much louder than before, and sound decent, with better treble performance in particular. They\u2019re never going to replace real speakers, but you can watch a bunch of YouTube videos or Snapchats and not get annoyed, and conference calls are dramatically improved.\nOkay, I\u2019ve made you wait long enough. Let\u2019s talk about that headphone jack, shall we?\nLightning Strikes\nSo there\u2019s no headphone jack on the iPhone 7. Apple says it needed to take out the headphone jack so it could make space for better cameras, the Taptic Engine (even though the 6S also had a Taptic Engine), and perhaps most importantly, a bigger battery. It was also easier to make a phone with one less hole in it water resistant, but Apple tells me that it wasn\u2019t a huge factor.\nApple ships a pair of its EarPods headphones with a Lightning connector in the box, as well as a Lightning-to-3.5mm dongle so you can use your traditional headphones. You\u2019re not totally out of luck if you have a big investment in corded headphones, but you\u2019re going to want to stock up on those adapters if you regularly plug your phone into a car or have a variety of headphones you like to use \u2014 the dongle is small enough that it\u2019s not obtrusive, but also small enough so that it\u2019s destined to get lost if you move it around a lot. At $9, the headphone dongle is the cheapest Apple hardware you can buy; the company thinks people will just buy a few and keep them permanently attached to older headphones. And I\u2019m sure third parties will come up with a million other options, although it\u2019ll be hard to beat $9.\nThe Lightning EarPods are exactly like Apple\u2019s regular EarPods, which is to say that they sound average-to-bad and fit either fine or not-great depending on your ears. Competitors like LG and HTC ship much higher quality headphones with their flagship phones, and Apple owns Beats, so it\u2019s just really hard to understand why it\u2019s still shipping such decidedly mediocre headphones with the iPhone. Especially when the company is trying to get everyone to be enthusiastic about the move away from 3.5mm. But here we are.\nOf course, the real move Apple\u2019s trying to make is to wireless audio, and the company also gave me a preproduction set of its AirPods wireless earbuds to try out. I can\u2019t fully review them here since they\u2019re not final, but they worked well \u2014 they\u2019re basically Bluetooth headphones that pair easier and faster with Apple\u2019s products because of a proprietary controller chip called the W1 and special software built into iOS, macOS, and watchOS. Once you pair the AirPods with one Apple device, they can seamlessly switch to all the others, which is very cool. But AirPods sound just like EarPods because they\u2019re basically EarPods without wires, so what you\u2019re getting for your $159 is convenience and early adopter status, not necessarily sound quality.\nI asked Apple if Dr. Dre or Jimmy Iovine consulted on the sound or design of the AirPods and there was a lot of demurring. I don\u2019t know why Beats is putting out new wireless headphones that have the W1 chip in them and Apple is putting out AirPods that sound just like EarPods when there\u2019s such obvious corporate collaboration opportunity there, but two of the three new Beats models charge via Micro USB and one charges via Lightning, so searching for order in this universe remains an entirely futile exercise.\nMore importantly, it\u2019s disappointing that Apple didn\u2019t put more work into making wireless audio a better overall experience on the iPhone 7. The company\u2019s own new W1 headphones get the fancy new pairing support, but other Bluetooth headphones and speakers still use the same somewhat flaky Bluetooth setup interface as before. And AirPlay feels all but abandoned; it was already getting less and less competitive over time, and the iPhone 7 and iOS 10 don\u2019t seem to offer any noticeable improvements.\nI\u2019ve been spending some serious time really thinking about when and where I use the headphone jack, and it turns out that I already do much of my music listening wirelessly: Bluetooth in the car, an Amazon Echo, a few Sonos speakers, a couple Bluetooth speakers here and there. This is about as messy and unintuitive as it gets, but it\u2019s not too far off the mainstream. I could buy a nice set of Bluetooth headphones that also support corded audio for watching movies on planes and basically be covered, but I won\u2019t get any of Apple\u2019s improvements to the wireless experience unless I buy a Beats Solo3 with the W1 in it.\nIt\u2019s disappointing that Apple didn\u2019t put more work into making wireless audio a better overall experience\nThat is the definition of ecosystem lock-in, and it\u2019s incredibly frustrating.\nApple took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple is serious about wireless audio, it\u2019s going to have to allow other companies to use the newer, better Bluetooth support in iOS that enhances its own W1 products, and it\u2019s going to have to make managing Bluetooth devices a lot nicer than it currently is.\nAnd if Apple is really serious about wireless audio, it will allow third parties to extend the AirPlay interface just like it allows third parties to extend Siri and iMessage; an iPhone without a headphone jack needs to have dead-simple integrations with all kinds of wireless speaker systems, whether they\u2019re from Sonos or Samsung or Amazon. To make wireless audio happen, Apple has to do the work of opening up and making the experience of connecting to any audio system on the iPhone as simple and frustration-free as pushing a button \u2014 as simple as wired audio has always been. Apple says it hasn\u2019t yet had any serious conversations about opening or extending its wireless audio interfaces, but that it\u2019s committed to a wireless world, so let\u2019s hope the company moves quickly.\nIt would also be nice if Apple would put out an adapter that lets you simultaneously charge your phone and listen to music that isn\u2019t the size of a VGA dongle, because I have no intention of letting this ridiculous Belkin thing anywhere near my bag. There\u2019s a huge opportunity for third-party accessory makers to fill all the gaps left by the removal of the headphone jack, but it\u2019s also clear that the first wave of accessories is going to be a little clumsy while everyone learns exactly what those gaps are and how best to fill them. (And if Mophie isn\u2019t working on a battery case with a headphone jack, customers should start picketing the company.)\nIf you squint, it\u2019s possible to see a future iPhone that has no wires at all \u2014 an iPhone that does everything wirelessly, including charging. But the iPhone 7 is not that iPhone. In fact, right now you need more wires, dongles, and adapters to make it work with the rest of your life than ever before. I love that stuff \u2014 it\u2019s part of the thrill of being an early adopter. But if you don\u2019t want to devote even a moment\u2019s effort toward figuring out how to do something as simple as charge your phone and listen to audio at the same time, it might be worth waiting for things to settle into place.\nCameras\nOne of my favorite recurring bits at iPhone introductions is when Phil Schiller notes, correctly, that the iPhone camera is likely the best camera most people will ever own. He\u2019s been saying it fairly regularly since the iPhone 4S came out in 2011, and he said it again last week when he introduced the iPhone 7 camera. This is an incredible fact, as is the fact that a huge number of people now quietly upgrade to a better camera on a fairly regular basis, and then use the hell out of that camera. The explosion in mobile photography is one of the most revolutionary aspects of the entire smartphone revolution, and the general excellence of the iPhone camera over time is a big reason why.\nThe iPhone 7 represents another upgrade over the iPhone 6S: there\u2019s a new, faster f/1.8 lens, the addition of optical image stabilization, a new four-color True Tone flash, and wider color capture. This all adds up to a decent improvement, but the iPhone 6S was already operating at the top of the scale, bested only recently by the latest cameras in the Galaxy S7 and Note 7. In low light, that faster lens and optical image stabilization means that the 7 significantly outperforms the 6S. But compared to the iPhone 6S, the iPhone 7 is a step improvement, not a major leap.\nClick on individual images to see full width\nThe attempt at a major leap is on the iPhone 7 Plus. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. These cameras operate simultaneously; they\u2019re always working together. Right now, what this means is that you can switch to a true 2x zoom by tapping on a button, which is very nice. You can also digitally zoom the 1x lens to 2x, where the telephoto takes over, and then digitally zoom the 2x lens to 10x. Digital zoom is still digital zoom; anything past 4x definitely looks like what you\u2019d expect from grainy digital zoom.\nAnd, well, that\u2019s all it really does right now. Zooming is great, but that\u2019s not the only reason to put dual cameras on a phone. Other phones with dual cameras, like the Huawei Honor 8, let you do all kinds of wild focus and depth of field adjustments, and some even let you refocus the image after the fact, like a Lytro camera. The effects can be a little fake-looking, but they\u2019re the sort of thing dual cameras enable. But the iPhone 7 Plus doesn\u2019t do any of that, although a forthcoming software update will enable a portrait mode that blurs the background into what looks like a very nice bokeh.\nClick on individual images to see full width\nEven that is just scratching the surface of what can be done with two cameras on a phone with as much processing power as the iPhone 7 Plus, and I\u2019m really hoping Apple allows third-party developers to tap into the system and experiment with possibilities like refocusing and perspective shifts. But for now, you get zooming. We spent a lot of time shooting with the 7 Plus, and it gets noticeably warm when you use the cameras for an extended period; it takes a lot of processing power to meld those two cameras into a single unit. I\u2019m very curious to see the impact on heat and battery life when Apple enables features beyond zooming.\nApple has been blowing up iPhone photos to billboard sizes and crowing about its cameras for years now, so at this point the opportunity for improvement is fairly small. I took a few photos with the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 6S Plus under decent light and asked people to tell them apart on a laptop screen. It was pretty hard for most everyone, although the 7 definitely has more vibrant colors and a noticeably shallower depth of field because of the brighter lens. You can tell if you know what to look for, but the difference in most shots will be imperceptible in an Instagram or Facebook feed.\nClick on individual images to see full width\nFront cameras are almost more important than rear cameras in our Instagram Stories world, and the iPhone 7\u2019s front camera is excellent, with a new 7-megapixel sensor replacing the 5-megapixel unit in the 6S. The lens is not quite as wide angle as Samsung\u2019s cameras, but it\u2019s bright, sharp, and the Retina Flash is still a terrific idea that was absolutely worth lifting from Snapchat. It's a solid improvement, and a welcome one.\nWe conducted some pretty extensive camera testing against a Samsung Galaxy Note 7, an iPhone 6S Plus, a Fuji XT10, and a Canon 5D MkIII \u2014 you can see the results for yourself. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus clearly hold their own, but I don\u2019t think they blow the pack away. That might all change when Apple starts taking more advantage of the dual cameras, but for now, I don\u2019t think the 7 Plus will keep anyone away from a mirrorless rig. Which is exactly what I said about the iPhone 6S last year.\nPerformance\nThe iPhone 7 has the new A10 Fusion chip, another product from Apple\u2019s industry-leading chip design team. It\u2019s a new design with four cores: two high performance cores, and two low-power cores that use less battery power during everyday tasks.\nIt\u2019s lightning-fast, of course, with early benchmarks indicating that the A10 Fusion is faster than even the A9X in the iPad Pro. But In my super boring day-to-day Twitter / Facebook / Gmail / Slack / Safari usage, the iPhone 7 Plus wasn\u2019t really all that much faster than the A9 chip in the iPhone 6S Plus \u2014 likely because I wasn\u2019t pushing the processor enough to use the high-performance cores. It\u2019s impressive that Apple was able to create a more efficient processor that delivers the same perceived performance as the previous generation while using less power, but that also means that in everyday use I didn\u2019t see anything like the performance leaps that were so noticeable in previous iPhone updates.\nStill, faster is better, and once app developers start targeting the A10 Fusion, we might see a new wave of apps that harness its raw power. But that\u2019s a familiar waiting game we\u2019ve been playing with ever-faster iOS devices for years now.\nApple claims that a combination of a larger battery that fills some of the space formerly used by the headphone jack, the more efficient processor, and iOS 10 improvements allows the iPhone 7 to run for two more hours than the iPhone 6S, and the 7 Plus to go for an hour longer than the 6S Plus. That was mostly borne out in my day-to-day testing, which saw the smaller phone run for about 10 hours of medium usage and the larger iPhone 7 Plus go for about 12 hours. Under a heavier load, I get the sense that battery life will be more like the 6S models, but those extra hours will be meaningful for those desperate moments on the way home from work.\niOS 10\nSpeaking of iOS 10, it\u2019s wonderful. Seriously, it\u2019s the nicest iOS update in a long time, with a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. We\u2019ll have much more about iOS 10 in a forthcoming review, but know that it has a slick new version of iMessage with all kinds of new features, a new version of Siri that can be extended by third-party apps, better integration with smart home devices, a much-improved Control Center, better Music and News apps, and a ton of other new features.\n(As an aside: my personal favorite iOS 10 tweak is that Apple has gotten rid of slide-to-unlock because the Touch ID sensor on the 6S and 7 is so fast \u2014 sliding to the right from the lock screen now brings you to a widget screen. You unlock the phone just by pressing the home button, which is enough time for Touch ID to recognize your fingerprint. Apple\u2019s slide-to-unlock patent was at the center of many of their lawsuits against Android phone makers, and I once made an entire video exploring how Android phones were carefully designed around that patent. And now it\u2019s gone, because Apple figured out a better idea that\u2019s genuinely useful.)\nConclusion\nDown to brass tacks: do all of the new features of the iPhone 7 make up for the inconvenience of the missing headphone jack? This may or may not surprise you, but I don\u2019t think so \u2014 not yet.\nThe iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company\u2019s vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal. And the batteries last longer. These are terrific phones.\nThese are terrific phones\nBut they are also incomplete. The most interesting feature of the iPhone 7 Plus\u2019 new dual camera isn\u2019t shipping at launch. Apple\u2019s making a big bet on iMessage and Siri apps in iOS 10 but it hasn\u2019t paid off yet. Apps haven\u2019t been updated to use the Taptic Engine or the new wide color gamut display. The entire ecosystem of new headphones and adapters required to make use of Lightning and wireless audio is just getting off the ground. Only Apple or Beats headphones offer the best wireless audio experience, and you might not like how they sound or fit. By the time developers even come close to hitting the performance limits of the A10 Fusion chip, Apple will be shipping the A11 Fusion Pro with six blades.\nThe entire time I was using the iPhone 7, I felt like I had a prototype of next year\u2019s rumored drastic iPhone redesign disguised as an iPhone 6. All those bold bets on the future are legitimately exciting, but here in the present using the iPhone 7 in a case feels a lot like using a iPhone 6S with a weirder home button and more adapters.\nBut they are also incomplete\nIf you need a new phone right now, sure, buy an iPhone 7. The little one starts at $649 for a mercifully doubled 32GB of storage and ranges up to $849 for 256GB, and the Plus starts at $769 for 32GB and goes up to $969 for 256GB. Make sure you factor in the extra cost of headphone adapters or Bluetooth headphones, because you\u2019ll end up needing them. You\u2019ll be fine, and your photos will be better.\nBut unless you\u2019re eager and ready to live the early adopter life, you won\u2019t actually be missing out on much if you don\u2019t get an iPhone 7. This is an iPhone that lays a marker in tech history, and it will serve as the foundation for many important changes to how phones work and integrate into our lives. We\u2019re going to remember the iPhone 7.\nIt\u2019s going to be the next iPhones that actually build a useful future on that foundation.\niPhone 7 and 7 Plus\nGood Stuff\nWater resistance\nImproved cameras\nBetter battery life\nGreat display\nTaptic engine feedback is neat\nDual camera zoom on the 7 Plus is great\nBad Stuff",

        "body": "In a statement given to BuzzFeed's John Paczkowski, Apple says the issue that was causing iOS 10 updates installed over-the-air to fail on some iPads and iPhones has been resolved, making it safe to resume iOS 10 downloads.\n\"We experienced a brief issue with the software update process, affecting a small number of users during the first hour of availability. The problem was quickly resolved and we apologize to those customers. Anyone who was affected should connect to iTunes to complete the update or contact AppleCare for help.\nShortly after iOS 10 was released, a number of people who attempted to install iOS 10 using an over-the-air download saw their installation fail, effectively bricking devices until plugged into iTunes for an update or restore. For people who are not near a computer or who do not own one, this is a significant problem.\nUsers who were already affected by the problem will need to continue on with the restore process using a computer, but new users who attempt to install the update should not run into the problem.\nApple recommends creating a backup before installing any new iOS update, and those worried about having the install fail can instead download the update through iTunes, an installation method that has not been affected.",

        "title": "Blind Apple Store Employee Upgrades My iPhone",
        "body": "While the iPhone 7 has some incredible engineering advances, it\u2019s obvious Apple\u2019s retail systems are intensely challenged by its annual upgrade cycle. In addition to its limited product availability, its website misdirected T-Mobile customers to visit Apple stores to join its upgrade program and attorneys for existing upgrade program members have filed a class action lawsuit against the company.\nAfter showing up at an Apple store to sign up for an upgrade, staff told me I\u2019d have to order one online and return with it. So, that\u2019s what I did. But somehow I knew it still wouldn\u2019t be easy. Apple and T-Mobile\u2019s systems don\u2019t really talk to each other as well as they do with other carriers.\nIn fact, my upgrade was so complicated that at one point, five blue-shirted Apple Store employees encircled me.\nOne was blind.\nStan and Eclaire\nThe Apple store was so busy when I arrived that it was hard to even find an available staff member. The first one I spoke to directed me to wait at a table where another employee introduced me to Stan.\nThere was something very professional about the way the employee checked in with me and with Stan about my case. Stan was new to the store and I think they wanted to make sure he felt he could handle it (and also that I was comfortable having a blind person help me.)\nOne of the first things that struck me walking into this narrow, mall-based Apple store was how crowded and noisy it was. Since the blind rely more than the rest of us on their hearing, I was impressed that Stan was comfortable working here.\nHe introduced himself (and his dog Eclaire). Despite the cacophony around us, Eclaire quietly curled up beneath our table. Even though Stan said it was okay and I wanted to pet him, I thought it was best to respect him in his role as a service dog.\nI explained the challenge to Stan and he began working my case. He had headphones he\u2019d wear at times as he used what I think was an iPhone SE in a wraparound hardware device with a scroll wheel. I could see red rectangles around list items moving about as he worked the device asking questions as we went.\nWhile I knew it might take a bit longer for Stan to help me, it touched me that he was here \u2014 working frontline retail of a crowded noisy Apple store, home of the most successful technology company in the world.\nSomething warmed my heart about him (and Eclaire) and I was happy to have his help.\nMy Anxiety Writing About the Blind\nWhile Stan gave me his permission to write about him, I\u2019m a bit anxious about it.\nBlind people are fully integrated into our society, right?\nI\u2019d once worked with a blind software developer at Microsoft in the 90s who was both remarkably kind and intelligent. The blind have the same capabilities of everyone else (aside from not being able to see.) Maybe there\u2019s nothing unusual about blind retail employees. What\u2019s my deal? Would I belittle Stan by raising him up as \u201cspecial\u201d?\nBut, I can\u2019t remember having a retail interaction with a blind person before Stan. And, it turns out that the blind aren\u2019t fully integrated into our society. The National Federation for the Blind estimates that about 70% are unemployed.\nAnd honestly, the thought of blindness scares me more than pretty much anything. I remember one particularly sleepless night leading up to my prior year brain surgery where I realized that with the surgeon opening my skull and operating on my left optic nerve, I could go blind and I hadn\u2019t asked her what risk I faced. Waking up repeatedly in fear of blindness was the scariest moment for me of my whole surgical and radiation experience.\nMy surgeon later told me she thought it was about a three percent possibility of blindness in my left eye \u2014 and I felt I could manage with that low level of risk.\nBut certainly, part of my fear of blindness is because I haven\u2019t spent much time with blind people. What we don\u2019t know often scares us.\nI also have two friends who lost an eye during childhood. I\u2019ve often wondered how they go about their lives without the comfort in the redundancy of two eyes.\nSomething Special is Happening Here\nAfter a few minutes, another Apple staff member wandered up to Stan with an iPhone 7 box with my name on it.\nPretty quickly it became obvious that even the hardware engineers behind the brilliance of the iPhone 7 would be unable to sign up a T-Mobile customer for Apple\u2019s upgrade program. Stan and Eclaire and I would need more help.\nStan called for his colleague Jay over the store\u2019s secret service-like employee network. Jay came right away and escorted us to a table with a special iPad. Eclaire diligently followed.\nThe warmth and support between Jay and Stan touched me as well. Stan called Jay his adopted son and Jay put a hand on his shoulder.\nJay would navigate Apple and T-Mobile\u2019s retail systems and Stan would point out things he missed as we went along.\nBetween the seventeen times Jay asked me to enter my name, email address and social security number, we all took turns making jokes. At one point, Stan told Jay he wanted to verify something and took a close look at the screen before returning it to him and saying it looked okay.\nBut even with Jay\u2019s help we got stuck. And when Jay called for a manager on the wire, two other employees came over to see what was up and offer their assistance. When the manager came by, I could tell she also cared for Stan and was glad to have him on the team. Something special was happening here in this Apple store.\nIt was obvious that Stan can do the job well and everyone was glad to have him \u2014 but he was also being welcomed and supported to help him be successful.\nThe camaraderie between the staff and Stan was palpable.\nAt one point the manager came over and told Stan he was going on lunch break after my case. And while I\u2019m sure she says this to a lot of employees \u2014 there was a warm respectful regard in her voice that we probably don\u2019t regularly hear.\nWhat Can We Learn From Stan\nI asked Stan about the noise in the store and whether it was difficult to work there. He said he just stays focused and enjoys the peace and quiet at the end of the day at home with Eclaire and his other dog.\nHe said he\u2019d worked at Apple for six years but had recently moved. After 25 years in one state, he said, \u201cI needed a change.\u201d Which ironically is how I found myself to be at his store \u2014 after 25 years, I\u2019d recently left my home state. It\u2019s difficult finding your way in a new city \u2014 I spent twenty minutes looking for the right bus stop downtown the other day, and I can see. I can\u2019t imagine the courage to do this as a blind person.\nWith all of the pain coming to the surface recently of police violence on black men that iPhones and similar devices have helped reveal to America, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about my own privilege. And, for me, sight is a dear privilege. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d live without it. It\u2019s scary for me to ponder.\nAnd, it\u2019s Stan and Eclaire\u2019s \u201ceveryday.\u201d\nRecently, I\u2019d read about a young Apple accessibility engineer named Jordyn Castor. It\u2019s hard to watch her share her story of arriving in New York city in this video without teary eyes, a warm heart and a sense of inspiration. Just watching her walk down stairs blind makes me think about her \u201ceveryday.\u201d In it, she challenges herself to find her way in America\u2019s most populous city. And, now she\u2019s helping making apps that teach programming accessible to blind children.\nI\u2019ve always known Apple is proactive at accessibility \u2014 but in this moment with Stan and Eclaire and the team he was becoming a part of, I felt that the company is doing something impressive here and I\u2019m glad to be their customer.\nSimilarly, I was touched by all the people who take part in raising and training dogs like Eclaire to support their humans \u2014 and to the animals themselves for their commitment.\nThe Timeliness of Empathy\nPassing the Macy\u2019s on the way to the mall that day was kind of evocative. A shooter had shot and killed five people at a Macy\u2019s in Washington State the night before and was still at large. And, I\u2019d been listening to On the Media discuss the return of white supremacy in the shadow of Donald Trump. I\u2019d also been moved by the video of Keith Lamont Scott\u2019s death in Charlotte. Police are killing black men regularly and laws aren\u2019t changing to offer them equal protection. The anger and rage of all Americans right now is in a painful place.\nI believe that one major component of the path forward for all of us is empathy. When you don\u2019t reflect on what it\u2019s like to be in someone else\u2019s shoes, you don\u2019t begin to understand the challenges before them \u2014 or the fear or the losses.\nAnd from empathy comes compassion and mutual regard. You can see it in this particular Apple store in how Stan and his co-workers support each other.\nIf I heard Stan spell Eclaire\u2019s name correctly, he\u2019s not named after the yummy pastry but Google tells me that Eclaire is French for enlightened. His name makes more sense to me now.\nDiscussing the iPhone 7 last week, John Gruber quoted Steve Jobs, \u201cMost people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it\u2019s this veneer \u2014 that the designers are handed this box and told, \u2018Make it look good!\u2019 That\u2019s not what we think design is. It\u2019s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.\u201d\nI think Jobs would be proud to see the design of the iPhone 7 working from the inside out into this particular Apple retail store.\nPostscript: I don\u2019t want to ignore that there remain many unknowns about Apple\u2019s overseas labor practices. Coincidentally the day I woke up to go to the Apple store, I began wondering where my clothes are made, really. While my socks are made in the USA, my shirt, pants, boxers and shoes were all made in either China or Vietnam. Still, I\u2019d pay extra for an iPhone made here (and of course, that\u2019s partly because I can afford to.)",

        "title": "discovering how Dropbox hacks your mac",
        "body": "Update: Dropbox hack blocked by Apple in Sierra\nFollowing my post revealing Dropbox\u2019s Dirty Little Security Hack a few weeks ago, I thought I\u2019d look deeper into how Dropbox was getting around Apple\u2019s security.\nAfter a little digging around in Apple\u2019s vast documentation, it occurred to me to check the authorization database and see if that had been tampered with. According to the docs:\nIn a policy-based system, a user requests authorization\u2014the act of granting a right or privilege\u2014to perform a privileged operation. Authorization is performed through an agent so the user doesn\u2019t have to trust the application with a password. The agent is the user interface\u2014 operating on behalf of the Security Server\u2014used to obtain the user\u2019s password or other form of identification, which also ensures consistency between applications. The Security Server\u2014a Core Services daemon in OS X that deals with authorization and authentication\u2014determines whether no one, everyone, or only certain users may perform a privileged operation.\nThe list of authorization \u201crights\u201d used by the system to manage this \u201cpolicy based system\u201d is held in /var/db/auth.db database, and a backup or default copy is retained in /System/Library/Security/authorization.plist.\nLooking at the default with\ndefaults read /System/Library/Security/authorization.plist\nwe can find that there is an authorization right for System Preferences\u2019 Accessibility list, which says:\n\"system.preferences.accessibility\" = {\nclass = user;\ncomment = \"Checked when making changes to the Accessibility Preferences.\";\ngroup = admin;\nshared = 0;\ntimeout = 0;\nThat file\u2019s comments also state that \u201cThe allow-root property specifies whether a right should be allowed automatically if the requesting process is running with uid == 0. This defaults to false if not specified.\u201d\nIn other words, if allow-root isn\u2019t explicitly set, the default is that even a process with root user privileges does not have the right to perform that operation. Since that\u2019s not specified in the default shown above, then even root couldn\u2019t add Dropbox to the list of apps in Accessibility preferences. Is it possible then, that Dropbox had overriden this setting in the auth.db? Let\u2019s go and check!\nTo see what the current policies are, you have to actually read the sql database in /var/db/auth.db. There\u2019s various ways of doing that, but the easiest for me was to access auth.db through the command line using the security tool. Issuing the following command in Terminal will return us the currently active policy for Accessibility:\nsecurity authorization read system.preferences.accessibility\nOn my machine, this returned:\nRoot wasn\u2019t allowed to override Accessibility, and authenticate was on, so it couldn\u2019t be this way that Dropbox was hacking my mac.\nSecurity on OS X is a complex beast, however, and there are other authorization protocols at work. One that I already knew of is tccutil. If you issue man tccutil in Terminal, you\u2019ll see this:\ntccutil(1) BSD General Commands Manual tccutil(1) NAME\ntccutil \u2014 manage the privacy database SYNOPSIS\ntccutil command service DESCRIPTION\nThe tccutil command manages the privacy database, which stores decisions the user has made about\nwhether apps may access personal data. One command is current supported: reset Reset all decisions for the specified service, causing apps to prompt again the next time\nthey access the service. EXAMPLES\nTo reset all decisions about whether apps may access the address book: tccutil reset AddressBook Darwin April 3, 2012 Darwin\n(END)\nI had heard of a hack of this utility that was related directly to adding apps to Accessibility list over a year ago when I stumbled across this stackexchange page. In short, what that hack suggests is that you modify tcc directly by inserting an entry into the sql database located here /Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db .\nYou can read the current list with the command:\nsudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 'select * from access' .\nTo insert an app in the list, you grab it\u2019s bundle identifier (in the case of Dropbox, that\u2019s com.getdropbox.dropbox), and issue:\nsudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db \u201cREPLACE INTO access VALUES(\u2018kTCCServiceAccessibility\u2019,\u2019com.getdropbox.dropbox\u2019,0,1,1,NULL, NULL);\u201d\n(*note the code given on the stackexchange page isn\u2019t quite correct for the latest builds of the mac operating system, in which the access table now has 7 columns and so requires and extra \u201cNULL\u201d on the end as shown above).\nI tested this with several of my own apps and found it worked reliably. It\u2019ll even work while System Preferences is open, which is exactly the behaviour I saw with Dropbox.\nIt remained to prove, though, that this was indeed the hack that Dropbox was using, and so I started to look at what exactly Dropbox did after being given an admin password on installation or launch. Using DetectX, I was able to see that Dropbox added a new folder to my /Library folder after the password was entered:\nAs can be seen, instead of adding something to the PrivilegedHelperTools folder as is standard behaviour for apps on the mac that need elevated privileges for one or two specialist operations, Dropbox installs its own folder containing these interesting items:\nNot one, but three binaries! I wonder what they do? The first thing I did on each was to run the strings command on them. I still haven\u2019t determined what that 1.5MB DropboxHelperInstaller binary is doing (that\u2019s pretty big for a binary for a helper app), but its jam-packed with strings relating to file compression and encryption. The string output for dbfseventsd binary didn\u2019t reveal anything much interesting, but with the deliciously named dbaccessperm file, we finally hit gold and the exact proof I was looking for that Dropbox was using a sql attack on the tcc database to circumvent Apple\u2019s authorization policy:\nThis is all the more telling when we look at what Dropbox themselves say when queried about why their app is in the list of Accessibility apps here. After a great deal of obfuscation, misdirection and irrelevance in which they mention everything about permissions in general and nothing about Accessibility in particular, or that they\u2019re hacking their way into the user\u2019s Accessibility list rather than going through the supported channel of presenting the user with a dialog box and asking for permission, comes this line:\nwe need to request all the permissions we need or even may need in the future.\n(my emphasis)\nOstensibly, that\u2019s in the context of Drobpox on mobile apps, but since the question isn\u2019t related to mobile apps at all, I think interpreting anything said there as being honest is naive at best. What I do suspect, especially in light of the fact that there just doesn\u2019t seem to be any need for Dropbox to have Accessibility permissions, is that it\u2019s in there just in case they want that access in the future. If that\u2019s right, it suggests that Dropbox simply want to have access to anything and everything on your mac, whether it\u2019s needed or not.\nThe upshot for me was that I learned a few things about how security and authorisation work on the mac that I didn\u2019t know before investigating what Dropbox was up to. But most of all, I learned that I don\u2019t trust Dropbox at all. Unnecessary privileges and backdooring are what I call untrustworthy behaviour and a clear breach of user trust. With Apple\u2019s recent stance against the FBI and their commitment to privacy in general, I feel moving over to iCloud and dropping Dropbox is a far more sensible way to go for me. For those of you who are stuck with Dropbox but don\u2019t want to allow it access to Accessibility features, you can thwart Dropbox\u2019s hack by following my procedure here.\n\ud83d\ude42\nFurther Reading:\nDropbox hack blocked by Apple in Sierra\nRevealing Dropbox\u2019s Dirty Little Security Hack\nHackers steal over 60m Dropbox user account passwords\nHow keyloggers get around OSX Security",

Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use. If you are concerned about this, we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iPhone.\nSo the jet black iPhone 7 will still be as hard as the other iPhones and likely as durable, but it seems scratching was enough of an issue in Apple\u2019s own tests that it thought of putting the warning for those considering the model.\nHere\u2019s a comparison of the new colors including the glossy jet black and black models:\nThe new jet black model is the only variation of the new iPhone that is limited to 128GB and 256GB capacities, while other color options\u2014 silver, black, gold, and rose gold\u2014 will be available in 32GB as well.\nCheck out full iPhone 7 specs, pricing, and availability details.",

        "body": "One of the challenges Apple faced with making the Apple Watch Series 2 \u2018swimproof\u2018 was that it has two large-ish holes in the casing in the form of the speaker grilles. The company said during the keynote that it actually used sound waves to eject water from the speaker enclosure, and we can now see this happening in full slow-motion glory in a YouTube video.\nSome other aspects of the waterproofing are rather less hi-tech: an iFixit teardown of the Watch revealed that it uses much stronger adhesive, as well as additional gaskets and o-rings.\nThe revised Watch does seem to be living up to its claims, with many reviewers taking it for a swim \u2013 including our own Zac Hall.\nApple\u2019s claims for the improved water-resistance of the iPhone 7 are more modest, but that hasn\u2019t stopped us seeing a variety of OTT water-related tests.\nEven before the release of the Series 2, Kantar reported that the Apple Watch was retaining its dominance of the smartwatch market, accounting for a full third of U.S. sales.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgTs8ywKQsI",

        "title": "AirPods will work with non-Apple devices as standard Bluetooth earbuds",
        "body": "Those new AirPods will work with non-Apple devices But you probably won't want to use them that way.\nDespite listing software requirements to the contrary in yesterday's press release, The Verge reports that Apple's new AirPods will work with devices other than its own. By doing so, you'll forfeit the proximity pairing feature that using the wireless earbuds with an iPhone affords and you won't be able to use Siri. During yesterday's announcement, the official PR for the audio accessories listed software requirements of iOS 10, watchOS 3 or macOS Sierra. However, it seems that's only the case if you want to employ all the tools AirPods have to offer.\nApple says that using the AirPods with a device from another manufacturer is pretty dull. The company explained to The Verge that the in-ears \"just lose the magic when not used with an Apple device.\" Of course, that \"magic\" is the quick connection, a virtual assistant and the ability to move easily between devices without having to re-pair them. It sounds like the earbuds will function as basic Bluetooth headphones if you connect them to a non-Apple gadget. The AirPods go on sale next month for $159 so you won't have to wait long to see how little \"magic\" there is when you use them with an Android device.\nWe've reached out to Apple for more information on the matter and we'll update this post when/if we hear back.",

        "title": "iPhone 7 sales are much stronger than expected, seems like a headphone jack isn't necessary after all",
        "body": "The iPhone 7 is turning out to be a more successful and popular device than most analysts could have imagined. Indeed, many analysts were of the mind that the iPhone 7 would usher in a lackluster if not disappointing upgrade cycle. As it turns out, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\nAs we covered previously, pre-orders for Apple\u2019s new iPhone 7 models completely blew away expectations at Sprint, T-Mobile and AT&T. What\u2019s more, Apple a few days ago said that all iPhone 7 Plus models and all Jet Black iPhone 7 models were already sold out from in-store supply. In other words, if you don\u2019t already have an existing pre-order, you may have to wait a while for an iPhone 7 Plus or a Jet Black iPhone 7.\nWith demand for the iPhone 7 soaring, one has to wonder how and why so many analysts managed to get everything so wrong? My personal take is that analysts became too pre-occupied with fancy new features and completely ignored two important factors: a) the iPhone 7 offers tremendous performance improvements and b) the pool of existing iPhone users in the market for an upgrade was vastly underestimated.\nDON\u2019T MISS: 14 awesome iOS 10 tips and hidden features you weren\u2019t aware of\nTo the first point, there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the iPhone 7 essentially looks identical to the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6; but that\u2019s no reason to dismiss the iPhone 7 out of hand. Underneath the hood, the iPhone 7 is an incredibly compelling device and offers up mind-boggling improvements in performance, long-overdue improvements to battery life, and vastly superior camera technology. So while some pundits were quick to label the iPhone 7 as a boring upgrade because it didn\u2019t introduce a funky new design aesthetic, they completely underestimated the fact that users will tolerate a familiar design if the device itself represents a huge leap forward in other respects.\nAs John Gruber insightfully pointed out earlier this week:\nThere is a large contingent of pundits who apparently would be more excited about a new iPhone that looked entirely different but had the exact same components as the iPhone 6S than they are by the actual iPhones 7, which are shaped like the 6S but have amazing new components. I don\u2019t get that mindset at all. It\u2019s like being a car pundit and judging the new Porsche 911 with a \u201cmeh\u201d because it looks like the previous 911, and never even considering what it\u2019s like to actually drivethe new car.\nTo the second point, most analysts did not seem to appreciate that the release of the iPhone 6 ushered in a massive refresh cycle, luring in users who for some time had been waiting for Apple to release a larger-screened iPhone. That was two years ago and now all of those iPhone 6 owners are back in the market for a new device. Also, consider this: the jump in functionality from the iPhone 6 to the iPhone 7 is far greater than the jump we saw from the iPhone 5s to the iPhone 6s. In other words, Apple\u2019s iPhone release this year is much more alluring to users on a 2-year upgrade cycle than the iPhone 6s was last year.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that at least one analyst got things right: analyst Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. In a research note put out this past June, Long astutely pointed out that the percentage of iPhone owners with devices more than two years old was at an all-time high and was much greater than what we saw in the months leading up to the iPhone 6 and 6s release. According to Long\u2019s estimates, 120 million iPhone users as of June 2016 were using iPhone 5s devices or even older models.\nAll the while, analysts also seemed to ignore that Apple told component suppliers to get ready for an iPhone production target in the 72 to 78 million range, making it the \u201chighest production target in about two years.\u201d Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, were initially projecting iPhone 7 production to fall in the 65 million range.\nApple said it won\u2019t be releasing iPhone 7 weekend launch sales figures this Monday, so we\u2019ll likely have to wait until the company\u2019s earnings report in October before we get a firmer read on the iPhone 7\u2019s popularity.",
