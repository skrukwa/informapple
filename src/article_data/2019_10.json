        "body": "TAIPEI (Taiwan News) \u2014 Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook is the new chairman of the Advisory Board of the School of Economics and Management (SEM) of Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.\nAccording to Tsinghua University SEM\u2019s public WeChat account, the 20th meeting of the advisory board was held at the Beijing campus on Oct. 18. The meeting was chaired by Cook, with 35 members in attendance.\nCook\u2019s role will be to promote development of the college and make it a world-class economic management school. His mandate will last from 2019 to 2022.\nThe advisory board was established in 2000. It comprises entrepreneurs, business school deans, scholars, leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and financial departments.\nThe day before the advisory board meeting, Cook met with Xiao Ya-qing (\u8096\u4e9e\u6176), director of China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation in Beijing. According to the bureau\u2019s official website, \"The two sides have conducted in-depth exchanges on expanding investment and business development in China, protecting consumer rights and fulfilling corporate social responsibility.\"\nApple actively operates within the Chinese market. Although Cook has met with high-level Chinese executive officials in recent years, many of Apple\u2019s initiatives have been \"looked down on\" by China, according to CNA.\nApple was recently forced by the CCP to remove a crowdsourced map service from its App Store that allowed Hong Kong protesters to track police activity. Cook defended the removal in an email to employees and emphasized the app was removed for illegal use.\nEarlier this month, the Taiwan flag emoji disappeared from Hong Kong and Macau iPhone users\u2019 keyboards after a software update. At the same time, the U.S. online media Quartz, which was reporting on the Hong Kong protests, was removed from the Chinese version of the App Store.\nNews of Cook\u2019s new role comes during trade war talks between the U.S. and China. According to Liberty Times, some netizens have remarked that Cook is \u201cwasting his time trying to stabilize the Chinese market.\u201d",

        "title": "Mac Report: 'AirPods Pro' to Launch End of October with New Design, New Noise-Canceling Feature and $260 Price Tag",
        "body": "Apple's rumored next-generation noise-canceling AirPods will launch at the end of this month with a new \"Pro\" moniker and a price tag of around $260, claims a new Chinese-language report this morning.\nAccording to China Economic Daily, Apple's third-generation AirPods will adopt a new in-ear design to support the new noise-canceling feature and enhance the listening experience. The paper claims the \"Pro\" suffix, which Apple recently adopted for its most expensive iPhone 11 models, will help to differentiate the new wireless earbuds from Apple's existing AirPods and underscores the marketing rationale justifying the higher $260 price tag.\nAccording to a separate report on Friday from the same Chinese-language financial media outlet, the AirPods Pro will also feature a new metal design that increases heat dissipation. Apple AirPods supplier Inventec is said to be cooperating with Chinese manufacturer Lixun to undertake the new orders.\nIn April, noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said two new AirPods models would likely go into mass production between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, with Luxshare, Goertek, and Amkor serving as primary suppliers.\nKuo also claimed one of the new AirPods models will feature an \"all-new form factor design\" and a \"higher price\" than the second-generation AirPods, which cost $159 with a standard charging case and $199 with a wireless charging case. The other model is expected to be a more iterative update with the same pricing, although it's unclear what any new features would be.\nPreviously, the AirPods expected to launch later this year were thought to be the more iterative pair that Kuo refers to. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said he expects the higher-priced AirPods with water resistance and noise cancelation to launch as early as 2020. However, today's report suggests they could come sooner.\nAccording to industry sources previously cited by DigiTimes, Apple's suppliers are gearing up to assemble the next-generation AirPods as early as October, suggesting an updated version of the earphones could arrive in time for the holiday shopping season.\nIn the beta version of iOS 13.2 there's an icon showing redesigned AirPods that appear to have rubber ear tips that would likely be needed as part of a noise cancelation feature. The image is contained in the Accessibility Settings folder, suggesting the new AirPods will contain a new accessibility feature such as being able to use them as hearing aids, or it could be related to existing Live Listen capabilities.\nNo specific date has been given for when the new AirPods could debut, but Apple has a number of rumored pending announcements that could point toward an October media event.",

        "title": "Update: Apple reinstates Hong Kong protest app that it called \u2018illegal\u2019",
        "body": "There is controversy today after Apple removed a Hong Kong protest app from the App Store. The developers claim that the app helps people avoid trouble spots and comply with the law, while Apple says that it\u2019s intended to circumvent the law.\nIt\u2019s currently unclear whether Apple made its own decision to remove the HKmap Live app, or whether it acted at the request of the Chinese government\u2026\nUpdate 10/4: Apple has reversed its decision and brought back the Hong Kong protest app, HKmap Live. The developers shared the following in a tweet, \u201cThanks everyone, @Apple finally made the right decision. Will update later as things are going crazy in #HK now.\u201d\nThe developers tweeted an apparent quote from Apple, explaining why the app was pulled.\n\u201cYour app contains content \u2014 or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity \u2014 that is not legal\u2026 Specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement.\u201d @Apple assume our user are lawbreakers and therefore evading law enforcement, which is clearly not the case.\nA follow-up tweet suggested it was perhaps an error on the part of Apple.\nTo make it clear, I still believe this is more a bureaucratic f up than censorship.\nHKmap Live let people track police activity on the streets of Hong Kong, and could clearly be used in two very different ways.\nIt could be used by protesters who want to evade the police, or it could be used to allow citizens to avoid trouble spots where there is a danger of being caught up in conflicts between the police and protesters.\nThat latter argument has been bolstered by a violent clash earlier this week, where protesters threw objects at police officers, and one of those officers shot a protester in the chest with live rounds, as the Independent reported.\nA protester has been shot in the chest as police fired live rounds during clashes in Hong Kong, according to activists and local media. The Demosisto protest group shared a video on social media that appeared to show a police officer firing a handgun into the chest of an approaching protester at near-point-blank range. The video, captured and posted online by a Hong Kong University student union group, showed the police officer was surrounded by protesters throwing objects when he opened fire. A police official confirmed an officer had opened fire in the Tsuen Wan area, and that a protester had been hit. The man\u2019s friend told reporters he was in a critical condition at Princess Margaret hospital in Kwai Chung. It is the first time a protester has been struck by police live fire since the political unrest began in June, though officers have fired warning shots into the air on several occasions in the past.\nThe Register notes that developers could also argue that the Hong Kong protest app is entirely in line with official police policy.\nHong Kong citizens have highlighted a quirk of local laws that provide a strong counterargument: Under the law, the Hong Kong police are obliged to wave a blue flag at the spot in which they wish to declare that an illegal gathering is taking place. The intent is to give citizens sufficient notice and time to move away from the area before any police action is taken. The HKmap Live app simply takes that official approach and extends it to citizens, allowing them to notify others of action that will be taken in specific locations.\nWhile Apple may have complied with a request from the Chinese authorities, it seems odd that the same information is still available on the web.",

        "title": "Kuo: Apple to release 'iPhone SE 2' in Q1 2020 with iPhone 8 design, A13 processor",
        "body": "Apple is set to launch the next version of the iPhone SE 2 in the first quarter of 2020, according to renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The new phone will be more affordable than the rest of the Apple iPhone lineup and feature newer internals, like an A13 processor with 3 GB RAM, in a familiar iPhone 8 chassis.\nKuo says that most of the new iPhone SE\u2019s hardware specification will mirror the iPhone 8. The analyst predicts Apple will sell 30-40 million units across 2020.\nThe Q1 timeframe lines up with a previous report from Nikkei, which said to expect a cheaper iPhone with iPhone 8-esque design in the spring. This would mean it would feature a 4.7-inch LCD display and Touch ID home button.\nKuo does not predict an exact price for the new phone. Before the 4-inch iPhone SE was discontinued, Apple sold it for $349 in a 32 GB storage configuration.\nThe current iPhone product range at Apple stores spans the iPhone 11 series, iPhone XR and the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The 4.7-inch iPhone 8 is currently on sale for $449 for 64 GB.\nPresumably, when the new SE launches, Apple will stop selling the iPhone 8 altogether. Given the current pricing of the 8, you could easily see how Apple could sell an iPhone SE 2 32 GB for around the same price as the old SE, in the $349-$399 range.\nKuo notes that the key target market for the new iPhone SE would be iPhone 6 owners. A spec-bumped iPhone 8 appeals to people who are not fussed about the latest iPhone features like Face ID or multi-camera modules, but do want a fast and speedy iPhone experience able to take advantage of the latest iOS features.\nNotably, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are not eligible to upgrade to iOS 13. Kuo notes that there may be \u201curgent replacement demand\u201d for users who want to upgrade to get the latest iOS 13 features. One such example is Apple Arcade. If Apple can get iPhone 6 owners to upgrade to an A13 entry-level phone, it could also lead to increased Apple Arcade subscriptions. The A13 chip would also enable augmented-reality experiences that the older phones are not powerful enough to run.\nAn iPhone 8-sized SE will not necessarily appeal to iPhone SE users who crave the small compact 4-inch form factor. However, the iPhone 8 is still significantly smaller than any of Apple\u2019s flagships introduced since then. At the very least, it\u2019s an option for people who like small phones but still want to be able to take advantage of Apple\u2019s latest processor improvements.",

        "body": "Image: Estial Photography\nMember of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, Charles Mok, the representative of its Information Technology functional constituency, has called on Apple to lift its ban on HKmap.live.\nApple removed the app from its store on Thursday, stating that the app could be used to ambush police.\nWriting to Apple, Mok said the company has the ability to \"uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression\".\nMok said the app, which crowdsources information to allow people in Hong Kong to know where police are active, helps people avoid police brutality.\nSee: China has Apple by the iPhones\n\"HKmap.live helps HK residents, journalists, tourists etc. identify 'danger zones' and avoid being hurt by tear gas, rubber bullets, baton, bean-bag rounds, and water cannon that the Hong Kong police claims to be 'minimum force', and get real-time updates of public transport, who rely on the app to avoid being harassed and beaten up by police for no reason,\" Mok wrote.\n\"If sharing information on a real-time basis equates to encouraging criminal activity ... the same standard should also be applied to review social media apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Telegram, and Instagram, where people share similar information in real-time.\"\nResponding to news of its decision to ban HKmap.live, CEO Tim Cook reportedly sent an email to Apple employees backing the ban.\n\"The app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence,\" Cook reportedly said.\n\"We built the App Store to be a safe and trusted place for every user ... In this case, we thoroughly reviewed [the facts], and we believe this decision best protects our users.\"\nThe app is still available on the Google Play Store, and is viewable through its website.\nCupertino initially dragged its feet last week in approving the app, before abruptly reversing course and removing it on Thursday.\nTwo years ago, Apple ripped the VPN apps from its Chinese app store.\nApple makes around $3 billion in revenue from China each month.\nEarlier this week, Quartz reported Apple had removed the ability for users in Hong Kong to type the Taiwanese flag emoji in iOS 13.1. Two days later, the masthead found itself on the end of a banning, after Beijing asked for the Quartz app to be removed from the app store for mainland China. Apple complied.\nRelated Coverage",

        "title": "Apple Pay Overtakes Starbucks as Most Popular Mobile Payment Platform in the US",
        "body": "Apple Pay has overtaken the Starbucks mobile app to become the most popular mobile payment system in the United States, claims a new report out today.\nAccording to eMarketer, \u200cApple Pay\u200c became the market leader last year, when 27.7 million Americans used the app to make a purchase. Since then, however, \u200cApple Pay\u200c has grown even faster than expected.\nIn 2019, \u200cApple Pay\u200c will have 30.3 million users, or 47.3 percent of mobile payment users. That compares with Starbucks' 25.2 million customers via its mobile app in the same year, representing 39.4 percent of mobile payment users.\n\"Apple Pay has benefited from the spread of new point-of-sale (POS) systems that work with the NFC signals Apple Pay runs on,\" said eMarketer principal analyst Yory Wurmser. \"The same trend should also help Google Pay and Samsung Pay, but they will continue to split the Android market.\"\nCiting data from Digital Trends, the analysis predicts \u200cApple Pay\u200c will be available in 70 percent of U.S. retailers by the end of 2019. In contrast, the Starbucks app has commanded a 40 percent market share of mobile payments for the last few years, but growth potential is limited because it can only be used in Starbucks stores.\nTotal spending via contactless mobile payments will approach $100 billion this year in the U.S., according to eMarketer. On average, that is equivalent to a user spending $1,545 per year, up more than 24 percent over last year.\nNearly 64 million people (30 percent of all U.S. smartphone users) are expected to make use of mobile payments this year, a 9.1 percent increase over 2018. In terms of demographics, nearly 50 percent of all smartphone users are adults aged 25 to 34, so the growth of mobile payments is expected to be strongest in this age group, although digital wallet use is said to be growing across the board.\n\"Although a growing number of millennials feel secure using payment apps, virtually all still find credit and debit cards equally convenient,\" said eMarketer forecasting analyst Vincent Yip. That bodes well for Apple Card, which launched earlier this year. \u200cApple Pay\u200c is now in 47 markets and in the June quarter, started adding more new users than PayPal, with monthly transaction volume growing four times as fast.",

The new design is a mix of dark gray and black, and matches the system-wide setting in iOS 13.\nWhat this means is that Instagram\u2019s implementation of Dark Mode integrates with the iOS 13 setting itself. This means the app will automatically switch between light and dark designs based on your system setting.\nDespite Facebook updating the Instagram app with Dark Mode, the main Facebook app itself still lacks support. Given Facebook\u2019s history with updating its apps for new devices and features, it\u2019s notable to see Instagram gain Dark Mode support less than three weeks after the feature launched. Ideally, this means it will also come to the Facebook app soon.\nInstagram for iOS is available on the App Store.

        "body": "Gene Daniel Levoff, a former lawyer in charge of Apple Inc.'s insider trading policy, exits from federal court in Newark, New Jersey, U.S., on Wednesday, Feb. 20, 2019.\nFormer Apple lawyer Gene Levoff was indicted on insider trading charges, the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey said in a press release on Thursday.\nThe government in its indictment alleges that Levoff used inside information from Apple, including financial results before they were published, to trade Apple stock. He's facing six counts of securities fraud and six counts of wire fraud.\n\"This scheme to defraud Company-1 and its shareholders allowed Levoff to realize profits of approximately $227,000 on certain trades and to avoid losses of approximately $377,000 on others,\" according to the press release.\nIt continued: \"When Levoff discovered that Company-1 had posted strong revenue and net profit for a given financial quarter, he purchased large quantities of stock, which he later sold for a profit once the market reacted to the news.\"\nLevoff was one of Apple's top lawyers. He started at Apple in 2008 and was a senior director of corporate law from 2013 until 2018, according to the indictment. The trades mentioned in the indictment occurred between 2011 and 2016.\nOne of his responsibilities at Apple was making sure that Apple employees didn't do any insider trading. \"Levoff's responsibilities included ensuring compliance with Company-1's Insider Trading Policy,\" according to the indictment.\nThe indictment alleges that Levoff traded stock during a \"blackout\" period, when employees can't buy or sell stock, and that he informed Apple employees about the blackout period during the same time frame he was trading Apple stock.\nThe SEC previously charged Levoff in February in a civil case. Thursday's indictment is criminal, and each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison in addition to fines.\nApple declined to comment.\n\"After being contacted by authorities last summer we conducted a thorough investigation with the help of outside legal experts, which resulted in termination,\" Apple said about the case in February.\n\"We look forward to vigorously defending Mr. Levoff with respect to these allegations,\" Kevin Marino, Levoff's lawyer, told CNBC.\nCNBC's Jim Forkin contributed to this story.",

        "title": "Apple Sets 'Aggressive' 2022 Deadline to Bring Custom 5G Modems to iPhones",
        "body": "Apple has reportedly set an aggressive 2022 deadline to develop in-house 5G modems as part of a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design to be used in future iPhones and iPads, claims a new report today.\nAccording to Fast Company, Apple plans to have completed all the development, testing, and certification necessary by the new deadline to be able to include the modems in new iPhones the same year.\nHowever, given the arduous testing and certification process required after the chip design and fabrication is complete, a two-years deadline for the modem is \"really pushing it,\" according to the report's source, who is said to have knowledge of Apple's plans.\nThe main stumbling block is said to be the network optimization testing that's necessary to make sure the modem doesn't conflict with the wireless networks of other carriers. In addition, tests are needed to ensure compliance with global standards, not to mention the ability of the modem to satisfy FCC requirements.\nGiven those hurdles, Fast Company's source believes 2023 may be a more realistic completion date for Apple's SoC modem.\nApple agreed to acquire the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business in June, with a view to accelerating the development of its own 5G modem. A previous source claimed the iPhone maker wants to have an in-house chip ready for use in some of its products by 2021, while earlier sources reported timeframes of between 2022 and 2025.\nWhatever the timeline is and regardless of whether Apple is able to stick to it, the company's transition to custom 5G modems will likely happen in phases, starting with lower-end and older models of devices. Apple has a multiyear chipset supply agreement with Qualcomm, and a six-year patent license agreement, so it doesn't exactly have to rush the process.\nIn the meantime, Apple is expected to use Qualcomm's chips for the first 5G-enabled iPhones in 2020.",

They fell over some thorns onto a steep cliff.\nOnce it began to get dark, they decided they were going to slide down the cliff hoping they would land on solid ground. They then realized there was nothing below them but rocks along the Navesink River.\n\"We got to the bottom and that's when it was life or death,\" Prudenciano says. \"I looked down and I noticed it was a straight drop to rocks and water.\"\nPrudenciano says they hung on for their lives and he didn't think he would survive. He says Paruso dropped into the river and yelled to let him know she was hurt, but OK.\nPrudenciano's Apple Watch then detected a \"hard fall\" and called 911.\n\"I was screaming that I'm going to die because I really felt I was going to die,\" he said. \"There was no way out of this for me. I literally said my last goodbyes.\"\nPrudenciano's mother says she received three text messages letting her know there was an emergency.\nEventually Prudenciano fell into the river and landed on a rock. He suffered three fractures in his back, scratches and thorns that are still lodged in his foot.\nMiddletown police say during the rescue response, the two victims were placed on a passing boat and taken to a pier. They were transported to Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center for treatment of their injuries.",

The factory is said to be producing iPhone XR handsets, with iPhone 11 also to be added to the mix in the same facility, located near Chennai.\nThe company has just started commercial production of the iPhone XR locally at the Foxconn facility near Chennai after undertaking trials for several weeks, reflecting a move up the manufacturing value chain in India. Following this, Apple plans to start making the latest iPhone 11 series. Making the iPhone XR involves a higher level of technical skill, the executives said. Apple will export the devices to other markets after having tested the waters with the export of iPhone 6s and 7 models to Europe in the past few months.\nApple will not only remove some of its reliance on Chinese iPhone manufacturing with this move, but alsos ave money on import duty. Although those savings will not be passed on to the customer, the source notes.\nWhile Apple will be able to save around 20% in import duty through local manufacturing of the iPhone XR, the executives said this won't lead to any price drops. Apple hasn't cut prices on any of its locally made iPhones.\nApple is acutely aware that the United States and China remain in a trade war and tariffs continue to escalate, although there is cause for optimism. Moving production outof China where possible is a smart move.",

We've reached out to Google and got confirmation that this is indeed the case, but it's a \"bug\" that'll be fixed.\nRedditor u/stephenvsawyer explained that iPhones currently save photos in the new compressed and efficient HEIC format, which is smaller than Google's compressed JPEG. When uploaded to Google Photos, these pics don't need to be compressed from Original Quality to High Quality JPEG, because they're already smaller than the latter. So iPhone users are essentially getting their snaps stored on Google Photos for free, in their original size.\nWe tried to verify this claim on our end, but we hit a few roadblocks. We don't have many new iPhones at hand to test this with, and checking which media files count against storage in Google Photos and which ones don't is impossible (trust us, we've tried anything and everything).\nWe reached out to Google for comment and got a confirmation that indeed, pics captured as HEIC/HEIF aren't compressed and aren't charged against Photos' quota. A Google spokesperson told us: \"We are aware of this bug and are working to fix it.\"\nHowever, what that means remains unclear. Would Google start charging for HEIC images stored in Photos, even if they're small and don't take up much space? Would it forcibly re-convert those pics to compressed JPEG, or compress them further under the HEIC format? And will the fix apply to all HEIC images or just iPhones? (Samsung devices also support saving photos as HEIC, but that doesn't seem widely adopted by users.) All paths seem riddled with minefields.\nVia: Reddit\nThanks: Randy Campbell, Matthew, Ramit Suri\nImage credit: Cult of Mac",

        "title": "AirPods Pro to Feature New Colors, Including Black and Midnight Green, According to Chinese Report.",
        "body": "\"AirPods Pro\" will come in as many as eight colors, including White, Black, and a new Midnight Green finish to match iPhone 11 Pro models, according to a Chinese-language report from the Economic Daily News.\nAirPods Pro concept via EverythingApplePro\nGoogle's machine translation of the report is not easy to decipher, so the source of the information is unclear. Eight colors would certainly be a lot, although it is not out of the question given that Apple has made Beats headphones like the Solo3 available in over a dozen colors over the years.\nThe report also backs rumors that the AirPods Pro will feature active noise cancellation and water resistance. Last month, in the iOS 13.2 beta filesystem, MacRumors discovered an icon depicting never-before-seen, in-ear AirPods with rubber ear tips that would presumably help to block out ambient noise.\nApple plans to release the AirPods Pro in time for the holiday shopping season this year, according to the Economic Daily News, with the report claiming the earphones could be unveiled as early as next week.\nThis is not the first time the Economic Daily News has reported that Apple plans to release new AirPods in a black color, as the publication made the same claim back in February. A month later, Apple released second-generation AirPods with Hey Siri support, up to 50 percent more talk time, and an optional wireless charging case, but the black color was nowhere to be seen.\nHowever, it is worth noting that Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said Apple originally planned to release the second-generation AirPods in 2018, but they were delayed, so it is possible the black color was always intended to be for these third-generation AirPods with noise cancellation and water resistance.\nIndian blog MySmartPrice also said black AirPods were in the works back in February, claiming they would feature a matte finish with improved grip. Combined with last week's Economic Daily News report claiming that the AirPods Pro will sport a new metal design, perhaps the earphones and their charging case will look similar to the back glass of iPhone 11 Pro models, complete with matching colors.\nLeaked photos, knockoffs, and accessories all point towards the AirPods Pro charging case being wider to accommodate the ear tips.\nAs higher-end earphones, the AirPods Pro will likely have improved sound. Last week's Economic Daily News report also claimed that the AirPods Pro will feature multiple listening modes, suggesting they could have the same Transparency feature as the new Beats Solo Pro, which turns on the external microphones so the wearer can hear outside noise without pausing music playback.\nUnsurprisingly, higher-end AirPods would likely have a higher price tag than the current AirPods. Economic Daily News estimates pricing may start at around $259, which would be $100 more than the current AirPods with a wired charging case. However, supply chain reports are usually guessing about pricing.\nApple typically unveils redesigned products during its keynotes, but an October event is looking unlikely this year, so possibilities include Apple announcing the AirPods Pro with a press release, hosting an unprecedented November event, or waiting to unveil them at its typical March event next year.",
