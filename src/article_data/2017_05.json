        "title": "In 2016, Apple was the largest single taxpayer in the United States, paying $15.8 Billion at an effective rate of 25.8%.",
        "body": "If President Donald Trump and the GOP leadership can ever get it together to attack tax reform, shareholders of America's biggest companies would be able to hold onto tens of billions more per year in profits. And they would gain the opportunity to repatriate far more.\nAmerican companies suffer one of the world\u2019s highest federal tax rates at 35%. No surprise then that they\u2019ve moved profitable operations overseas, to lower-tax domains like Ireland, where the corporate rate is just 15%. U.S. companies have stashed an estimated $2 trillion in cash overseas. They can't bring it back home without Uncle Sam taking a piece.\nAnd they way companies see it, they already pay too much. Last year corporate income taxes contributed $444 billion to the U.S. Treasury. That\u2019s a fifth of the $2.2 trillion in total federal tax receipts \u2014 and more than double the federal take from businesses in the trough of the recession in 2009.\nWho would benefit the most from corporate tax reform? The biggest taxpayers of course. With the help of FactSet Research Systems, FORBES statistics editor Andrea Murphy took a look at the tax situations of America\u2019s biggest corporations \u2014 those 30 outfits with annual revenues greater than $80 billion. All told, in the past 12 months those companies have recorded income tax expenses totaling $117 billion \u2014 representing an average effective tax rate of 26.7%. (See all the data by clicking through the gallery.)\nThe biggest taxpayer was the most profitable: Apple, which reserved $15.8 billion for income taxes on $59 billion in operating income. Apple reports its effective tax rate as 25.8%, which is quite a bit lower than the statutory 35% rate. The iPhone giant (like many tech companies with a lot of intellectual property) has become famous over the years for deploying legions of accountants to devise offshore tax avoidance mechanisms with names like \u201cdouble Irish with a Dutch sandwich.\u201d Why book profits in the U.S. if you don\u2019t have to? Unfortunately for Apple, its pot of Irish gold appears to have evaporated. Last year the European Commission presented Apple with a $13 billion tax bill, payable to Dublin, on the grounds that Apple's tax structure had benefited from \"state aid,\" a no-no. CEO Tim Cook has called it \"total political crap.\"\nMicrosoft in the year ended June 2016 had $20.1 billion in foreign income and a domestic loss of $300 million. Microsoft\u2019s income tax expense was $3.3 billion, for an effective rate of 16.5%. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, posted a $4.7 billion tax expense, or 19%. Such \u201cavoision\u201d will continue as long as foreign income is subject to lower rates than domestic.\nThe U.S. continues to employ a so-called worldwide tax system. That means that earnings made overseas are only taxed when they come back to the U.S. Other nations use a territorial system, which does not tax overseas earnings of companies headquartered there. Candidate Trump proposed a one-time 10% levy on repatriated capital and adoption of the territorial system. Socialist Bernie Sanders, in contrast, favors requiring U.S.-based companies to pay higher U.S. tax rates on all the income they make worldwide, wherever earned.\nAmong the 30 megacorps, there were three companies that didn\u2019t record any new income tax expense in 2016. General Electric earned $10 billion last year, but recorded a tax benefit of $400 million for a 12-month tax rate of -4.5%. Now before you get outraged, keep in mind that the income statement tax expense is just an accounting creation. Forbes contributor Peter Reilly explains that our convoluted tax laws enable industrial companies like G.E. to depreciate equipment for tax-deduction purposes more quickly than they can for book purposes. So cash paid for taxes can regularly be less or more than amounts recorded on the income statement as a tax expense. Defending G.E. tax status against attacks from Bernie Sanders last year, CEO Jeff Immelt, wrote, \"We pay billions in taxes, including federal, state and local taxes.\"\nExxonMobil, because of the collapse in oil prices, had an odd income statement in 2016, with EBIT of $4.2 billion, net income of $7.8 billion, and a $406 million income tax benefit. That would imply that Exxon paid no taxes in 2016. But again, it depends on how you look at it. ExxonMobil\u2019s cashflow statement shows $4.2 billion in cash income taxes paid. The company says that in the decade to 2015 it made $82 billion in net income and paid out $110 billion in U.S. taxes.\nPresident Trump has promised tax reform. The trouble is, after the GOP\u2019s failure to repeal Obamacare, tackling taxes looks to have been pushed back to fall, at the earliest. Even if Trump joins with House leaders Paul Ryan, Kevin Brady and others to push for their vision a once-in-a-generation tax code overhaul, there's a risk their efforts could stall out. There's talk of bundling tax reform together with a grand overhaul of the funding mechanism for Social Security (and even doing away with FICA payroll deductions). It would be excruciating for tax reforms to be held hostage to a national debate over the future of how to fund Social Security. That would make the Obamacare repeal misadventure look like nothing more than a warm up.\nSee the whole list of tax bills for America's 30 biggest companies here.\nSave",

        "body": "I Got Rejected by Apple Music\u2026 So I Redesigned It Jason Yuan \u00b7 Follow Published in Startup Grind \u00b7 \u00b7 May 9, 2017 12 min read -- 464 Listen Share\nI\u2019d like to preface this case study by stating that my intentions behind redesigning Apple Music were in no way driven by indignation or spite.\nEarlier this year I applied and interviewed for a graphic design internship at Apple Music (an opportunity of a lifetime), and was turned down with a very kind letter stating that although they liked my work, they wanted to see more growth and training.\nAt first, I was frustrated \u2014 Northwestern University doesn\u2019t offer any sort of undergraduate graphic design program, so whatever growth they were looking for would have to be self taught\u2026\n\u2026but as soon as I came to this realization, I became inspired to embark on what became a a three-month long journey to the holy grail \u2014 the iOS app that Apple Music deserves.\nFor me, this was an opportunity to really dig my teeth into UX research and design, an excuse to spend way too much time on Sketch and Principle, a reason to bore everyone around me with my notebook of crudely drawn wireframes \ud83d\ude02\u2026\nWhat you\u2019ll find below is a case study offering potential solutions to address some of Apple Music\u2019s problems, as well as ideas for future development. My process was guided by qualitative user research, Apple\u2019s official Design Principles, and my own designer intuition.\nIntroduction\nAs a designer with a background in music composition and performance, I have always been passionate about experiences that marry music and technology. Through design, I hope to one day make the experience of music more accessible and enjoyable.\nHowever, Apple Music has always frustrated me. What was meant to be the service to convert everyone in the world to streaming is going through puberty \u2014 a phrase which here means steadily maturing yet unattractive compared to the adults in the game (aka Spotify).\nTo better understand Apple Music, I took a trip down memory lane and revisited its inception. Plagued with a notoriously confusing interface and a half-baked visual identity, Apple Music\u2019s first identity was the culprit of many headaches.",

        "title": "AirPods Have The Highest Customer Satisfaction of Any New Product From Apple",
        "body": "Ben Bajarin, writing for Techpinions:\nWe used every available resource to track down as many AirPod owners as we could. In the end, we found 942 people willing to take our study and share their thoughts on Apple\u2019s latest product.\nThe big story is customer satisfaction with AirPods is extremely high. 98% of AirPod owners said they were very satisfied or satisfied. Remarkably, 82% said they were very satisfied. The overall customer satisfaction level of 98% sets the record for the highest level of satisfaction for a new product from Apple. When the iPhone came out in 2007, it held a 92% customer satisfaction level, iPad in 2010 had 92%, and Apple Watch in 2015 had 97%.\nWhile the overall satisfaction number is remarkable, a second question we asked of these owners stood out even more. We used a standard benchmark question called a Net Promoter Score, which ranks a consumer\u2019s willingness to recommend the product to others. This ranking is on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 being extremely likely to recommend and 0 being not likely at all to recommend. It was this number that surprised me. Apple\u2019s Net Promoter Score for AirPods came back as 75. To put that into context, the iPhone\u2019s NPS number is 72. Product and NPS specialists will tell you anything above 50 is excellent and anything above 70 is world class. According to Survey Monkey\u2019s Global Benchmark of over 105,000 organizations who have tested their NPS, the average is an NPS of 39.",

        "title": "Modern \u201cHackintoshes\u201d show that Apple should probably just build a Mac tower",
        "body": "Apple is working on new desktop Macs, including a ground-up redesign of the tiny-but-controversial 2013 Mac Pro. We\u2019re also due for some new iMacs, which Apple says will include some features that will make less-demanding pro users happy.\nBut we don\u2019t know when they\u2019re coming, and the Mac Pro in particular is going to take at least a year to get here. Apple\u2019s reassurances are nice, but it\u2019s a small comfort to anyone who wants high-end processing power in a Mac right now. Apple hasn\u2019t put out a new desktop since it refreshed the iMacs in October of 2015, and the older, slower components in these computers keeps Apple out of new high-end fields like VR.\nThis is a problem for people who prefer or need macOS, since Apple\u2019s operating system is only really designed to work on Apple\u2019s hardware. But for the truly adventurous and desperate, there\u2019s another place to turn: fake Macs built with standard PC components, popularly known as \u201cHackintoshes.\u201d They've been around for a long time, but the state of Apple's desktop lineup is making them feel newly relevant these days. So we spoke with people who currently rely on Hackintoshes to see how the computers are being used\u2014and what they'd like to see from Apple.\nAdvertisement\nA brief history of the Hackintosh\nBack in 2005, Apple did the unthinkable: it announced that it would be abandoning IBM\u2019s PowerPC CPUs for its Macs. Starting in 2006, all Macs would be powered by the same Intel CPUs included in regular old PCs.\nThe Intel transition removed the single highest barrier to running Mac software on regular PCs: the hardware platform would now be much more similar than dissimilar. And amid the initial rending of garments from longtime Apple fans about the move from \u201cexotic,\u201d \u201cspecial\u201d PowerPC hardware to Intel hardware (it all seems very melodramatic in retrospect, frankly), there was already speculation about running Mac OS X on regular PCs. Hell, Apple\u2019s first developer hardware for Intel Macs was just a Pentium 4 in a Power Mac case.\nFurther Reading Picking up the pieces: John Siracusa mourns the Power PC\nOnce the Intel hardware actually started launching, \u201cOSx86\u201d projects began to crop up in earnest. Early efforts were pretty buggy and nasty; few GPUs were actually supported, it was almost never possible to apply system updates without breaking everything because you had to rely on custom OS kernels, and you had to hack around the fact that most PCs were still using BIOS firmware instead of the Mac\u2019s newer UEFI.\nThat has all changed now. Thanks to more modern PCs, a wider install base for Intel Macs, and dedicated enthusiast communities and forums like TonyMacx86, it\u2019s not too hard for anyone comfortable with PC building to assemble a Hackintosh using off-the-shelf parts. Community-developed apps and tools streamline the process of creating install media and setting up drivers, and while you\u2019re probably going to have to do a little bit of Terminal work getting everything to function perfectly, most major setup problems are easy enough to overcome for anyone who has been building and maintaining their own PCs for a while.\nAdvertisement\nTechnically against the rules, but Apple doesn\u2019t seem bothered\nAt this point I should mention this article is in no way intended to be an install guide or an endorsement of Hackintoshing. Today, as has always been the case, installing macOS on non-Apple hardware is a violation of Apple\u2019s licensing agreement. And in fact, I would even dissuade more technically inclined users from building Hackintoshes at all (for reasons we\u2019ll get into a bit later).\nThat said, Apple has done surprisingly little to shut down the Hackintosh community. When companies attempt to commercialize PCs running Mac software, as a long-gone company called Psystar briefly did back in 2008, Apple shuts them down swiftly and decisively. But macOS itself doesn't do more than a surface-level check for genuine Apple hardware\u2014the underlying hardware needs to be close-ish, and special bootloaders spoof things like the model, firmware information, and serial number. These OSx86 enthusiast communities have existed for years without so much as a cease-and-desist. Contrast this with Apple\u2019s much more stringent approach to iOS jailbreaking: the company releases new updates to disable old jailbreaks pretty quickly, at least in part because these jailbreaks rely exclusively on serious security flaws to work in the first place.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that Apple invites people to build Hackintoshes. It\u2019s more likely that the Hackintosh community has such a small effect on sales of actual Macs that it wouldn\u2019t be worth the time and effort it would take to develop and maintain new hardware checks as quickly as the Hackintosh community could work around them. Poor-to-nonexistent driver support and power management mean that laptops make terrible Hackintoshes, and laptops account for 80 percent of all Mac shipments. They just don't threaten Apple\u2019s business all that much (though I do think catering to these users with real Macs that met their needs could be good for the company's bottom line).",

        "body": "Apple has today been granted patents for two headline features expected from the iPhone 8: an edge-to-edge display, and a Touch ID button embedded into the screen.\nThe edge-to-edge display patent has the rather mundane heading \u2018Reducing the border area of a device.\u2019 It describes how a mostly-flat display can have a curved border area allowing it to wrap around the sides of the device \u2026\nThis relates to methods and systems for reducing the border areas of an electronic device so as to maximize the display/interactive touch areas of the device. In particular, a flexible substrate can be used to fabricate the display panel and/or the touch sensor panel (referred to collectively herein as a \u201ccircuit panel\u201d) of a mobile electronic device so that the edges of the display panel and/or the touch sensor panel can be bent. Bending the edges can reduce the width (or length) of the panel, which in turn can allow the overall device to be narrower without reducing the display/touch-active area of the device.\nThe embedded Touch ID patent is one of many submitted by Apple, describing different approaches it could take. This one re-uses language from a separate patent granted back in February, describing the benefits of allowing a user to authenticate without having to remove their finger from the screen.\nWhere a fingerprint sensor is integrated into an electronic device or host device, for example, as noted above, it may be desirable to more quickly perform authentication, particularly while performing another task or an application on the electronic device. In other words, in some instances it may be undesirable to have a user perform an authentication in a separate authentication step, for example switching between tasks to perform the authentication.\nAs is usual with Apple\u2019s patents, the drawings are generic in nature rather than illustrating any specific device type.\nThe patents were granted on the same day that new renders appeared, based on CAD drawings claimed to be of the iPhone 8.\nVia Patently Apple",

        "title": "Apple's Siri To Get Smarter As $200 Million Acquisition Of 'Dark Data' AI Specialist Lattice Data Pushes Through",
        "body": "Apple is expected to make its voice assistant Siri a lot smarter in the foreseeable future, as evidenced by its recent acquisition of AI company Lattice Data.\nThe Cupertino brand reportedly forked over $200 million to close the deal.\nApple Beefs Up AI Efforts\nAccording to TechCrunch, an unnamed source told it that Apple has already completed the acquisition a couple of weeks earlier. The agreement also seems to be partly a hire, as approximately 20 engineers have come aboard Apple's workforce.\nThe company didn't exactly confirm the development, but to no one's surprise, it did give out its usual comment. As a refresher, here's what it says when it's asked about such matters:\n\"Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.\"\nIn other words, that's more or less a confirmation in Apple parlance.\nWhat Is Lattice Data?\nLattice Data is a firm that focuses on AI and machine learning technology and specializes in \"dark data,\" which are essentially unstructured info such as text and images. It intends to make such data structured, allowing traditional tools to analyze them.\nConsidering that Apple didn't make an official announcement of the acquisition, it shouldn't come as a surprise that it didn't lay out its plans. Still, it's safe to expect that it aims to use the AI startup's resources to improve Siri.\nInterestingly enough, the aforementioned source also said that Lattice Data had been going around and \"talking to other tech companies about enhancing their AI assistants\" before inking the deal with Apple, including Amazon and Samsung.\nSiri Improvements Coming Soon\nTaking into account what Lattice Data is set out to do, Apple could be planning on giving Siri the capability of handling user commands better. Put differently, the voice assistant could make more sense out of dark data.\nMore than that, Apple is rumored to launch a Siri-powered smart speaker soon, and it could be making this move to compete with the likes of Google Home or Echo and its expanding lineup.\nLong Story Short\nApple is taking steps to up its AI game with the $200 million deal with Lattice Data, proving its determination to put Siri at the top of the competition.\nTo be clear, iOS or macOS users probably won't see changes just yet, but they can expect to see significant improvements in the long run, particularly getting better results and a better experience out of Siri when it learns how to make dark data usable.\nIt's also worth mentioning that the Cupertino brand is no stranger when it comes to tapping companies or experts here and there to boost its AI efforts, including but not limited to Carnegie Mellon University professor Ruslan Salakhutdinov and Tuplejump.\nNow that everything's said and done, what do you think of the possible improvements making their way to Siri?

        "title": "Apple's payment service Apple Pay is growing \u2013 the company saw a 450% rise in transactions over the last year.",
        "body": "Missed the GamesBeat Summit excitement? Don't worry! Tune in now to catch all of the live and virtual sessions here.\nApple\u2019s mobile payments wallet is growing quickly.\nThe number of Apple Pay transactions in the latest quarter rose 450% from the same period a year ago, CEO Tim Cook said on Tuesday during a conference call with analysts about his company\u2019s quarterly results.\nThe likely reason: Apple Pay expanded to a number of new international markets in 2016. It is now available in 15 countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, China, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and Russia.\nAs usual, Cook didn\u2019t reveal the number of Apple Pay users, revenue from Apple Pay, or the value of those transactions. In the past, Apple has said that one million new users sign up for Apple Pay each week.\nApple Pay debuted in 2014 as a way to let shoppers load their credit card and debit card information onto iPhones\u2019 \u201cmobile wallets.\u201d Customers can then use either their iPhone (or linked Apple Watch) to pay at retail stores equipped with point-of-sale registers supporting near-field communication (NFC) technology, which allows for payments between smartphones and registers. Apple Pay users simply place their phones or watches near the registers\u2019 sensors for payments without having to swipe a card.\nApple Pay competes both in the U.S. and internationally with Google\u2019s rival service Android Pay and Samsung Pay. Apple makes money by charging a small percentage on each transaction.\nCook also revealed on Tuesday that Apple Pay is accepted at 20 million locations worldwide, including 4.5 million in the U.S.\nNext, Apple may introduce an extension of its Apple Pay service that would let users send money to one another. The service would challenge PayPal\u2019s popular payments app, Venmo, according to Recode.\nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com. Copyright 2017",

        "title": "Report: Tim Cook testing wearable blood sugar tracker on Apple\u2019s campus, connected to Apple Watch",
        "body": "Earlier in April, news broke that Apple was developing an Apple Watch oriented solution to diagnose and manage diabetes, with a non-invasive sensor that continuously measures blood sugar levels. Today, CNBC is reporting that Tim Cook is actively wearing a glucose tracker prototype on his body around Apple\u2019s campus. Typical glucose monitors available today are invasive, bulky and cumbersome \u2014 a non-invasive optical solution would be a game changer for many people.\nThe report says that the wearable tracker is connected to the Apple Watch but the details are murky \u2026\nBased on CNBC\u2019s description, it sounds like the tracker Tim is wearing is a separate independent unit that communicates to the Watch over Bluetooth, rather than a feature integrated inside of the Apple Watch itself. The source says the glucose tracker was \u201con the Watch,\u201d which perhaps means it physically attaches to the watch chassis in some way to extend its capabilities.\nAlthough it would make sense for Apple to ultimately include the glucose tracker inside the Watch hardware, early prototypes may indeed be separate devices whilst Apple tests the algorithms and reliability in the real world. Behind closed doors, other teams would then work out how to incorporate the sensor into the Apple Watch chassis.\nThis is just speculation of course: there is also the possibility Apple sells the glucose tracker as an add-on accessory. Tim Cook has said in the past that certain features like blood monitoring require approval and regulation by the FDA. By creating a separate accessory, Apple will be able to iterate on product development on its primary Watch line unimpaired whilst sending off the ancillary device through the necessary regulatory procedures.\nCNBC also notes that Cook mentioned that he was using a continuous glucose monitor when he visited the University of Glasgow. Cook said the readouts from the glucose monitor helped him adjust his diet to keep his blood sugar in check. Again, it wasn\u2019t clear if this device was made by a third-party company or by Apple itself:\nTim Cook also talked about the device to a roomful of students in February at the University of Glasgow, where he received an honorary degree. He didn\u2019t say if it was a medical device from a company like Medtronic or Dexcom, or an Apple prototype. \u201cI\u2019ve been wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cI just took it off before coming on this trip.\u201d\nApple\u2019s research into diabetes treatment was also highlighted by BGR in recent days. That report indicated that Apple would manufacture smart bands that expand the Watch with additional functions (as well as looking stylish). This means the glucose monitor could become part of one of these smart bands, which would communicate with future Apple Watch hardware.\nAlthough there are not many rumors right now about a Series 3 Apple Watch, some supply-side reports have pointed to a fall revision for Apple\u2019s wearable line. It will apparently use a new type of touch sensor technology.",

Along with introducing new versions of iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS, there are rumors suggesting Apple will introduce new hardware.New MacBooks and MacBook Pro models are expected, and there's a chance Apple will also introduce a refreshed MacBook Air. Rumors suggest the notebooks will feature more powerful processors and perhaps some other internal upgrades, but no design changes will be included.Along with new MacBooks, Apple may also introduce two much-rumored products, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and the Siri speaker. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro is said to feature a bigger display in a body that's similar in size to the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro, made possible through much smaller bezels. Apple's Siri speaker is the company's answer to the popular Amazon Echo, and it is expected to feature Siri integration, superior sound quality, and perhaps a touch display.For the June 5 keynote event,will provide a live blog both here on MacRumors.com and on our MacRumorsLive Twitter account , along with detailed coverage of everything Apple announces during the week.Article Link: Apple Confirms June 5 WWDC Keynote Will Be Live Streamed",

        "body": "A new report from Economic Daily News, via Digitimes, indicates that the iPhone 8 will use a new optical fingerprint sensor technology to enable users to place their fingers directly on the OLED display and have the phone scan the print, as an elegant replacement for the existing Touch ID home button.\nThe screen ratio will change from 16:9 on iPhone 7 to 18.5:9 (corroborating many other sources) and \u2018invisible\u2019 Infrared sensors will unlock enhanced camera and augmented reality features. Apparently, TSMC discussed these upcoming flagship iPhone features at a Taipei symposium.\nThe iPhone 8 is expected to be a radical update in both functionality and appearance, with a stainless steel and glass chassis. The display will increase to 5.8-inches and yet the phone will not be much bigger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 as the front face will be nearly bezel-less and dominated by screen.\nThe fate of the fingerprint sensor has been disputed by rumors over the last few months. There have been rumors about a fingerprint sensor in the power button, a fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone and the idea of an integrated-display scanner.\nThis latest report from Economic Daily News suggests that the most elegant solution is what Apple is going with. With a virtual home button drawn on the display, users would simply place their fingers on the screen and the optical scanner would authenticate the fingerprint.\nThe details about the infrared sensor for AR and camera mirror previous reports from KGI. In the previous report, Ming-Chi Kuo indicated that the infrared depth-sensing would be used for facial recognition offering iPhone 8 users another way to unlock the device.\nThe sourcing of this latest report is promising. Digitimes is transcribing the Chinese language Economic Daily News paper who says that its information comes from TSMC sources who shared details about Apple\u2019s upcoming iPhone at a company conference. TSMC is manufacturing the Apple A11 chip and it is not implausible for them to have intimate access to the next-gen iPhone hardware. Whilst the provenance is by no means a definitive source of reliability, it is not that farfetched either.\nApple is set to debut the iPhone 8 in the fall, although the premium features will come at seemingly higher prices than current iPhone models.\nThe company is also rumored to be launching two \u20187s\u2019 phones in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes which will largely resemble the current-generation iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These two iterative new models will be priced at the usual levels and focus on internal component improvements.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more iPhone news!",

There are signs that Chrome may never appear on the Windows Store as Google will need to rework its browser to meet Microsoft\u2019s strict app requirements. Windows Store apps that browse the web need to use Microsoft\u2019s Edge engine, and the current Chrome desktop app uses Google\u2019s Blink rendering engine.

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nSome of Apple's problems with iPhone sales can be traced to more rapid leaks posted on news sites, CEO Tim Cook claimed during a quarterly results call on Tuesday.\n\"Earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones\" are having an impact, Cook said in response to an analyst question. The executive didn't go into further detail.\nProduct rumors have been a factor in Apple sales for years, particularly with devices updated in annual cycles like the iPhone and iPad. People shopping for a smartphone in July, for instance, might consider holding off if a significant iPhone update is predicted for September. Hints of a modest update can prompt people to wait even longer, or simply buy an Android phone.\nThe issue may be exacerbated this year because of the alleged scale of Apple's plans. The \"iPhone 8\" is expected to be a major redesign, with a 5.8-inch OLED screen, a virtual home button, wireless charging, and 3D facial recognition and/or iris scanning.\nAssociated rumors go back as far as 2015 and have only intensified in recent months as the company approaches a crucial summer deadline for mass production. Supposed schematics and manufacturing molds may even be offering a glimpse at the product's final design, such as its vertically-aligned dual-lens camera.",

        "title": "'iPhone 8' Production on Schedule for September Launch, October Sales",
        "body": "Apple will begin selling its new range of iPhones in October this year following a September unveiling, according to a report out on Monday. Previous rumors have claimed that Apple will struggle to meet its usual fall launch timeframe for its upcoming OLED iPhone, which is set to debut alongside two more typical LCD models, with several sources claiming the \"tenth anniversary\" phone faces a possible delay late into the fourth quarter because of production yield rate issues.\nJapanese site Mac Otakara earlier this year suggested the \"iPhone 8\" would launch \"very much\" behind the LCD models, while KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes Apple will debut the OLED iPhone in September, but the device will face \"severe supply shortages\" until as late as October-November, two months later than previous ramp-ups in August-September. Similar delayed production rumors have been circulated by analysts and media outlets in recent months.\nIn contrast, the Chinese-language Economic Daily News claimed on Monday that there will be no delay for the launch of the next-generation phones, signaling the usual ramp-up in the production of parts related to the iPhone beginning next month.\nUpstream to downstream suppliers in the iPhone supply chains, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), SLP (substrate-like PCB) makers Zhen Ding Technology and Kinsus Interconnect Technology, and battery supplier Simplo Technology, are ready to ramp up related iPhone parts starting June. TSMC will begin to fabricate the wafer starts needed for the production of A11 processors on June 10 and to deliver the chips in volume quantity in the second half of July, the report indicated.\nBoth Zhen Ding and Kinsus have reportedly managed to improve the yield rates of SLP products which will allow for volume production of the materials in June. Meanwhile, iPhone assemblers Foxconn, Winston, and Pegatron are said to be accelerating the recruitment and training of new workers in China in preparation of mass production of the new iPhone.\nApple has a major redesign planned for the \"iPhone 8\", with a glass body and edge-to-edge OLED display that may include an integrated Touch ID fingerprint sensor if the company can overcome the technical challenges involved. Other potential features include wireless charging, a vertically oriented rear dual-lens camera, and a front-facing camera with 3D sensing and facial recognition capabilities. The OLED iPhone is expected to be sold alongside upgraded (but standard) 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhones.\n(Via DigiTimes.)",

        "body": "In a new Q&A video from Wired, Blizzard vice president Jeff Kaplan responded to a list of user questions on Twitter, all centered around the company's popular first-person shooter Overwatch, which is currently available on PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4. Ahead of the game's release, the company said that any development on Mac was not in the works and that focus would be on the other platforms.\nNow, in response to a user asking if the game will ever be on Mac, Kaplan has said that Blizzard is \"open minded\" about bringing Overwatch to MacBooks and iMacs, although such development doesn't appear to be a priority.\nUser's question: Hi I was just wondering and I'm sure this question is kinda of annoying. Will Overwatch be coming to mac? Kaplan's answer: I will not say that it's definite...that we will never be on Mac. We are open minded to it, we just need the priorities of our development process to line up with the capabilities of the platform in order for it to become a reality.\nKaplan's response is a bit non-committal, neither confirming nor denying whether players will ever be able to purchase Overwatch for the Mac, but it is at least nice hearing that the team behind the game continues to consider all platform options moving forward. It remains unclear what specific Mac-related limitations might be preventing Blizzard from pushing forward in Mac development on Overwatch, but from Kaplan's comments it appears that the team wants to ensure the game's quality before it would publish it on Apple's computers.\nBlizzard has supported Apple devices for many of its previous games, including bringing Hearthstone to iOS and Mac, as well as launching Heroes of the Storm on Mac. Overwatch runs best with a consistent frame rate due to its fast-paced gameplay, particularly during competitive season games, but some lower-end PCs have been able to run the game with concessions in graphics and resolution.\nThe Mac-related question appears at 12:45 in Wired's new video.",

New versions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro are expected to be announced, and Apple is also considering updating the MacBook Air, its most affordable notebook.\nThe MacBook Pro, which was just updated in October with a slimmer design and a Touch Bar, will be refreshed with a faster Kaby Lake processor, an update from the Skylake processors in the current machines. It will look the same as the current model, adopting only internal updates.\nApple has been working on a custom-designed ARM chip that could handle low power features in the MacBook Pro, but the chip may not be ready for the June MacBook Pro refresh.\nApple's MacBook, last updated in April of 2016, will gain an updated processor, also likely to be in the Kaby Lake family.\nApple has not updated its MacBook Air since March of 2015 and has been phasing it out in favor of the MacBook and the MacBook Pro, both of which are now thinner than the \"Air\" model, but Bloomberg suggests Apple is thinking about refreshing it with an updated processor, which would mean the MacBook Air could stick around for at least another few years as a low-cost notebook option. Sales of the MacBook Air \"remain surprisingly strong\" due to its affordability.\nThe new notebooks are likely to be announced at Apple's June 5 keynote, which is set to kick off at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Rumors also suggest Apple could use the event to introduce both a new Siri speaker and the long-rumored 10.5-inch iPad Pro, which is said to feature slimmer bezels for a nearly edge-to-edge design.\nToday's report makes no mention of the iMac or Mac mini, two of Apple's desktop machines that have not been updated in some time. It has been more than 580 days since the iMac was last updated in October of 2015, and more than 940 days since the Mac mini was updated in October of 2014.\nApple has said it has updated iMacs in the works, but it is not clear when the machines will debut.",

        "body": "Just five days ahead of Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, where it is widely expected to announce new Macs, French website Consomac has discovered a new Russian-language regulatory filing, in the Eurasian Economic Commission database, that points towards at least five new models running macOS Sierra launching soon.\nThe five new Macs, identified only with the model numbers A1289, A1347, A1418, A1419, and A1481, are likely to be new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros alongside a new 12-inch MacBook, with the outside chance of a new upgraded MacBook Air also in the frame. At the same time, it's worth noting that these numbers differ from the AXX prefixes attributed to current MacBook models, so nothing is completely certain until Apple makes its announcements.\nAs well as spare parts for the Macs, the discovered numbers also include a possible new wireless keyboard (model A1843) and four numbers classified under iOS 10 (A1671, A1709, A1670, and A1701), pointing to the possible launch of a rumored new iPad Pro model.\nEurasian Economic Commission regulatory filings in English via Google Translate\nEarlier this week on Memorial Day, MacRumors reported that MacBook Pro orders placed on Monday on Apple's online store had estimated deliveries of between June 6-8 in the United States, suggesting Apple was in the process of restocking ahead of WWDC, when the new Macs are expected to be announced. The notebooks are expected to thought to be receiving internal improvements only, including an upgrade to Intel's faster Kaby Lake processors.\nApple last refreshed the MacBook Pro in October 2016, after the notebook went 527 days without being updated. In contrast, only 220 days will have passed if Apple launches new MacBook Pro models on June 5, which is below the average timeframe of 320 days between any two MacBook Pro generations.\nThe new notebooks are likely to be announced at Apple's June 5 WWDC keynote, which is set to kick off at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Rumors also suggest Apple could use the event to introduce a new Siri smart speaker.\nThe EEC filing, published today, satisfies Russia's requirement for companies to register all products containing encryption and/or cryptographic tools.",

        "title": "Nintendo developing \u2018The Legend of Zelda\u2019 game for iPhone",
        "body": "The Pok\u00e9mon Company\u2019s phenomenal success with Pok\u00e9mon Go certainly seems like the trigger that made Nintendo take the mobile market seriously. It launched Super Mario Run late last year, debuted Fire Emblem: Heroes in January, and has announced plans to bring other flagship franchises to iPhone later this year.\nToday, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Nintendo is developing a Legend of Zelda game for iPhone, jumping off the Nintendo Switch\u2019s success with Breath of the Wild.\nDetails about the company\u2019s plans come via the usual sources familiar with the matter.\nThe report says that Nintendo will release the new Zelda game after the iPhone version of Animal Crossing comes out. Animal Crossing was originally scheduled to launch before April but the company delayed the release.\nThe Wall Street Journal sources indicate Animal Crossing won\u2019t be available until the second half of 2017. It says the new instalment of The Legend of Zelda will come after that, but warns that the schedule is flexible. It is unknown if iPhone Zelda will be a full 3D RPG like the flagship console games, a port of one of the many 2D Zelda RPGs from Nintendo\u2019s handheld consoles, or something else entirely.\nNintendo is currently seeing strong sales of its new home console, the Nintendo Switch, with the system\u2019s launch propelled by incredible customer and critic response to \u2018The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\u2019 The Switch game retails for $60; pricing plans for the mobile version of Zelda remain unclear.\nWith Super Mario Run, Nintendo opted not to rely on the usual freemium monetization. Instead, players run a few levels for free and then unlock the full game with a one-time $10 purchase. In contrast, Fire Emblem does rely on typical micro-transactions to buy in-game currency.\nThe same report claims the Pok\u00e9mon Company will follow-up on Pok\u00e9mon Go with a new card-based game for mobile in the future (exactly what\u2019s new here isn\u2019t obvious, given Pok\u00e9mon TCG Online has been out for some time now).",

        "title": "Google and Amazon killed their Apple Watch apps and it went unnoticed for weeks",
        "body": "A handful of apps are no longer supported on the Apple Watch, according to a report by Apple Insider. Major apps like Google Maps, Amazon, and eBay appear to have quietly abandoned the Apple Watch App Store, without giving a heads up or providing any explanation to users.\nAI reports that Google pulled support for its Maps app on watchOS a few weeks ago, while recent updates to the Amazon and eBay apps no longer reference support for the Apple Watch. A Google spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that it had removed its watchOS app, but intends to return to the platform. \u201cWe removed Apple Watch support from our latest iOS release, but expect to support it again in the future.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is the right solution for our customers.\u201d\nAmazon echoed the sentiment. \u201cThere are a number of reasons we don\u2019t think this is the right solution for our customers at this time,\u201d a spokesperson told The Verge. \u201cWe are always trying new things and look forward to experimenting with wearable solutions in the future.\u201d\nOther affected apps include Target (the main one, not its coupon app Cartwheel) and TripAdvisor. A TripAdvisor thread dating back to February questioned the changes, but users said they emailed technical support and received no response. When reached for comment, TripAdvisor, too, said it pulled its watchOS app until it believes a better wearable solution comes along.\n\u201cWe suspended our Apple Watch app in February 2017 as we work to develop a better experience for consumers using wearable tech,\u201d a TripAdvisor spokesperson said. \u201cWe believe in the Apple Watch as a platform and intend to continue to explore how wearables can help travelers throughout their planning and in destination experiences.\u201d\nThe lack of a direct response or explanation to users from these companies seem peculiar \u2014 AI speculates it\u2019s likely that users were simply not using the apps which is why the change went mostly unnoticed for weeks. This would theoretically explain why developers may have thought it was best to discontinue support. After all, shopping on apps like Target, eBay, and Amazon on your wrist is probably not ideal. For Google Maps users on the Apple Watch, however, it\u2019s back to Apple Maps for now. Maybe something will come out of watchOS 4?\nWe\u2019ve reached out to the above companies for comment and will update if we hear back.",

        "title": "Early Adopters Love Their Apple AirPods",
        "body": "As a serious world traveler, I always carry some sort of headset. Back in the day, it was earphones for the Sony Walkman; now it's Apple's AirPods.\nRecently, my firm Creative Strategies ran a follow up to the voice assistant research study we published last year(Opens in a new window). We again partnered with Experian(Opens in a new window) but added Apple's AirPods to the study since Siri integration is one of their key features. We used every available resource to track down as many AirPod owners as we could and found 942 people willing to share their thoughts on Apple's latest product.\nCustomer Satisfaction\nThe big story is high customer satisfaction; 98 percent of AirPod owners are very satisfied or satisfied, with 82 percent very satisfied. This sets the record for the highest level of satisfaction for a new product from Apple; the original iPhone and iPad each had a 92 percent satisfaction ratings when they arrived; Apple Watch in 2015 had 97 percent(Opens in a new window).\nWhile the overall satisfaction number is remarkable, a second question we asked of these owners stood out even more. We used a standard benchmark question called a Net Promoter Score, which ranks a consumer's willingness to recommend the product to others. This ranking is on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 being extremely likely to recommend and 0 being not likely at all to recommend.\nApple's Net Promoter Score for AirPods came back as 75. To put that into context, the iPhone's NPS number is 72. Product and NPS specialists will tell you anything above 50 is excellent and anything above 70 is world class. According to Survey Monkey's Global Benchmark of over 105,000 organizations that have tested their NPS, the average is an NPS of 39.\nThis incredibly high Net Promoter Score intrigued me for another reason. We know from profiling questions that most Apple AirPod owners fall into the early adopter category and early adopters don't usually give products high recommendations. The first few studies we did on Apple Watch had a lower NPS, as did the Amazon Echo and Google Home. AirPods broke the mold here, as even the harshest critics felt AirPods are ready for the mainstream.\nWe asked respondents to briefly explain their ranking and an analysis of the most frequently used words by respondents were: Fit, Magic, Sound Quality, Convenient, Love, Good Sound, and Battery Life.\nGeneral themes in the write-in section were also quite telling. Folks raved about the iPhone pairing process and many were surprised by how well they worked citing bad experiences with prior Bluetooth headphones. First timers were also impressed by how convenient and useful wireless headphones are, while others said they liked the AirPods even more than they thought they would.\nWhile there was some negativity in the write-in section, it was mostly around concerns or issues with fit or connectivity problems. But these were certainly an extreme minority.\nFeature Satisfaction\nWe also looked at customer satisfaction around certain features. The number that stood out most is comfort and secure fit. There was a great deal of debate about AirPods when they first came out that not having a cable means it will make them not stay in or people will lose them easily if they fall out. We can now dispel that myth as Apple has designed a product that fits most people's ears and, more importantly, fits securely and does not fall out for the vast majority of owners. Only 4.6 percent of AirPod owners who participated in the study said they were dissatisfied with the fit and ability to fit snugly.\nConsumer Sentiment for AirPods\nLastly, for the AirPods part of our study, we added some general sentiment questions to see what kinds of feelings or emotions consumers agreed/did not agree with regarding AirPods. A couple of standout answers are worth mentioning.\n84 percent of respondents strongly or somewhat agree that using just one AirPod at a time makes sense in certain situations . This is not necessarily a new behavior if we reflect back to the Bluetooth earpiece days for making calls, but certainly an additional value proposition to Bluetooth headphones as a category.\n88.97 percent of respondents strongly or somewhat agree AirPods consistently pair to their iPhone as soon as they put one in their ear . While Bluetooth reliability has come a long way, we know many Bluetooth headsets on the market do struggle with pairing consistently quite often. This data point suggests instant pairing reliability of AirPods is quite high.\n82.5 percent of consumers would like more control over their content by tapping the AirPods to do things like turn volume up or down or skip to next song . Right now that can be done manually or by asking Siri to turn the volume up or down or skip to next song, but it appears some way to have more control of media by touching or tapping the AirPods themselves is desirable.\n82 percent of respondents strongly or somewhat agree AirPods are their favorite Apple products launched in recent memory . What makes this question interesting is the fact that, while our respondents mainly lean to early tech adoption, we do not have a massive group of hardcore Apple fanatics. Knowing that makes this question all the more interesting. Overall, our respondents feel Apple has released one of the best products in a long time.\n62 percent of respondents strongly or somewhat agree AirPods are causing them to consume more audio content (music, books, podcast, etc) than before they owned AirPods. This is fascinating as it could indicate AirPods becoming a catalyst for more of Apple or third-party services.\nLastly, we wanted to see how much our participants in the study still defaulted to old habits or didn't trust AirPods enough to completely go wireless and fully ditch their wired headphones. To our surprise, 64 percent of consumers somewhat disagree or strongly disagree they keep wired headphones handy just in case AirPods don't work.\nSamsung Gear IconX Review Samsung Gear IconX Review",

        "title": "TSMC reportedly starts production of Apple A11 chip for iPhone 8 with 10nm process",
        "body": "According to a new report from Digitimes, TSMC has officially begun production of the Apple A11 SoC, set to feature in the iPhone 8 later this year. The foundry apparently wanted to begin mass production in April but faced issues with yields. TSMC will be the sole supplier of A11 chips for the upcoming iPhone refresh.\nThe A11 chip is also expected to be included in the iPhone 7s spec bump phones, which will seemingly use the same chassis design as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, although this is not universally supported by the rumors.\nAs usual, Apple has designed the A11 layout to its proprietary custom specification and then relies on a third party to fabricate the components. Most benchmarks show Apple\u2019s custom CPU designs as the best in the smartphone industry as far as performance is concerned.\nDigitimes acknowledges that there were some production issues but notes these issues have now been resolved.\nTSMC has begun 10nm chip production for Apple\u2019s next-generation iPhone 8 series, the sources said. Production was once affected by issues involving stacking components in the backend integrated fan-out packaging process, but they have already been solved, the sources said.\nOther reports have indicated that the iPhone 8 will pack in 3 GB RAM, which is the same as the iPhone 7 Plus. Yield issues for the iPhone 8 have been widely reported in recent weeks. On Tuesday, KGI claimed that mass production of the iPhone 8 may not start until October or November. A separate report has also suggested that the device may not go on sale until October.\nVariants of the Apple A11 chip may also appear in Apple\u2019s upcoming iPad revisions. The company is expected to debut a new 12.9 inch iPad Pro and a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro at some point in the year. It is also possible that if these iPads launch sooner rather than later, that they use an \u2018A10X\u2019 chip or similar instead.\n(Header image is a concept drawing based on recent CAD schematics for iPhone 8)",

        "title": "Today in Apple history: Bill Gates predicts doom for Apple\u2019s biggest product",
        "body": "May 12, 2005: Longtime Apple frenemy Bill Gates tells a German newspaper that Apple may have hit it big with the iPod, but that its success isn\u2019t going to last forever.\nThe reason? Mobile phones are going to steal the iPod\u2019s market share. The good news for Gates is that he was right on the money. The bad news for Microsoft is that Apple cannibalized itself by making the iPhone. And Apple\u2019s smartphone became even more successful than the iPod.\nBill Gates: Apple can\u2019t sustain iPod success\n\u201cAs good as Apple may be, I don\u2019t believe the success of the iPod is sustainable in the long run,\u201d Gates told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. \u201cYou can make parallels with computers: Apple was very strong in this field before, with its Macintosh and its graphics user interface \u2014 like the iPod today \u2014 and then lost its position.\u201d\nGates went on to predict how things would play out. Cellphones, capable of doing much of what an iPod could do, would destroy the market for MP3 players, he said.\nAt the time, the Apple press viewed Gates\u2019 dismissive comments about the iPod as sour grapes from a man who \u2014 having stepped down as Microsoft CEO in 2000 \u2014 was no longer relevant in the tech world in the way Steve Jobs was.\nSony sold 340 million Walkmans over 25 years, pundits noted. Since Cupertino had sold just 15 million iPods at the time, most observers remained confident that Apple\u2019s portable music player would enjoy a long, successful future. And it did: Apple sold some version of the transformative music gadget for more than two decades, only pulling the plug on the iPod on May 10, 2022.\n(For more on the iPod\u2019s revolutionary role within 21st century culture, read Cult of Mac\u2019s special report: An illustrated history of the iPod and its massive impact.)\nCellphones are the new MP3 players\nToday, however, we know that Jobs agreed with Gates. The year before, at a time when sales of the iPod made up approximately 45% of Apple\u2019s revenue, he struck a deal with Motorola to produce a cellphone that could play songs from iTunes.\nThat phone wound up becoming the immensely disappointing Rokr E1, the grandfather of the iPhone and the first Apple-sanctioned cellphone to run iTunes. It was a bust, but it pushed Apple to enter the smartphone market \u2014 which it did two years later with the iPhone.\nHowever, despite Gates\u2019 prophetic words, Microsoft didn\u2019t take the iPhone too seriously, either. Watching this classic Steve Ballmer clip makes clear how badly Microsoft misjudged Apple\u2019s phone:\nYeah. Who would ever want a smartphone without a physical keyboard?",
