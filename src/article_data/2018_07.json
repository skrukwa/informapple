        "title": "Apple Music Just Surpassed Spotify's U.S. Subscriber Count",
        "body": "Apple Music Just Surpassed Spotify\u2019s U.S. Subscriber Count\nSave Save\nApple Music has now surpassed Spotify\u2019s US-based subscriber tally \u2014 and the lead is likely to widen by Christmas.\nApple Music has more paying subscribers in the United States than Spotify, according to confidential details shared with Digital Music News this morning.\nThe source, a US-based, major distributor, shared a report detailing the subscriber tallies of Spotify and several Spotify alternatives, including Apple Music, Tidal, and Sirius XM. That report now ranks Apple Music as first in the United States, at least among primarily on-demand music streaming services (Sirius XM Satellite Radio, which operates in North America exclusively, has more than 33 million subscribers).\nBoth Apple Music and Spotify have more than 20 million subscribers in America, with Apple now a hair ahead. The source requested that we withhold exact subscriber numbers beyond mentioning \u201920 million plus,\u2019 to protect confidentiality.\nThe data for 2018 also shows that Apple is experiencing a far stronger rate-of-growth in the United States, suggesting a wider lead over the coming months. Trial users were not part of the comparison.\nThe results aren\u2019t entirely surprising. Back in February, the Wall Street Journal noted that Apple\u2019s US-based subscriber growth rate was 5% in the U.S., compared to Spotify\u2019s 2%. Using that data, the Journal predicted that Apple Music was \u2018on the verge\u2019 of surpassing Spotify.\n+ Spotify\u2019s Financial Filing Makes You Wonder What People Are Really Paying for Subscriptions\nData on the average price paid per subscriber was not available, though we suspect that Apple is trumping Spotify in this category, as well.\nSpotify\u2019s freemium approach also includes substantial cut-rate plans, particularly for students, while Apple\u2019s discounts appear more limited.\nOverall, Apple Music now has more than 45 million subscribers globally, with an additional 5-10 million estimated free trial users. Apple\u2019s free trials typically last three months, with some exceptions (for example, in UAE). Spotify boasts more than 70 million paying subscribers worldwide, with roughly 160 million overall users.\n+ Apple Music Is Crushing Spotify In User Engagement \u2014 And the Latest Drake Numbers Prove It\nThat sounds like a serious advantage for Spotify, though a recent head-to-head battle involving Drake\u2019s latest album, Scorpion, revealed some surprising differences. Overall, Apple Music scored 170 million streams of album tracks during the first week, while Spotify amassed an estimated 130 million.\nThe disparity strongly suggests that Apple is achieving far better user engagement, especially given Spotify\u2019s extreme promotional push for the release. It also raises questions of just how \u2018active\u2019 Spotify\u2019s 160 million active users are.",

        "title": "Spotify has 83M paying subscribers compared to Apple Music's 40M",
        "body": "Spotify has announced that its paid subscribers rose 10% during Q2 to hit 83M. This is 8M up from the 75M it had at the beginning of the year \u2026\nReuters notes that this was slightly higher than the 82M estimated by analysts. Free subscribers on the ad-funded tier mean that its total subscriber base has now reached 180M.\nHowever, while the headline figure suggests that Spotify is doing well, a lot of those paid subscribers have been achieved through promotions, such as family and student deals \u2013 and a bundle with Hulu. Average revenue per user fell 12% to $5.72, and the company says that it sees no immediate prospect of any change there.\nThe big challenge for streaming music companies is that almost all the revenue goes straight to record labels and rights owners, offering razor-slim margins. Add in the other costs of running the business and Spotify continues to make a loss. Indeed, its losses widened to $460M, up from $220M a year ago.\nThe company says that it is prioritizing subscriber growth over profit, a strategy it believes will boost the value of the business in the long-term. But right now, it\u2019s hard to see how it can ever become a significantly profitable company.\nTo make matters tougher for Spotify, it is competing with a business which doesn\u2019t need to make a profit: Apple Music. Apple can afford to treat its streaming music service as a way to sell HomePods and to embed customers ever deeper into its ecosystem.\nWhile Spotify may still be well ahead in terms of global paid subscribers, it was recently reported that Apple Music is now ahead in the US.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s new 2018 MacBook Pros: Core i9, DDR4, updated keyboards, and more",
        "body": "Apple\nApple\nApple\nApple\nApple\nApple\nToday, Apple begins shipping the new 2018 refresh of the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro. The new machines are not major redesigns, but they offer configurations with 8th-generation Intel processors and more cores than before\u2014a maximum of six cores on the 15-inch model (compared to four in last year's models) and four in the 13-inch model (compared to two). That means faster performance for many use cases. Maximum SSD capacity is also doubled, and the MacBook Pro line offers DDR4 RAM for the first time.\nThe laptops also borrow some features from the iMac Pro and the iPad Pro\u2014the T2 chip and True Tone, respectively\u2014and feature a revised butterfly keyboard, the third generation of the design Apple introduced in 2016 (the revision is a little more significant this time around). Apart from those tweaks to the keyboard, the basic design of the MacBook Pro is unchanged.\nThe specs, though, get a noteworthy bump.\nInternals and specifications\nThe top configuration of the 15-inch model includes an 8th-generation, six-core Intel Core i9 CPU clocked at 2.9GHz. Six-core Intel Core i7 processors are also options. The 2017 iteration of the MacBook Pro featured DDR3 memory with a maximum configuration of 16GB. This time, it's DDR4, and the maximum is 32. The faster memory uses more energy, so a bigger battery is now included\u2014but Apple's battery life estimate remains the same as last year's. The GPU in the top standard configuration is listed as an AMD Radeon Pro 560X.\nNote: We originally reported that the top GPU available for this machine was the AMD Radeon Pro 555X, as that was what slides Apple showed us indicated, but now that the machines have launched in Apple's stores, we've learned that it's the 560X, so we've updated it here.\nThe 13-inch model has different specs, of course. It still only offers integrated Intel graphics, for one thing\u2014Intel Iris Plus 655, this time with 128MB of eDRAM. But the maximum number of cores is again doubled\u2014in this case to four\u2014in 8th-generation Intel Core i5 or Core i7 CPUs, which run at up to 2.7GHz. Maximum SSD capacity is also doubled; it's now 2TB. The maximum memory is still 16GB. Apple claims the 13-inch model is up to twice as fast as its predecessor, though it will of course depend on the application.\nThe new MacBook Pros will ship with macOS High Sierra, but they can be upgraded to Mojave, Apple's newest announced operating system, when it launches later this year.\nThe 2016 MacBook Pro brought the Apple T1, an Apple-made chip that is almost an integrated mini iOS device that controls the Touch Bar and Apple Pay while also acting as a bridge for certain hardware. The T2 chip added in the iMac Pro last December greatly expanded on this, becoming an all-purpose system-management controller and offering a bunch of new security features. Both new MacBook Pros now include the T2.\nAdvertisement\nWe described the T2 in some detail in our iMac Pro review . The T2 in the MacBook Pro does everything that the iMac Pro's does, plus some new things. It facilitates a secure boot feature, encrypts files in storage on the fly, manages the SSDs, and enables Hey Siri, whereby you can simply call up Siri with your voice. Most users wouldn't really know about the T2 chip unless you told them, but it has noteworthy security ramifications, and it speaks to Apple's focus on end-to-end integration and its aggressive efforts to free itself from dependence on outside chip providers.\nThe iPad Pro introduced a feature called True Tone, which also made it to the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X. When enabled, it adjusts the white balance of the screen based on ambient light to maintain eye comfort and achieve what Apple has described as a more natural look. It doesn't actually make the screen more objectively accurate, but it's a popular feature, especially for long sessions of use in varying lighting conditions.\nAll of the new 2018 Touch Bar MacBook Pros support True Tone now, both on the main display and the Touch Bar.\nThe keyboard\nThe butterfly keyboard design Apple introduced in 2016 has been divisive. Some people really like it, claiming it has fast travel and a sturdy, responsive feel to it. Others feel it's uncomfortable to type on. We haven't seen a keyboard this polarizing in a long time; it's a point of passionate disagreement even among Ars Technica reviews staff.\nFurther, some users experienced keyboard failures, particularly in the 2016 model. Small tweaks to the design in 2017 models reportedly reduced the failure rate. Apple claims the problem is not that widespread, but it nevertheless recently began offering service for the keyboard at no cost in a repair program. This newly revised keyboard is another iterative step in that design, although Apple hasn't made any claims about the new keyboard's comparative durability.\nThe new keyboard has the same dimensions and look as its two predecessors, but the keys feel just a little bit different. They're quieter, for one thing. They have a softer, less click-y feel that is a little closer to the pre-2016 models' chiclet keys. We found the new keyboard to be a little nicer to type on, but it's not a radical difference. It's unlikely to convert the detractors, but it's a welcome iteration for those who liked or didn't mind the previous butterfly keyboards.\nTwo new accessories: eGPU and leather sleeves\nApple is now offering leather sleeves for both MacBook Pro sizes, similar in styling to those we've already seen for the MacBook. They come in three colors: \"Saddle Brown,\" \"Midnight Blue,\" and black. Saddle brown is pictured in the images above.\nThere is also an Apple-sanctioned eGPU solution. Apple says it worked with Blackmagic Design (a company known for high-end hardware products for photographers, video editors, and others) to develop a different approach to eGPU enclosures. The new eGPU, which is also expected to go on sale today, integrates the GPU into the enclosure rather than offering one or more PCIe slots. It also supports Thunderbolt displays and provides 85W of power to the laptop for charging.\nThe included GPU is an 8GB Radeon Pro 580. It should deliver significantly faster video performance than the discrete GPU in the new 15-inch MacBook Pro, but it's not at the highest end of desktop GPU performance. The enclosure, which obviously includes the GPU, is priced at $699. Apple claims that this integrated solution provides easier setup for users who don't want to mess with installing their own cards and that it has a smaller footprint and runs quieter than many other enclosures.\nAdvertisement\nApple\u2019s target user\nA short time before announcing these new machines, Apple launched a marketing campaign on its website called Behind the Mac. The campaign included a promotional video about how legally blind photographer Bruce Hall uses Macs to do his work. In a closed briefing with members of the press, Apple presented several more professionals who came to showcase their work on the MacBook Pro, including scientists, video editors, musicians, software developers, and photographers.\nThe MacBook Pro is widely used by consumers, but Apple markets it as a professional machine. \"Professional\" means a lot of different things to different people, depending on, well, what their professions are. Showcases and campaigns like this make it clear that when Apple says \"Pro,\" it mainly means creative professionals like video and music producers, plus scientists and engineers.\nDevelopers are a heavy focus. Apple has claimed before that a significant majority of GitHub commits are made using Macs. When demonstrating the new MacBook Pro, the company offered a demo of five Xcode simulations running alongside virtual machines and Xcode builds\u2014similar to the one it showed at the iMac Pro press briefing in December of last year.\nShowcase participants talked up the power of the MacBook Pro a bit, but some of them just talked about their work. Here's the full list of professionals Apple presented as showcase-worthy users.\nApple\nApple\nApple\nApple\nApple\nApple\nApple\nApple\nApple\nAvailability\nThe new 13-inch and 15-inch Touch Bar MacBook Pro models will be available for order today, and a limited inventory of standard configuration units is also expected in Apple retail stores. Initial online orders of standard configurations are expected to ship within a few days.\nWhile Apple's focus is currently on Touch Bar-equipped models, it will continue to offer at least the 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar, with the intent to market it to education customers in particular. We don't know the status of the 15-inch without the Touch Bar at the time of this writing.\nThe 13-inch starts at $1,799 and the 15-inch starts at $2,399\u2014exactly the same starting prices as last year's models. We'll be giving the new 15-inch MacBook Pro the full Ars review treatment in the coming days.\nListing image by Apple",

But the company\u2019s silence on the mechanism\u2019s widespread mechanical issues, which Apple first acknowledged with a repair program last month, has left many scratching their heads and wondering if the new laptop\u2019s largely unchanged keyboard is susceptible to dust and crumb contamination under the hood.\nNow, iFixit says it\u2019s uncovered something that indicates that the new MacBook Pro keyboards use a silicone membrane underneath each individual key to keep dirt and other unsavory particles from finding their way under the keyboard and locking it up. The repair organization dismantled a new 15-inch MacBook Pro keyboard to discover the new mechanism.\nApple\u2019s new MacBook Pro keyboards use a silicone membrane to keep out dust\nIt bears a remarkable resemblance to an Apple patent that went public back in March. It described various methods for keyboard design that would prevent crumbs and dust from getting underneath the keys and causing mechanical issues. The methods describe using a \u201cguard structure extending from the key cap\u201d that would \u201cfunnel\u201d contaminants away from the sensitive portions of the keyboard. That guard structure could be separated from the base when in an undepressed position and that it would not make contact with the base even when depressed due to a gasket sitting in between.\nThe patent application goes on to say that the gasket could comprise of a layer of silicone that would act as a membrane. iFixit now says that\u2019s exactly what the new MacBook Pro keyboard contains, and that the sound of the keyboard is quieter as a side effect of the silicone membrane.",

        "body": "In an internal document distributed to Apple Authorized Service Providers, obtained by MacRumors from multiple reliable sources, Apple has confirmed that the third-generation keyboard on 2018 MacBook Pro models is equipped with a \"membrane\" to \"prevent debris from entering the butterfly mechanism.\"\nImage Credit: iFixit\nKeyboard and Keycaps\nThe keyboard has a membrane under the keycaps to prevent debris from entering the butterfly mechanism. The procedure for the space bar replacement has also changed from the previous model. Repair documentation and service videos will be available when keycap parts begin shipping.\nThe relevant excerpt from Canadian and European versions of Apple's internal 2018 MacBook Pro Service Readiness Guide:\nWhile the U.S. version of this Service Readiness Guide does not mention the membrane, it contains a link to a separate internal document titled \"Butterfly Mechanism Keycap Replacement MacBook Pro (2018)\" that does:\nCaution: The keyboard has a membrane under the keycaps to prevent debris from entering the butterfly mechanism. Be careful not to tear the membrane. A torn membrane will result in a top case replacement.\nIn its teardown of the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar last week, the repair experts at iFixit were first to discover the thin, silicone barrier underneath the keycaps, and theorized that it was to prevent dust indeed. Apple filed a patent for a contaminant-resistant MacBook keyboard back in 2016.\nPublicly, Apple has only confirmed that 2018 MacBook Pro models feature an \"improved third-generation keyboard for quieter typing,\" but many suspected that the silicon membrane was actually to prevent \"contaminant ingress,\" fancy speak for the crumbs from your sandwich that you ate at your desk for lunch.\nFollowing years of anecdotal complaints from customers, and a few class action lawsuits, Apple initiated a worldwide service program last month, offering free repairs of 2015-and-later MacBook and 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pro keyboards, which are equipped with low-profile butterfly switch mechanisms.\nWe've already reported about the service program in more detail, but the gist is that those particular MacBook and MacBook Pro models can experience issues with sticky, unresponsive, or inconsistently functioning keys when small particles like dust or crumbs get stuck underneath the shallower keycaps.\nApple confirmed to MacRumors that third-generation keyboards will not be offered as replacements under its service program for 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pro second-generation keyboard repairs, likely due to a tweaked top case design.\nWe've reached out to Apple for comment.",

We need to bring our products into this cloud-first collaborative era.\" Click to expand...\nAdobe will launch a \"full version\" of Photoshop for iPad in 2019, according to's Mark Gurman and Nico Grant. The report claims Adobe will preview the app at its annual MAX creative conference in October.Adobe's chief of Creative Cloud software Scott Belsky confirmed that the company is working on a new cross-platform version of Photoshop and other apps, but declined to specify the timing of their launches.Adobe already offers a range of companion apps for Photoshop on iPhone and iPad, including Photoshop Fix for basic retouching, Photoshop Express for basic photo editing and creating collages, Photoshop Sketch for drawing and painting, and Photoshop Mix for creating multilayered images.The full version is expected to offer a wider range of tools, enabling users to start a project on the desktop and continue editing on the iPad, or vice versa. The app is said to have a mobile-friendly interface, as part of an architecture overhaul that will extend to other Adobe apps, such as Illustrator.The app will presumably be named Photoshop CC for iPad, and will likely be a free download, but like the already-available Lightroom CC for iPad, a $9.99 per month Creative Cloud subscription will likely be required to access the full feature set and syncing with Photoshop on the desktop.Photoshop CC would compete with other photo editing apps on iPad, including Affinity Photo, Pixelmator, and Snapseed by Google.Article Link: Adobe to Launch Full Version of Photoshop for iPad, Expected in 2019",

        "title": "Apple pushing out performance fix for MacBook Pro 2018",
        "body": "Apple has sent me the following statement to address the recent controversy surrounding the 2018 MacBook Pro and how it manages power and performance:\n\"Following extensive performance testing under numerous workloads, we've identified that there is a missing digital key in the firmware that impacts the thermal management system and could drive clock speeds down under heavy thermal loads on the new MacBook Pro. A bug fix is included in today's macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 Supplemental Update and is recommended. We apologize to any customer who has experienced less than optimal performance on their new systems. Customers can expect the new 15-inch MacBook Pro to be up to 70% faster, and the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar to be up to 2X faster, as shown in the performance results on our website.\"\nThe controversy started with Dave Lee, Dave2D on YouTube, who experienced really bad, and it now turns out really buggy, performance on the new MacBook Pro 2018 with a specific Adobe Premiere workload.\nWhile Apple couldn't initially reproduce the results, the company spent the last few days working with him to try and figure out what was going wrong.\nThe fix, which Apple will be making available via Software Update around the time this video hits, and following up on with a push notification, won't just benefit people with those worst-case-scenario workloads but should help with all workloads on the Coffee Lake MacBook Pro.\nThat, despite Apple insisting its own benchmarks, run prior to release and touting up to 70% improvements in some tasks, weren't affected by the bug and are still accurate, likewise the workloads and results of the video, photography, music, science, and developer experts the company hosted and made available to media during the MacBook Pro launch.\nReal world tests\nMy own tests with my own workloads, which skews heavily towards video, showed about as much of a performance increase from the 2017 MacBook Pro as the 2017 MacBook Pro did the 2016. Maybe a little more in some cases.\nThat aligns with Jonathan Morrison of TLD, who put the new machines through the most comprehensive real-world tests I've seen so far.\nIn some cases, it's up to 50% better. In other cases, just a few minutes here, a few minutes there. That might not seem like much to someone who only renders a couple of videos a week. To someone who renders a couple of videos every 15 minutes \u2014 which isn't uncommon at a production house \u2014 it makes all the difference in the world.\nEspecially when you have a director, artist, or client on the other end with far less time than money chomping at the bit to iterate and sign off on every shot.\nThat's what makes real-world testing so important. Downloading an Intel Power Gadget and throwing up a video, blog post, or Reddit thread, not understanding anything about benchmarks, CPU vs. GPU load, what's hitting an accelerator or what's hitting AVX2, what's being measured and how frequently, whether or not the tool is up-to-date or tuned for the system it's being used on, or how it might affect the results, especially if it's just to get attention or spout off conspiracy theories, ends up contributing to the noise, not the useful pool of data points.\nAnd, by the way, if all of that sounded like a bunch of jargon\u2026 or Dothraki to you, that's because it is. It's the stuff old-fashioned computer geeks lived for, but it's increasingly meaningless to modern mainstream customers.\nThe new silicon normal\nWe're living in an age where Moore's law \u2014 or more often House's Law \u2014 which predicted performance would double roughly every 18 months, is dead or dying. And, as computing continues to become more mobile, and pro-level computing more mainstream, aggressive thermal management in constrained enclosures is something we're all going to have to come to terms with.\nIt's the reason why Apple doesn't break out things like RAM or frequencies on iPhone or iPad and why, I think, Apple is increasingly viewing the Intel chips inside the Mac as an implementation detail. At least until it's ready with an alternative.\nSure, in a perfect world, I think Apple and everyone else would have far preferred it if Intel weren't so far behind on its roadmap. If Cannon Lake had actually followed Skylake, the process shrink had happened on schedule, the tick had continued to tock, and we never had optimization cycles like Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake, and whatever else gets crammed in between, or more cores used as a fallback for performance gains.\nGiven that, I totally get how a few people who prefer power over portability and don't really get how Apple's product development process works, would have vastly preferred the MacBook go thick with a couple of F-22 Raptor vents welded onto a 17-inch chassis so frequencies never fell below base.\nBut, Apple seems to think the iMac and especially iMac Pro better covers those requirements and wants to keep its pro portable\u2026 really portable.\nMore to come\nI was originally planning to post my review yesterday, but, turns out it's going to take a couple more days. In the meantime, I'd love to know what you think. Hit the comments below.",

        "title": "Apple's First MacBook Pro With Retina Display is Now 'Vintage'",
        "body": "On June 11, 2012, at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced its first MacBook Pro with a Retina display. Impressed by its thinness, the crowd at Moscone West erupted with a huge round of applause.\nThe notebook was also praised in many reviews, which awarded it top marks for its mix of functionality and portability. Marco Arment, a well-known developer, even called it \"the best laptop ever made,\" with a \"crowd-pleasing design.\"\n\"Introduced in 2012, less than a year after Steve Jobs died, I see it as the peak of Jobs' vision for the Mac,\" said Arment, in a blog post last year.\nIn addition to being the first MacBook Pro with a Retina display, the 2012 model had a much slimmer design compared to previous models, after Apple removed the built-in Ethernet port and optical disc drive for CDs/DVDs. The external design of the notebook remained largely unchanged through 2015.\nDespite being thinner, the 2012 to 2015 era MacBook Pro had an array of connectivity options, including a pair of Thunderbolt and USB-A ports, an HDMI port, a SD card slot, and a MagSafe power adapter that breaks away safely if tugged.\nI/O on 2012 MacBook Pro with Retina display\nBy comparison, the 2016 and later MacBook Pro has two or four Thunderbolt 3 ports, depending on the model, that can deliver power, USB, DisplayPort, HDMI, and VGA over a single cable. Apple in turn removed dedicated USB-A and HDMI ports, an SD card reader, and MagSafe from the notebook.\nI/O on 2016-and-later MacBook Pro\nWhile the latest MacBook Pro lineup hasn't led to any significant declines in Mac sales, which Apple reports on a quarterly basis, a subset of customers continue to favor the older models. In fact, Apple continues to sell one configuration of the 2015 MacBook Pro , priced from $1,999 in the United States.\nFor those clinging to a 2012 model, however, there's a bit of bad, but inevitable, news.\nJust over six years after Apple released the Mid 2012 model 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, which is more than a fair amount of time, Apple has officially classified it as \"vintage\" or \"obsolete\" depending on the region.\nWhat this means is that at least five years have passed since the model was last manufactured, meaning that Apple and Apple Authorized Service Providers are no longer obligated to provide hardware service or replacement parts, except in the state of California and Turkey, where required by law.\nOf course, if you own a 2012 MacBook Pro, there is nothing stopping you from following one of iFixit's many do-it-yourself repair guides.\nApple routinely updates its vintage and obsolete products list with additional devices as they age, so this was to be expected eventually, but it's still somewhat of a sad reminder that the first MacBook Pro with Retina display has nearly reached the end of its life. Anyone still using one is now on their own in terms of hardware.\nApple's support team should still be able to answer questions about macOS and be able to perform software troubleshooting if needed.\nApple's website does not list the Late 2012 model 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, released in October 2012, as \"vintage\" yet. Only the 15-inch model, released in June 2012, carries this distinction.",

        "title": "Tested: Thermal conditions in the 2018 i9 MacBook Pro dramatically hampering performance",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nAppleInsider has both an i7 and i9 2018 MacBook Pro on hand, and it's time to do our own testing on the thermal throttling situation that positively afflicts the i9 model \u2014 at least at launch.\nHow this began\nIntel's 2.9GHz six-core Core i9 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 4.8GHz is offered as a premium $300 option on Apple's 2018 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, but according to Lee, the chip is unable to reach its full potential due to the laptop's design.\nIn a video posted to his YouTube channel on Tuesday, Dave Lee shows the top-of-the-line MacBook Pro running Adobe Premiere Pro at surprisingly low clock speeds. Tests conducted put the average clock speed of the processors under load at around 2.2GHz, well below the advertised 2.9GHz.\n\"This i9 in this MacBook can't even maintain the base clock speed,\" Lee said. \"Forget about Turbos and all that stuff, it can't even maintain the 2.9GHz base clock, which is absurd. This CPU is an unlocked, over-clockable chip, but all of that CPU potential is wasted inside this chassis, or more the thermal solution that's inside here.\"\nThe internet's reaction to Lee's findings was about as expected.\nWhat is thermal design point?\nThe Thermal Design Point (TDP) is defined by Intel as the \"average power the processor dissipates when operating at base frequency with all cores active under a high-complexity workload.\" In short, it advises of how hot a processor can get when running at un-boosted capacity, and how much in the way of cooling systems a device manufacturer has to put in place to mitigate the generated heat. More on \"unboosted\" in a bit.\nProcessors are created to run at a variety of different TDP levels, depending on their intended market. Processors meant for desktop computers can afford to have a higher TDP, while notebooks, mobile devices, and tablets tend to use processors with lower TDP values, due to the difficulty of cooling the chip down.\nAccording to Intel Ark, the processor manufacturer's specifications website for all of its chips, the 2.9GHz Core i9-8950HK has a TDP of 45 Watts, the same TDP as the Core i7-8850H and Core i7-8750H. The TDP itself is low, so it shouldn't require an excessive amount of cooling, and with identical TDPs across the board, this means that Apple could add the same cooling system across the board, regardless of selected processor.\nNotably, the 45-Watt TDP of the three processors used in the 2018 15-inch MacBook Pro line is the same as for the 3.1GHz Core i7-7920HQ, the processor used in the 2017 MacBook Pro.\nWhile a processor is cool, it will exceed its normal operating clockspeed up to its boost speed. This generates more heat, of course.\nAs that heat builds, the processor will slow down to help dissipate the heat in conjunction with the cooling system. It can even go lower than the normal operating clockspeed if need be to prevent damage.\nThis is why Lee was seeing clockspeeds lower than the normal operating speed \u2014 the processor decided it was too hot, and slowed down well past the normal speed to keep heat generation down to what it could dissipate through the cooling system.\nThe benchmarks\nLee's test was on Adobe Premiere \u2014 a real world test, albeit one using software that performs better with an Nvidia GPU rather than an AMD one.\nAccording to Geekbench, the 2018 MacBook Pro have astounding benchmarks. The \"baseline\" 2018 15-inch MacBook Pro with i7-8750H processor has a 21042 in multi-core performance, ranging to a 22439 for the six-core i9-8850HK in the high-end MacBook Pro.\nThe benchmarks have come under fire from critics, with them saying that there are \"breaks\" to smooth out the performance. However, that does not appear to be the case.\nWhile there are pauses in the test, they are done at the end of each test, not in the middle. So, individual tests are performed under full load, with no cool-down period during the test to keep processor speeds low.\nIn theory, the chips kept cool should be capable of delivering the performance illustrated by the crowdsourced Geekbench testing.\nOur own testing\nWe shifted to a different benchmark for our own series of tests. Using Cinebench 15, we ran 10 total runs on the i9 MacBook Pro.\nImmediately after starting the first test, the CPU clock speed shot up to 4.17 GHz. It rapidly drops to 3.86GHz until it hits the chip critical temperature of 100C. It then drops nearly immediately to 2.57GHz and also nearly immediately drops to 84C.\\\nThe speed of the processor varied between 2.33GHz and 2.9GHz generally, with one profound dip to 2.02GHz, and then the range drops to a peak of 2.65Ghz.\nThe first time we ran the test, it hit 921. The second time it scored an 877, with an average across the 10 tests of 906.\nWe ran the same tests on the base i7 equipped MacBook Pro and got relatively similar results \u2014 which should not have been the case given the difference between the i7 and i9. Out of the gate, the i7 jumps to 3.8GHz, just below the advertised boosted clock rate of 4.1GHz for that chipset\nAfter several back-to-back tests, keeping the processors warm and the fans running, we were able to regularly get impressive scores of up to 916. Using Intel Power Gadget, we clocked the processor speed averaging around 2.3Ghz and 2.6GHz, almost exactly what we were getting with the i9.\nFor our full reviews of both the i7 and i9 2018 MacBook Pros, we're going to hook them up to an external Graphics Processing Unit to see how much the thermal condition varies, when some of the heavy lifting is moved out of the MacBook Pro's chassis.\nThe same processors in other manufacturer's computers perform the tests faster, and with less throttling \u2014 but all machines with the i9 chip do it to one level or another.\nThe core of the issue\nApple's 2016 MacBook Pro chassis was designed more than two years ago. We got the first glimpse of it in a photograph in May of 2016.\nAt the time, Intel was promising smaller and smaller dies, with lower and lower TDP to go with it. The company didn't make its own die-shrink projections. Even the processor in the MacBook Pro currently is well over 18 months late, according to Intel's ever-shifting timetables.\nOdds are, Apple was counting on this when it developed the enclosure.\nApple is hardly the only vendor dealing with i9 thermal conditions, and like we said, Premiere performs far better with Nvidia GPU silicon than AMD Radeon gear which explains most of the Dell ripping through the test. However, while related, this isn't really the meat of the matter given that Lee put the MacBook Pro in the freezer and got better completion speeds out of it.\nVideo producer Lee suggested that the entire MacBook Pro cooling solution, an Apple-designed heatsink and fan module, is insufficient for the beefy (and hot) i9 Intel silicon as it stands.\nWe don't know how well Lee's machine was running from a cooling efficiency standpoint, but given the history of the channel, we aren't expecting anything out of the ordinary. Our machines' cooling systems are running fine, and as expected.\nSo, Lee is probably not wrong in his conclusions, given our own testing on the matter.\nApple, and users, have choices\nThis isn't a super-crisis, as long as this isn't another thermal paste situation, like back in the relative olden days. All manufacturers have to deal with it, and what varies is when the throttling kicks in as a result of the heat dissipation system engineering.\nAnd, it is rectifiable after-the-fact to some extent.\nThe most obvious solution right now is for Apple alter the peak speed of the processor by adjusting the power that the chip gets. Ironically, slowing the peak speed of the processor may allow it to finish tasks quicker, as it will slow down less to keep the CPU cool.\nAs PC overclockers are aware, this is a setting that can be altered. But, not in hardware by users as we are far, far down the road from jumpers that set clock speeds on Macs. We are presently looking at a few software options, and we'll get back to you with our findings.\nIn an oddity of testing the fourth Cinebench run on the i9 MacBook Pro came in higher than the first, at 945. We expect that this is because the fans were already running at a good clip when we restarted the test.\nSo, Apple can also change the fan speed thresholds to accommodate a CPU load better, by setting them to kick in sooner, and faster than it does at present. This probably won't completely eliminate the thermal situation, but it will lengthen the time it will take to get there at the cost of a louder device when under heavy load. Users can do this with Macs Fan Control, or similar utility.",

        "title": "Siri on iOS Answered 78.5% of Queries Correctly in Latest Test, Trailing Google Assistant at 85.5%",
        "body": "Five months after performing a test that put the smart speakers of multiple companies in the spotlight to determine how well they performed in various categories, Loup Ventures is back today with an IQ test focused entirely on digital AI assistants. To get the necessary results, the researchers asked Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, and Cortana 800 questions each on a smartphone, and compared their findings to a previous AI test held in April 2017.\nFor Siri in the new test, Apple's AI helper understood 99 percent of the queries and answered 78.5 percent of them correctly. That's an improvement on a similar AI-focused test from April 2017 (66.1 percent of 800 questions answered correctly). While Loup Ventures looked at similar methodologies when testing smart speakers in February, the researchers explain that it's \"not worthwhile to compare\" the results across these tests since \"the use cases differ greatly between digital assistants and smart speakers.\"\nThis is particularly true for Siri on HomePod, which performs well in certain areas but is largely limited to the amount of actions it can perform on the speaker itself. This led Apple's HomePod to become relegated to the \"bottom of the totem pole\" in an AI assistant performance test during Loup Venture's smart speaker research in February, with Siri answering 52.3 percent of 782 total questions correctly, across the same five categories as the new test.\nLoup Ventures grades each digital assistant on two metrics: \"Did it understand what was being asked?\" and \"Did it deliver a correct response?\" Questions came from five categories, including Local (example: \"Where is the nearest coffee shop?\"), Commerce (\"Can you order me more paper towels?\"), Navigations (\"How do I get to uptown on the bus?\"), Information (\"Who do the Twins play tonight?\"), and Command (\"Remind me to call Steve at 2pm today\").\nCharts via Loup Ventures\nGoogle Assistant has the edge in every category except Command. Siri\u2019s lead over the Assistant in this category is odd, given they are both baked into the OS of the phone rather than living on a 3rd party app (as Cortana and Alexa do). We found Siri to be slightly more helpful and versatile (responding to more flexible language) in controlling your phone, smart home, music, etc. Our question set also includes a fair amount of music-related queries (the most common action for smart speakers). Apple, true to its roots, has ensured that Siri is capable with music on both mobile devices and smart speakers.\nQuestions were asked of Siri on an iPhone running iOS 11.4, Google Assistant on a Pixel XL, Alexa on the iOS app, and Cortana on the iOS app. Siri's best category was Command (90 percent of questions answered correctly), outperforming all rivals when asked to control aspects of the iPhone, smart home products, Apple Music, and more. Following Command, Siri performed well in Local (87 percent), Navigation (83 percent), and began dipping in Information (70 percent) and Commerce (60 percent).\nGoogle Assistant was the top digital assistant in all categories except Command, with Loup Ventures particularly liking Google's \"featured snippets\" feature that reads off search results of voice queries and is often \"exactly what you're looking for.\" Both Alexa and Cortana were lesser performers in the test due to the iOS app for each limiting what the assistants can do on an iPhone, unlike Siri's ability to perform tasks all over iOS and not just in one app.\nIn total, Google Assistant answered 85.5 percent of the 800 questions asked correctly and understood all of them, compared to Siri's 78.5 percent answered correctly and 11 misunderstood. Alexa correctly answered 61.4 percent and misunderstood 13, while Cortana was the \"laggard\" and correctly answered 52.4 percent and misunderstood 19.\nOver the 15 month period since April 2017, Siri improved by 13 percentage points, with Loup Ventures pointing out that it was \"impressed with the speed at which the technology is advancing\" for most of the assistants. The researchers went on to explain that many of the issues they had last year were erased by \"improvements to natural language processing and inter-device connectivity.\"\nLoup Ventures also sees more improvements coming down the line, particularly for Siri. This fall, the digital assistant will gain new abilities with Apple's upcoming \"Siri Shortcuts\" feature in iOS 12, which will let users create automations between apps that can be easily triggered through voice commands. The researches say they are \"eager to test that feature\" when it launches within iOS 12, likely coming in September.",

        "title": "Apple wins a Design Patent for 'AirPower' prior to its Launch",
        "body": "Last month Patently Apple posted a report titled \"Apple Announcing AirPower too ahead of time was a Mistake.\" The report covered a Bloomberg report attempting to explain the delay in delivering Apple's new inductive charging pad called 'AirPower.' Hopefully Apple will officially launch AirPower next month when they introduce their next generation of iPhones or at least have it ready for the holiday season.\nOur report today covers Apple being granted a design patent for AirPower in Hong Kong, China in addition to covering their ClassKit trademark filing in both the U.S. and Hong Kong.\nUnlike \"patent applications,\" design patents published by the U.S. and/or any Patent and Trademark Office never reveals pertinent information about a particular design. All we get are simple patent figure visuals as presented below.\nIn other IP News, Apple filed for 'ClassKit' trademark earlier this month under #88023583 in the U.S. and filed it under International Class 9 covering \"computer software used in developing other software applications; application development software.\" Apple filed for it in Hong Kong under #304585258.\nSeparately, Apple's icon for 'ClassKit' was filed with the U.S. Patent Office back in Q1 2018 under #87856167 and is now close to being granted registered status. It's in one of its final phases of being open to the public for opposition feedback. Once completed without complications, it'll be granted to Apple as an RTM (Registered Trademark).\nAbout Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

        "title": "PSA: Edison Email app has the ability to read user emails. Employees have read approximately 8000 user emails to improve their smart reply feature.",
        "body": "Some third-party email providers that work with services like Gmail are letting their employees read customer emails to create new and optimized software tools, according to an article warning about third-party email apps and services published today by The Wall Street Journal.\nReturn Path, a service for email marketers that has 163 app partners, two years ago allowed its employees to read approximately 8,000 full customer emails to train the company's software.\nSimilarly, Edison Software, a company that makes the Edison Mail app for iOS, had employees read the emails of hundreds of users to craft a new \"smart replies\" feature.\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, neither company asked users for specific permission to read their emails, but have said the practice is covered in their user agreements. Employees who read the emails were governed by \"strict protocols,\" and in Edison's case, user information was redacted.\nEdison, Return Path, and other third-party email services also use computer scanning to analyze emails, a common practice. For its article, The Wall Street Journal interviewed over two dozen current and former employees from email and data companies.\nGoogle no longer scans the inboxes of Gmail users itself as of last year for privacy reasons, but it continues to allow third-party software developers to do so. Other email services, like Yahoo and Microsoft, are similarly impacted, providing access with user consent.\nReturn Path, Edison, and other developers of apps that work with Gmail and similar email services don't appear to have misused customer information, but many customers are likely to be concerned about the fact that employees at some email companies are reading their emails. Many customers are also likely unaware they're consenting to such practices when signing up for a third-party email app.\nIn a written statement, Google said that it provides data to outside developers who have been vetted and who have been granted permission by users to access their email. Google says its own employees read emails only in \"very specific cases where you ask us to and give consent, or where we need to for security purposes, such as investigating a bug or abuse.\"\nAs The Wall Street Journal points out, customers should be wary of email apps because Google does not have strong consumer protections in place when it comes to email. It's a simple process to build an app that connects to Gmail accounts, and with permission to access the Gmail inbox granted, a developer can see the entire contents of the inbox. It's not just large corporations that are able to get to this data - Google also gives permission to one-person startups, and data privacy protections can vary.\nCustomers concerned with how their emails are handled by third-party apps should stick with first-party apps such as Gmail or Inbox by Gmail for Gmail users and/or take a close look at the app's privacy policies and ask further questions about data usage.",

        "body": "Apple has combined its various artificial intelligence divisions into a new structure led by recent hire John Giannandrea, formerly Google\u2019s head of search and AI. TechCrunch first reported the restructuring earlier today, and Apple confirmed the change with an update to its executive leadership page. Giannandrea will now be in charge of Apple\u2019s machine learning division, its Siri team, and the Core ML team. Core ML is the machine learning API Apple launched last year to help native AI tasks and AI-focused apps and services from third-party developers run more efficiently on iOS devices.\nGiannandrea\u2019s official title will be chief of machine learning and AI strategy, and it\u2019s clear Apple leadership is putting its faith in the executive to help beef up its AI efforts. Apple lags behind in key AI areas like natural language processing and computer vision, both of which are necessary to power voice assistant features within Siri and new, more cutting-edge technology like augmented reality apps that rely on object recognition.\nBecause of Apple\u2019s commitment to user privacy and its less active role in the AI research community, its been unable to either amass useful machine learning data sets to train new algorithms on or attract the type of research talent that Facebook, Google, and other Silicon Valley giants have paid top dollar for in recent years.",

        "body": "If you were hoping to benefit from fast charging of this year\u2019s iPhones, that may not be possible with many third-party chargers \u2026\nWe\u2019ve been hearing increasing reports that this year\u2019s iPhones will, for the first time, be supplied with USB-C cables \u2013 along with an 18W charger capable of fast-charging.\nThat\u2019s good news, but if you like to have chargers in more than one place \u2013 for example, at home and at work \u2013 you may find your options limited.\nA report last week said that supply constraints mean that the official Apple 18W charger won\u2019t be available for purchase separately for some time after the launch of the new iPhones, and a new report today suggests that buying third-party chargers may not be as simple as it seems. Macotakara cites multiple supply-chain sources stating that fast-charging will only be available from certified chargers.\nThe report says that even if a charger offers 18W, the iPhone may limit its power draw to just 2.5W unless both charger and cable conform to a USB Type-C Authentication standard.\nIt should be stressed that this doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll only be able to use Apple chargers and cables: the standard is supported by more than 50 companies. But it does mean you won\u2019t just be able to pick up a random charger from Amazon and expect it to deliver fast-charging, no matter what power output it may claim. You\u2019ll need to check that it meets the USB Type-C Authentication standard for power delivery.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nRumors of a more powerful 18-Watt USB-C wall charger supposedly being bundled with this fall's iPhone releases have been bolstered, with the surfacing of photographs appearing to depict an engineering sample of the alleged accessory.\nPhotographs published by Chongdiantou and spotted by Macotakara show the charging plug from three different angles. Along with showing the side and plug prongs in one shot, a second simply shows the USB-C connection at the top of the device, where the USB-C to Lightning connector would be inserted.\nThe third photograph is blurry but readable, showing it to be an engineering sample. At the bottom the output data claims it can provide up to 5 Volts of power at 3 Amps, equating to 15 Watts delivered to the iPhone, or for 9V to be delivered at 2A, namely 18W.\nWhile this is one of the first credible photographs of the rumored charger, there is no guarantee that it is genuine. A May report included alleged renderings of the European version of the iPhone charger, again offering 18W of power.\nCurrently, iPhones ship with the same 5W USB-A charger, despite the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X all supporting Fast Charging, using a USB-C to Lightning cable and a charger with a higher wattage. Fast Charging allows an iPhone to charge to 50 percent of capacity within 30 minutes, which is currently possible using the USB-C wall charger supplied with the MacBook or MacBook Pro, albeit at a relatively high cost.",

        "body": "Companies pay dearly to sponsor the World Cup. There\u2019s no event more widely watched than soccer\u2019s premier tournament\u2014over 3 billion people tuned in in 2014\u2014and FIFA, the sport\u2019s governing body, is expected to generate around $1.6 billion in revenue from marketing this year\u2019s cup.\nBut instead of paying to emblazon its logo on match-side billboards, Apple took a different tack\u2014and it may not even have been on purpose.\nAdvertisement\nPlayers from around the world have been seen wearing Apple\u2019s AirPods wireless earbuds, and Beats headphones, which Apple also owns, before matches, disembarking planes, or even returning to their home countries in defeat.\nFIFA has pretty strict rules around what it calls \u201cambush marketing,\u201d where a brand pays players to wear or use its products before or during World Cup games, even though that company has not paid to be an official World Cup sponsor. It\u2019s why any player you see wearing Beats headphones before a game, for example, has the company\u2019s logo taped over.\nBut both Beats and AirPods have a distinctive look that is difficult to mask, even with the branding obscured. While covered-up Beats were a big marketing win for Apple at the 2014 World Cup, just months after it had acquired the company, AirPods are a more subtle sell this time around. The minuscule $160 earbuds are one of the few Apple products that don\u2019t have any Apple branding on them at all. But when you see them on a player, it\u2019s almost impossible to mistake them for anything else.\nAdvertisement\nApple doesn\u2019t break out headphones sales, instead lumping them in a category called \u201cOther products\u201d on its earnings reports, which also includes Apple Watch, iPod, and sales of other accessories. But by all accounts, AirPods have been a success since they were first released in late 2016.\nApple wasn\u2019t immediately available to comment on whether it was working with specific players at the World Cup, although it definitely has worked with soccer players in the past to market its Beats headphones. Perhaps coincidentally, Apple has been running an advertising campaign during the World Cup entitled, \u201cHow to shoot Football on iPhone X.\u201d\nHere are a few shots of players donning Apple products at this year\u2019s cup:\nMexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa, landing in Russia, sported AirPods.\nAdvertisement\nAs did his teammate Javier Hernandez.\nGerman midfielder Julian Draxler also stepped off the plane with Apple earbuds on.\nAdvertisement\nBelgian striker Romelu Lukaku preferred a pair of taped-up Beats.\nEngland\u2019s Jesse Lingard showed up for training before the team\u2019s semi-final match in AirPods.\nAdvertisement\nAs did his teammates Kyle Walker and Danny Welbeck.\nAlthough their compatriot Marcus Rashford preferred to wear Beats.\nAdvertisement\nThe Argentinian team showed up in a combination of Beats and AirPods, although Lionel Messi, arguably the world\u2019s greatest player, chose to wear nothing.\nSimilarly, Portugal\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo only had earrings in his ears, although his teammate donned some AirPods as they disembarked in Russia.\nAdvertisement\nAfter a disappointing showing at the World Cup, Brazilian star Neymar prepared to return home, wearing AirPods.\nHis teammate Willian, however, seems to be fine with Apple\u2019s more traditional wired earbuds.\nAdvertisement\nThanks to reader Martin Soler for first pointing this out to Quartz.",

Indicators from this source had a solid track record of accuracy last year, but it\u2019s notable that an April filing on new iPhones is yet to see payoff in new products.\nPrevious to the iPhone report, Apple has registered unannounced products in the Eurasian database, with public launches about a month later.\nAs a quick recap of this source\u2019s record, in August 2016, Apple filed trademarks for iPhone 7, Apple Watch Series 2, Apple Watch Series 1 and \u2018AirPods\u2019. Obviously, all four of these products were indeed unveiled at the September event a few weeks later; with the leak being one of the first mentions of the AirPods branding for Apple\u2019s truly-wireless earbuds.\nAhead of WWDC 2017, the filings again tipped the hat on updated Magic Keyboard, new MacBooks and iPads ahead of Apple\u2019s announcements. In February of this year, Apple filed for the new $329 iPad in February, ahead of its March education event where the product was debuted.\nThis brings us to the April report, where eleven new iPhone model identifiers turned up in the database. It is now many months on from that filing \u2026 and there are no new iPhones to show for it. This is the first black mark in the track record, and it gives some doubt to the relevancy of this latest filing on iPads and Macs.\nIt is possible that Apple has tweaked its strategy regarding how it registers products in these regions to make it less easy to predict its upcoming announcements \u2014 all part of its renewed focus on product secrecy.\nNevertheless, here\u2019s what this latest filing suggests: there will be five new Mac computers with model numbers A1931, A1932, A1988, A1989, A1990 and five new iPads with model numbers A1876, A2013, A1934, A1979, A2014. The Macs are apparently running High Sierra and the iPads are running iOS 11.\nRegarding the Macs, the most likely deduction is that the continuous string of the last three (from A1988-A1990) of these are new MacBook Pro SKUs. We have already seen some evidence of a significant MacBook spec upgrade in the offing, and a MacBook Pro refresh is very much due. The products representing the other two might be the new 13-inch Retina \u2018MacBook Air\u2019 model that\u2019s been making the rounds in the rumor mill for a while now.\nThe iPad model identifiers are harder to reason about as there is no obvious grouping to the numbers. Obviously, we are expecting new iPad Pros with Face ID, no home button, and thin bezels to be launched in the fall, so that accounts for at least some of the identifiers.\nIt is weird that neither of these new products are said to be running the new operating systems. This could mean we see an earlier launch than the usual September timeframe, but given the parallel weirdness with the still-unaccounted-for eleven iPhone identifiers, we don\u2019t feel confident drawing any hard conclusions at this stage.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Apple has a surprising amount of unsold iPhone X inventory | Cult of Mac",
        "body": "Apple is sitting on a massive stockpile of unsold iPhone X devices, a new report claims. The backlog reportedly equals almost three times the number of the high-end handsets already shipped.\nIf correct, this would be unusual for Apple. The company normally proves very good at forecasting the number of units it should manufacture. The rumor suggests that, even nine months after the iPhone X went on sale, Apple is still trying to get to grips with the exact demand for the device.\nThese aren\u2019t necessarily all finished handsets. The report suggests that Apple\u2019s inventory comprises a mix of finished chassis and assorted other parts and components. Digitimes, citing sources in Apple\u2019s supply chain, notes that:\n\u201cThe supply chain makers pointed out that they have been willing to cope with Apple\u2019s demand to build up inventory due to the company\u2019s proven records for cooperation previously, but they were caught by surprise this time.\u201d\nEven if it is true, however, the report points out that the iPhone X buildup hasn\u2019t affected Apple\u2019s performance.\nParts for 2018 iPhones?\nThe report also notes that Apple could repurpose the unsold components for next-gen iPhones set to launch this September.\nManufacturers in Apple\u2019s supply chain struggled to produce enough TrueDepth sensors in the run-up to the iPhone X launch. The advanced sensors power Face ID, the facial recognition system that replaced Touch ID on the flagship iPhone. The production delays meant iPhone X did not arrive until November 2017. That was a full month and a half after the iPhone 8 launch.\nWith many people predicting that this year\u2019s iPhone refresh will produce the super-cycle Apple has been expecting, this fall\u2019s new iPhones will \u201cbring a sales boom that will effectively clear out their inventory,\u201d the sources said.\nApple will reportedly release three new iPhones this year, including one LCD iPhone and two OLED models. These will include a 5.8-inch iPhone X successor, a 6.5-inch iPhone X Plus model, and a more affordable 6.1-inch LCD iPhone.",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Rumored MacBook Air Successor Said to Use Intel\u2019s Kaby Lake Refresh Processors",
        "body": "Apple is widely expected to launch a new lower-priced notebook later this year, likely with a 13-inch Retina display and a starting price below $1,000. It's unclear if it will be branded as a MacBook, MacBook Air, or otherwise, but it'll be a new lower-cost, lower-spec option below the MacBook Pro.\nAccording to a translated report from Taiwanese publication Economic Daily News, the notebook will be powered by Intel's eighth-generation Kaby Lake Refresh processors, released in the second half of 2017.\nThe translated report suggests that Apple's decision to use the Kaby Lake Refresh processors, manufactured based on a 14nm process, is due to repeated delays with Intel's transition to Cannon Lake chips, based on a 10nm process. The latest word is that Cannon Lake won't be ready until the end of 2019.\nThe Kaby Lake Refresh lineup includes quad-core Core i5 and Core i7 processors with base clock speeds between 1.6GHz and 1.9GHz, and max Turbo Boost speeds between 3.4GHz and 4.2GHz. The 15W chips feature integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620, with support for up to 32GB of DDR4 or LPDDR3 RAM.\nThis means Apple's lower-priced notebook would be significantly faster than the latest MacBook Air models, which is unsurprising, given they use Intel's fifth-generation, dual-core Core i5 and Core i7 processors released in 2015. It'd also be much faster than the 12-inch MacBook, which uses ultra-low-power chips.\nKaby Lake Refresh chips are already nearly one year old, and Intel will be releasing faster Whiskey Lake processors suitable for Apple's notebook in the second half of 2018, but they might not be ready in time, as manufacturing needs to begin over the summer for the notebook to launch in the fall.\nIt appears Apple will have a jam-packed September event, with a trio of new iPhones, Apple Watch Series 4 models, new AirPods, and AirPower, so the Mac and iPad Pro could see some attention at an October event.\nIt's not entirely clear how Apple will shake up its notebook lineup below the MacBook Pro. The new notebook could be the first MacBook Air with a Retina display, or replace the MacBook Air entirely, or slot into the MacBook family, with price adjustments across the line, but it all remains to be seen.\nApple's plans for the notebook have been detailed by reliable Apple sources Ming-Chi Kuo and Mark Gurman in recent months.\nBeyond the mid-range notebook, an October event could see refreshes to the 12-inch MacBook lineup with Intel's upcoming low-power Amber Lake chips, a refreshed Mac mini with Kaby Lake Refresh chips, and new standard iMac models with faster processors and a significant display-related upgrade.",

Among the features coming soon is the ability to make phone calls, manage several timers at once, translate text, and more.\nAccording to iGeneration, you\u2019ll be able to use HomePod to make phone calls, answer a call, redial a number, search your call log, listen to messages on your voicemail, or make an emergency call. It\u2019s not entirely clear whether FaceTime Audio will be supported, although it sounds likely.\nHomePod\u2019s also expected to add the ability to search for a song based on its lyrics. This feature is also coming to iOS devices this Fall with iOS 12.\niGeneration also expects Apple\u2019s smart speaker to gain more information about food and nutrition, and public figures. It\u2019s also going to be easier to switch the Wi-Fi network the smart speaker is on. When your iPhone is on a different network, for example, switching HomePod to the new network will now be a seamless process. Currently, you need to reset the device to change network information.\nFinally, with the HomePod update, the device can help you locate your iPhone.\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here, and it\u2019s not yet known how some of the features mentioned here will work. Regardless, it sounds like Apple\u2019s prepared to make HomePod much more useful in the weeks ahead.\nFirst announced in June 2017, the $349 HomePod finally arrived in stores earlier this year. Apple\u2019s expected to introduce a less expensive model, perhaps under the Beats name, although it\u2019s not yet known when that might occur.\nThe HomePod update is likely to get released alongside the iOS 12 this fall.\nWhich new HomePod features are you hoping to see the most?

        "body": "The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office officially published a series of 40 newly granted patents for Apple Inc. today. In this particular report we cover two granted patents and two design patents. Apple's first granted patent covers their technology allowing displays to stretch and flex that will one day apply to iDevices, smart garments and possibly use with Project Titan. We wrap up this week's granted patent report with our traditional listing of the remaining granted patents that were issued to Apple today.\nPatent: iDevices with Soft Input-Output Components\nPatently Apple's other blog called Patently Mobile has covered the advances of flexible displays from Samsung for years. You could check out some of the major ones here: (one, two, three and four. The most interesting ones relate to a possible scrollable smart device. Today the US Patent & Trademark Office granted Apple a patent for their invention relating to flexible displays and electronics that will extend to specialty applications. Beyond applying their revealed technology to known devices such as a smartphone or tablet, Apple see's the technology being widely adopted into smart clothing, smart windows, applications in vehicles, furniture and more.\nPatently Apple covered this as a patent application in February 2017. You could check it out here for more graphics and details.\nApple's granted patent 10,026,721 was originally filed in Q4 2016 and published today by the US Patent and Trademark Office. Apple has a lot of work in this area. See our archives for more Apple patents covering flexible and foldable displays here.\nPatent: Electronic Devices with Gaze Detection\nApple's newly granted patent covers their invention relating to electronic devices such as portable electronic devices that have gaze detection capabilities. One or more gaze detection sensors such as a camera may be used by the electronic device to determine whether a user's gaze is directed towards the electronic device (e.g., whether the user of the electronic device is looking at the electronic device). In particular, the electronic device may use gaze detection sensors to determine whether or not the user is looking at a display portion of the electronic device.\nPatently Apple first covered Apple's invention as a patent application back in 2013. You could review the patent report here for more details and patent figures.\nApple's granted patent 10,025,380 has history going back to 2008.\nApple Granted Design Patents for iPhone Covers\nThe Remaining Patents granted to Apple Today\nPatently Apple presents only a brief summary of granted patents with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each Granted Patent is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office.
