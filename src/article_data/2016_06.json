        "title": "Ars Technica: If you kill the headphone jack, you need to replace it with something better",
        "body": "As the rumors that the next iPhone will drop the 3.5mm headphone jack have intensified, I\u2019ve been keeping tabs on the specific argument that Daring Fireball\u2019s John Gruber made yesterday: that removing the headphone jack from the iPhone is the modern-day equivalent of removing the floppy drive from the iMac in the late '90s. It caused some pain at the time, but it was the way things were moving anyway, and in the grand scheme of things it was a smart thing to do.\nThe people on the \u201cget rid of the headphone jack\u201d side of the debate normally choose some version of this position as justification: that the jack is \u201cold\u201d and so getting rid of it represents \u201cprogress.\u201d And the fact of the matter is that Apple has been pretty good at this kind of progress over the years, picking up new technologies like USB and SSDs and dropping aging ones like the DVD drive well before those technologies had gone (or ceased to be) mainstream.\nBut the headphone jack is not the floppy drive. It\u2019s not the 30-pin connector. It\u2019s not the DVD drive. It\u2019s not even USB Type-C. It\u2019s not, in other words, directly comparable to all those other times when Apple has been \u201cright\u201d to remove or change something, both because of the ubiquity of the headphone jack and the quality of the supposed replacements.\nFloppies sucked in big, obvious ways\nWhen Apple shipped the first iMacs without floppy drives in 1998, the problems with the technology were readily apparent: floppy disks had low capacities (especially relative to their physical size) and were failure-prone, slow, and noisy; just about the only thing they had going for them was how widespread they were. But clearly better technologies were already available\u2014the then-popular ZIP drives had many of the same problems but offered a lot more space, and the CD-ROM had already been established as a convenient, relatively cheap way to move a lot of data around. In the years immediately following, CD-Rs and RWs and then DVDs and the growing popularity of the Internet helped to end the reign of the floppy as a mainstream storage medium.\nAdvertisement\nIt's pretty much the same story for the DVD drive, which Apple ejected from the MacBook Air and then from the rest of the lineup between roughly 2008 and 2012. High-capacity, dirt-cheap USB drives and media streaming made comparatively inflexible, slow, large optical disks and drives unnecessary for mainstream consumers. Both Lightning and USB Type-C are significantly smaller, more usable connectors with wiring changes that were necessary for future growth.\nEach of these transitions caused some pain, but each of them also made sense even at the time, given that the new replacements for the outgoing technology had already arrived or were on the horizon. The proposed replacements for the headphone jack\u2014at least, the ones being proposed by the rumor mill at this point in time\u2014have the distinction both of being less widespread than the headphone jack and not obviously better than the headphone jack.\nAnd that\u2019s where a lot of the complaining is rooted. The headphone jack has shortcomings\u2014the waterproofing challenges are totally surmountable, but the jack takes up space inside a phone that could be used for battery or other components\u2014but those problems are minor enough that they are by far outweighed by the jack\u2019s convenience.\nConsider either Lightning or USB Type-C headphones, ignoring for a minute the fact that we may soon be entering a world in which there are two competing standards for headphone jacks where one perfectly adequate universal standard has existed for decades. These headphones would only work with devices with certain ports, and they would either need their own digital-to-analog converter (DAC) or the standards would need to allow the headphones to use the phones\u2019 internal DAC (audio over USB Type-C can theoretically do this, audio over Lightning can't). If the replacement is Lightning, all headphone makers will need to get their products blessed by Apple via the MFI accessory program. If Apple boots Lightning in favor of USB Type-C, it\u2019s probably better in the long term, but it\u2019s the 30-pin-to-Lightning transition all over again, and that transition technically won\u2019t even be complete until iOS 10 officially drops support for the iPhone 4S and iPad 2.\nIf the replacement is Bluetooth, that standard at least has the benefit of being more universal and widely used than Lightning or USB Type-C. But Bluetooth headphones are and always have been relatively expensive, they need to be charged, and they\u2019re prone to interference and pairing problems\u2014if Bluetooth was going to kill the headphone jack, it has already had many, many years in which to do it.\nAdvertisement\nAnd if (as has been rumored) the replacement is some third option, an Apple proprietary wireless option that solves most of Bluetooth\u2019s annoyances but is incompatible with not only other devices but also older Apple devices, that comes with its own problems. You would solve Bluetooth\u2019s connectivity problems but not its battery problems, and you would add Lightning\u2019s broad compatibility and licensing issues.\nNone of these alternatives are slam-dunk replacements for the headphone jack. There's an obvious, clearly defined internal logic to the floppy disk thing (and the other changes of its ilk) that isn\u2019t present here.\nThe headphone jack has been literally everywhere for figuratively forever\nKilling the headphone jack is bigger than getting rid of floppies or even the reliable old rectangular USB port. The 3.5mm headphone jack is well over 50 years old, and it has been one constant in the evolution of modern consumer electronics. The Walkman. The Macintosh 128K. The Game Boy. Countless computers from IBM, Compaq, HP, Gateway, Dell, Acer, Lenovo, Toshiba, Sony, Asus, and others. The iPod. And yes, even the Samsung Galaxy. The headphone jack has been there for all of it, and today I can throw five different gadgets in my bag with one set of headphones without having to worry about it.\nWhere\u2019s the replacement? What\u2019s coming that will do what the headphone jack does, but better? What does Apple have planned that will justify the dongles and the incompatibility and the waste that come with replacing a port that has been truly ubiquitous in consumer technologies since before I was born? I\u2019m still running into 30 pin connectors in cars and in hotels, and that was one port that one company used in three product lines for a total of eight years.\nYou can replace the headphone jack, but you shouldn\u2019t do it lightly. When people complain, it\u2019s not just reflexive whining from change-averse graybeards. The jack\u2019s age and ubiquity are features, not liabilities, and they\u2019re features you\u2019re going to need to think about when you try to replace it. I\u2019m willing to be convinced. But it\u2019s on Apple and the companies that have already begun ejecting headphone jacks from their products to present a strong argument, and so far they\u2019re doing a bad job.",

        "body": "A survey by Creative Strategies found that while almost all American iPhone users have at least tried Siri, only 3% have ever used it in public. The firm expresses surprise at the apparent reason for this.\nWith public usage as low as 3% for iPhone users, it seems users are still uncomfortable talking to their devices. Even more fascinating is this happens in the US where consumers are accustomed to talking loudly on phones in public.\nHighest usage of Siri was, unsurprisingly, in the car, where it hit 62%. Use at home averaged 39% across all the voice assistants surveyed, falling to just 1.3% at work where both the embarrassment factor and a desire not to disturb others likely combine \u2026\nWhile 98% of iPhone users have at least tried Siri, the company found that more than two-thirds use it only occasionally.\nIt would be interesting to compare the results for mainstream consumers with the far techier audience here, so please take our own poll and share your experiences in the comments.\nVia CNET",

Bluetooth 5 is expected to be a significant upgrade over the current version of the wireless standard, offering double the speed and four times the range of current low-energy Bluetooth transmissions, but the Bluetooth SIG says it will also offer much more support for connectionless services \u2014 things like beacons that can help people navigate inside buildings or out in the open.\nThe roadmap for the next version of Bluetooth was sketched out last year, but the SIG \u2014 which has tech giants like Apple, Intel, and Microsoft as backers \u2014 will officially lift the lid on Bluetooth 5 on June 16th in London. The group explains that it chose the name to simplify its marketing and make the wireless standard easier to understand for users.

        "body": "Game Center finally met its demise this morning with the unveiling of iOS 10, which effectively kills Apple\u2019s attempt at creating a gaming social network.\nStarting with iOS 10, the Game Center app will no longer be found on iPhones and iPads, after having been preinstalled on devices for years. Apple isn\u2019t just adding it to the list of stock iOS apps you can delete, though. It\u2019s actually getting rid of the platform altogether in favor of GameKit.\nApple\u2019s release notes for iOS 10 beta 1 reveal that developers will have to implement the required interface themselves if they use GameKit.\n\u201cThe Game Center app has been removed. If your game implements GameKit features, it must also implement the interface behavior necessary for the user to see these features. For example, if your game supports leaderboards, it could present a GKGameCenterViewController object or read the data directly from Game Center to implement a custom user interface.\u201d\nGame Center made its iOS debut in 2010 after gaming became a major focus of the App Store. The app eventually got ported over to the Mac, but wasn\u2019t widely used.",

        "title": "Report: \u2018Major iTunes overhaul\u2019 to be announced off at WWDC to simplify Apple\u2019s desktop music app",
        "body": "Digital Music News is once again reporting that Apple is contemplating removing iTunes downloads for good, focusing solely on its Apple Music streaming service for distribution. Reading between the lines, it sounds like Apple is open to multiple scenarios depending on future market conditions, which could include ditching traditional music download model. However, it doesn\u2019t sound like there are firm plans to do that anytime soon; Apple has already denied similar reports saying \u2018It\u2019s not true\u2019.\nMore interestingly is the report\u2019s take on Apple\u2019s WWDC plans for iTunes. It claims that Apple will unveil a major overhaul of the iTunes app to simplify the core functions of the app (music) and better present the different music offerings Apple has, removing points of confusion about how Apple Music works alongside the iTunes Store.\nThe iTunes UI update would make sense alongside a wider overhaul of Apple Music itself, which 9to5Mac first reported on earlier in the year and is also expected to feature at WWDC. The iOS 10 Music app will see major design changes including a focus on artwork and black/white UI chrome. Last month, iTunes 12.4 included a few design changes to various parts of the application such as the reintroduction of a sidebar for music navigation.\nOn Twitter, Mark Gurman is reporting that the WWDC iTunes update will be in a similar vein and will launch alongside the new version of OS X (likely renamed MacOS) in the fall. The \u2018major\u2019 iTunes changes will not include splitting out media types into dedicated applications. Rather than addressing the iTunes bloat issue, it appears Apple will refine its behemoth with various interface improvements and enhancements.\nBut..Apple will show off a redesigned iTunes for Mac app at WWDC. Will launch in the fall with 10.12. Coincides with redesigned Apple Music. \u2014 Mark Gurman (@markgurman) June 8, 2016\nSome of the new iTunes changes will no doubt incorporate the upgraded Apple Music features such as licensed lyrics integration for many tracks. The black/white UI revamp may also make its way to desktop iTunes for consistency.\nWWDC is expected to be a software-focused event with sources indicating that the announcements will not feature updates to Apple\u2019s product line, likely no new hardware at all. Apple will announce the next versions of its software for its various hardware lines however: iOS 10 for iPhone and iPad, OS X 10.12 for Macs (probably renaming to MacOS), watchOS 3 for Apple Watch and a new tvOS for Apple TV.\nThe keynote starts at 10 AM PT on Monday \u2014 stay tuned to 9to5Mac as we bring live coverage of all the announcements.",

        "body": "Apple started selling the Apple iPhone nine years ago today.\nHere is what Apple\u2019s press release had to say:\niPhone introduces an entirely new user interface based on a revolutionary multi-touch display and pioneering new software that allows users to control iPhone with just a tap, flick or pinch of their fingers. iPhone combines three products into one small and lightweight handheld device \u2013 a revolutionary mobile phone, a widescreen iPod, and the Internet in your pocket with best-ever applications on a mobile phone for email, web browsing and maps. iPhone ushers in an era of software power and sophistication never before seen in a mobile device, which completely redefines what users can do on their mobile phones.\nApple was right to describe the iPhone as revolutionary. It changed the world.\nBut what I find particularly remarkable is that despite Apple selling such a popular mobile computing device for nine years, there has still been no major outbreak of malware on the platform.\nThe attacks we have seen on iOS have either been against vulnerable jailbroken iPhones (a state which Apple has made harder to achieve with successive generations of the iOS operating system) or through sophisticated targeted attacks such as exploiting enterprise provisioning features, or infecting iOS devices through Mac OS X via a USB cable.\nThe fact that hackers had to go to the effort of publishing a tampered version of Apple\u2019s XCode library on third-party sites in the hope that iOS developers would download and use it to compile their code is testament to just how hard criminals have found it to sneak malware into the official App Store.\nThese factors have meant that if your iPhone ever gets infected by malware at all, there\u2019s a good chance that a state-sponsored attacker is responsible.\nSo, happy birthday iPhone. Yes, you have had your fair share of vulnerabilities, lock screen bypasses and poorly-coded third-party apps\u2026 but you have done a remarkable job of fending off major malware attacks.\nFound this article interesting?

Credit: Jhila Farzaneh/Mashable\nIf you think your cool new 5GB-per-month mobile data plan will be enough to last for a couple of years, you might be in for an unpleasant surprise.\nAccording to Ericsson's latest Mobility Report, released Wednesday, a mobile data consumption explosion is happening, with mobile traffic growing 60% between the first quarter of 2015 and 2016.\nAnd due to the rising number of smartphone subscriptions (especially for LTE-capable smartphones), and the increasing data consumption per subscriber, the trend will continue, with a predicted tenfold increase -- to 22GB per subscriber in North America -- in mobile traffic by the end of 2021.\nWestern Europeans will use a little less traffic by then, 18GB per month per subscriber, while folks in the Asia Pacific region will use up 7GB per month. However, due to a rapid growth of subscribers, the Asia Pacific region will have the largest share of mobile data traffic in 2021.\nThe trend is driven by the continuing rise of the smartphone. Ericsson claims smartphone subscriptions will overtake non-smartphone ones in the third quarter of 2016. Long-term, dumbphones are essentially dead; by 2021, 95% of all phones in North America will be smartphones.\nCredit: ERicsson\nSo how do we (or, better put, the mobile network operators) cope with these increased traffic demands? Well, one alleviating factor will be the transition to fast 5G networks, which should start to be commercially deployed in 2020, reaching 150 million global subscribers by the end of 2021.\nAnother interesting data point from the report is the rise of Internet of Things devices -- your connected cars, fridges, scales and other similar gizmos -- the number of which will quadruple to 16 billion globally by 2021. That will make this category by far the largest among the connected devices; in fact, IoT gadgets should overtake mobile phones (the current largest category) by 2018.\nOf course, all of these are just predictions, which can be way off in the fast-changing world of smartphones and IoT. Ericsson predicted in 2013 that the number of global mobile subscriptions would reach 9.1 billion by the end of 2018; now, the company says it would take until 2021 for that number to reach 9 billion. Similarly, in last year's Mobility Report, Ericsson predicted the IoT category of devices would number 11 billion by 2020; now, that number is significantly higher, at around 15 billion.\nCheck out the full Ericsson Mobility Report here.\nHave something to add to this story?

        "title": "10 years on, Apple's risky move to Intel Macs is one of its biggest successes",
        "body": "Customers at the Apple Store try out a new MacBook laptop computer July 19, 2006 in San Francisco, California.\nCustomers at the Apple Store try out a new MacBook laptop computer July 19, 2006 in San Francisco, California. Credit: justin sullivan/Getty Images\nNine years ago today, Apple launched the very first iPhone. But the foundation for its success had actually been laid a year earlier. Ten years ago, in the summer of 2006, Apple had just successfully transformed the Mac, completing a transition from using PowerPC chips to Intel chips and essentially transplanting the the \"brains\" of its entire line of personal computers.\nThe transition, which was first announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in 2005, was a big deal. Apple was moving from IBM-built PowerPC processors in its Mac computers to x86 processors made by Intel.\nThe shift was necessitated by the simple fact that IBM\u2019s consumer processors -- especially for laptops -- simply weren\u2019t competitive with the work Intel was doing. PowerPC processors had the potential to be very fast, but they ran hot and required a lot of power, which is bad for laptops. Moreover, IBM was late in delivering chips, and Steve Jobs felt Apple needed better chips sooner to be competitive.\nAnd to be competitive, Apple needed to adopt the same x86 processors that Windows-based PCs had used for two decades.\nSwitching hardware architectures this way wouldn\u2019t be easy.\nBut switching hardware architectures this way wouldn\u2019t be easy. Apps are compiled not just for an operating system, but for a hardware platform. Changing the processor means that not only does the underlying operating system (in 2005, this was Mac OS X) need to be compiled to run on the new processor types, but every app built for the old processor architecture would need to be recompiled, too.\nApple set in its sights a goal of starting the hardware transition (that is, offering Intel-based Mac computers) by June 2006 and finishing by the end of 2007. It turned out, by August 2006, the hardware transition was done, with Apple managing to overhaul its entire consumer Mac line into Intel machines.\nThe fact that the transition succeeded -- and ahead of schedule -- was a huge moment for Apple.\nWhy the move to Intel was a big deal\nMoving from one hardware platform to another isn\u2019t easy. In fact, Apple is the only company that has successfully shifted from one platform to another. Notably, the Intel transition was the second time such a shift occurred.\nIn the mid 1990s, Apple shifted from Motorola 68000 processors to the PowerPC platform. This transition -- though also successful -- was smaller in scope than the transition to Intel.\nJohn Gruber of Daring Fireball, admitted he didn\u2019t think Apple would move to x86 processors, primarily because he was concerned with how Apple could preserve compatibility with existing Mac software. Gruber didn\u2019t think that was possible.\nIt turns out, it was.\nApple developed a piece of technology, aptly called Rosetta, which would act as an translator to convert code built for the PowerPC to run on Intel-based Macs.\nBuilt into Mac OS X Tiger, Rosetta would work in the background, translating the code for a PowerPC app to work on an Intel Mac. The end result was that for many applications, developers wouldn\u2019t need to modify their code at all. It would just work on the new systems.\nCredit: screenshot: apple.com\nOf course, not every PowerPC app would work on Intel. Some apps had codebases just too complex to be automatically translated and emulated for Intel. Notably, Adobe\u2019s Creative Suite 2 was such app. Adobe didn\u2019t release a version of Creative Suite that worked on the Intel Mac until 2007.\nThe bigger challenge was for developers who were trying to build new apps. How could they build apps that would work on an older PowerPC Mac and and Intel Mac.\nThis was a huge concern because, even after fully transitioning to new Intel-based Macs, millions of older PowerPCs were still in the wild. Cutting off those customers from new software was simply not a viable option for many developers. For companies like Adobe and Microsoft with huge swaths of customers on the older platform (and who had publicly committed to supporting Intel Macs), it was very important that Apple offer them a way to serve both sets of users.\nAnd this is where Apple\u2019s transition strategy became particularly brilliant with the advent of universal binaries. A universal binary would mean that an app would be packaged with code that could run on either platform. So if you inserted a CD (remember, this was 2006) or downloaded an app from the web, it would work on your Mac, regardless of whether it was coded for Intel or not.\nApple's universal binary tools wound up being a huge success. I was writing about Mac software after the Intel transition, and it was amazing to see how many developers -- large and small -- quickly migrated to the universal binary format. And even after Apple officially dropped support for the PowerPC with Mac OS X 10.6 (in 2009), there were still some developers who continued to support that platform via universal binaries for years to come.\nGet Mashable Deals delivered to your inbox daily Be the first to know about price drops on Apple products.

At startup, you could choose what operating system you wanted to run.\nFor the first time, users who enjoyed using a Mac at home -- but also had a few Windows-only apps they needed to use -- could use one machine.\nCredit: apple\nAnd the rise of Boot Camp led to virtualization programs such as Parallels Desktop for Mac (first released in 2006) and VMWare Fusion (first released in 2007), which would allow users to run Mac and Windows apps side by side, without a noticeable impact on performance.\nThanks to the iPod, Mac usage was on the rise. But by moving to Intel and gaining support for Windows via Boot Camp or a virtualization program, millions of people who wanted a Mac -- but couldn\u2019t commit to giving up Windows -- could finally have both.\nRise of the MacBook\nNowhere was this more evident than with the MacBook: the 13.3-inch Intel notebook Apple first released in May 2006.\nThe MacBook wasn\u2019t the first Intel-based Mac (an Intel iMac as well as 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pros were released in early 2006), but it was the most important.\nA successor to the iBook, the MacBook was the first modern Mac aimed at the masses. Plus, it was hot.\nCredit: apple\nAvailable in black or white, the design was a departure from the iBook of old. It was sleeker, had a wide screen, and it had attitude.\nThe MacBook was arguably better than a Windows machine because it could run both Mac and Windows apps.\nMoreover, with a starting price of $1,099 and a Core Duo processor, the original MacBook was actually competitively priced when stacked against Windows machines with similar specs.\nMoreover, the MacBook was arguably better than a standard Windows machine because it could run both Mac and Windows apps.\nI watched my own college campus transform from Windows laptops to a sea of MacBooks between 2006 and 2007. For under $1,500, students could get a powerful laptop that would do everything they wanted -- and could still run Windows when absolutely necessary.\nThe MacBook launch also coincided with the \u2018Get a Mac\u2019 campaign. For four years, \u201cI\u2019m a Mac and I\u2019m a PC\u201d became an advertising staple and helped sell millions of Macs.\nI\u2019d even argue that the success of the MacBook -- and Intel Macs in general -- helped excite the general public about what would be Apple\u2019s most important product: the iPhone.\nWhen the iPhone was announced in January 2007, the Intel transition had only been complete for a few months. And although many people had become re-acquainted with Apple thanks to the iPod, the resurgence of Mac popularity only helped make the product that much more desirable.\nThe Mac, as a platform, had a huge renaissance after the Intel transition, too. There were already tons of indie developers building apps for the Mac, but the success of the Intel Mac out of the gate helped create a market for fantastic first-party Mac apps.\nGames notwithstanding, plenty of companies now build apps for the Mac first (Evernote, 1Password, Sketch and Pixelmator, to name a few) and put Windows second (if at all). Moreover, the move to web-based apps made the distinction between operating systems less important than ever.\nTen years on\nTen years ago, if you walked into an office, a university or the average person\u2019s home, you were probably met by a PC.\nThe Mac, as a platform, had a huge renaissance after the Intel transition.\nToday, that\u2019s just not the case. Look at any Starbucks, school or startup office and you\u2019re greeted by Macs.\nThe MacBook Air, which basically became the successor for the first Intel MacBook, has inarguably defined what a modern laptop looks like. The new MacBook is already starting to have a similar impact.\nWindows still far outsells the Mac -- Chromebooks now outsell Macs too -- but the Mac has made a remarkable comeback. And for Apple, Mac users tend to be loyal to the whole ecosystem. They buy iPad tablets and iPhone devices. They buy the Apple Watch.\nAnd none of that would have happened without the transition to Intel x86. The hardware wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep up \u2013 but more importantly, having that ability to run Windows -- just in case -- helped give consumers and business users the reassurance that worst case, they could still run Microsoft stuff, too.\nCredit: luke leonard/mashable\nWhen I look back at how well the Intel transition was handled, it\u2019s also important to think about how it could have gone wrong.\nWhen Windows 8 was released, Microsoft attempted to bring parts of its operating system to the ARM processor using a new operating system, Windows RT. Windows RT was a disaster.\nMicrosoft didn\u2019t create a Rosetta-like layer to bring existing x86 Windows apps to Windows RT. Instead, it required developers to build in code that would run both places (similar to universal binaries). The problem was, there was never a big enough investment from Microsoft (or more importantly, its hardware partners) for developers to bother switching their coding practices.\nIn fact, Microsoft is still trying to transition developers to build Universal Windows Apps. This time, the goal isn\u2019t to have people build apps for the ARM-based Windows RT platform, but for ARM-based phones running Windows 10.\nAnd to see Microsoft struggle to get its developers to adopt Universal Windows Apps (along with the total collapse of the Windows RT platform) simply underscores just how amazing it is that Mac OS X transitioned quickly and with few battle scars.\nFor a few years, there has been speculation that Apple would transition its desktop operating system to ARM. The release of the Intel Core M-based MacBook dispelled many of those rumors, but the truth is that iOS and macOS have the same kernel and now share much of the same code.\nA transition for most developers from x86 to ARM would probably require less work than the transition from PowerPC to Intel -- if only because of the changes made in software development and tooling.\nI\u2019m not convinced we\u2019ll see an ARM-based Mac anytime soon, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it happened at some point in the future. Moreover, if Apple were to transition processing platforms again, I\u2019m even more convinced it would succeed.\nHave something to add to this story? Share it in the comments.",

        "body": "Apple revealed a slew of new software features for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and desktop computers on Monday \u2013 yet omitted an important new technology that will better protect customers\u2019 private data stored on Apple devices.\nApple File System, or APFS, is a new version of the technology Apple\u2019s products use to save and retrieve information, and improves the way information is organized and protected to make it faster and more secure.\nThe new feature is just the latest move towards more widespread encryption in consumer technology products following Apple\u2019s standoff with the FBI earlier in 2016, in which it refused to help the agency weaken its own security processes to access information on an iPhone belonging to a terrorist. Facebook and Google both pledged support for Apple during the fight, and both are subsequently reported to be planning encrypted versions of their messaging apps. WhatsApp went first, opting to fully encrypt all conversations by default.\nAs part of the new system, developers building software for Apple\u2019s devices will be able to opt for users\u2019 information to have no encryption, single-key encryption, or multi-key encryption \u201cwith per-file keys for file data and a separate key for sensitive metadata\u201d \u2013 comparable to leaving a door unlocked, using one key, or using two keys.\nIn its documentation of APFS, Apple explains that full disk encryption has been available on OS X since version 10.7 Lion. APFS differs in that it encrypts files individually rather than as a one unit, similar to other encryption mechanisms Apple introduced to its iOS platform in 2010. It also encrypts related metadata \u2013 the basic summary attached to each file \u2013 and will keen data secure even when the device has been physically hacked.\nSince its battle with the FBI, Apple has made a number of important changes to increase security and tighten encryption. Apple itself couldn\u2019t decrypt information the agency demanded, but the company did have the keys to access information stored in the shooter\u2019s iCloud account. The company is now reportedly considering a system that wouldn\u2019t allow it to access iCloud data.\nDemonstrators display iPads with messages against FBI\u2019s proposals to weaken data security on their screens, outside an Apple store in Boston in February 2016. Photograph: Steven Senne/AP\nMany of the features announced at WWDC expand security of user data, something Apple has been keen to promote as \u201cprotecting user privacy\u201d. Safeguards include running artificial intelligence on the device itself, rather thanin the cloud, and using a technology called \u201cdifferential privacy,\u201d which anonymizes data Apple does collect from its customers.\nThose features focus on protecting data in transit, yet APFS is more like a bank vault on a device that secures information even if someone gains physical access to their computer, phone, tablet, watch or Apple TV.\nApple declined to comment on the new feature.\nACLU staff technologist Daniel Kahn Gillmor said that the expansion of AFPS is likely to have been prioritised after Apple\u2019s spat with the FBI. \u201cProtecting the privacy of user data is one of the critical tasks of modern computing hardware and software. If Apple didn\u2019t offer powerful encryption features for their filesystems, they\u2019d be remiss.\u201d\nWhen Amazon removed full-disk encryption from the Fire OS software used by its Kindle Fire tablets, one security analyst described how the company was \u201cchastised by the marketplace\u201d. Encrypting data is resource-intensive, and Amazon had apparently decided to ditch encryption in favour of improving speed and memory. It later backtracked and reinstated encryption.\nApple seems intent on avoiding similar controversy.\nYet Gillmor says encryption should be switched on by default, rather than being optional, in newer versions of Apple\u2019s macOS desktop software. \u201cMost people don\u2019t deviate from the vendor-supplied defaults,\u201d he says. Gillmor also cautions that APFS hasn\u2019t been finalised and he isn\u2019t sure Apple has any plans to make underlying code available for public scrutiny, a practice common among the security community. There are good reasons to care about the impact of APFS. Stronger encryption doesn\u2019t just keep information from law enforcement agencies \u2013 it also protects people from hackers who might try to grab their data by breaking into a device, whether by stealing it or by poking around a carelessly discarded hard drive. That might not be as exciting as the ability to finally remove the Stocks app from your home screen, but it\u2019s still something.",

        "title": "Florida Man Sues Apple for $10+ Billion, Says iOS Devices Copy His 1992 Drawings",
        "body": "Florida resident Thomas S. Ross has filed a lawsuit against Apple this week, claiming that the iPhone, iPad, and iPod infringe upon his 1992 invention of a hand-drawn \"Electronic Reading Device\" (ERD). The court filing claims the plaintiff was \"first to file a device so designed and aggregated,\" nearly 15 years before the first iPhone.\nBetween May 23, 1992 and September 10, 1992, Ross designed three hand-drawn technical drawings of the device, primarily consisting of flat rectangular panels with rounded corners that \"embodied a fusion of design and function in a way that never existed prior to 1992.\"\nWhat Ross contemplated, was a device that could allow one to read stories, novels, news articles, as well as look at pictures, watch video presentations, or even movies, on a flat touch-screen that was back-lit. He further imagined that it could include communication functions, such as a phone and a modem, input/output capability, so as to allow the user to write notes, and be capable of storing reading and writing material utilizing internal and external storage media. He also imagined that the device would have batteries and even be equipped with solar panels.\nRoss applied for a utility patent to protect his invention in November 1992, but the application was declared abandoned in April 1995 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office after he failed to pay the required application fees. He also filed to copyright his technical drawings with the U.S. Copyright Office in 2014.\nWhile the plaintiff claims that he continues to experience \"great and irreparable injury that cannot fully be compensated or measured in money,\" he has demanded a jury trial and is seeking restitution no less than $10 billion and a royalty of up to 1.5% on Apple's worldwide sales of infringing devices.\nRoss v. Apple, Inc. was filed with the Florida Southern District Court on June 27. The case number is 0:2016cv61471.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nApple Stores are beginning to remove the 13-inch non-Retina MacBook Pro from their showfloors, in what may be a sign the company is preparing to completely phase out the product with a spinning optical disc drive, AppleInsider discovered on Monday.\nWhile the computer is still largely in stock and available to buy, some stores are no longer putting it out for shoppers to try in person, according to a tip received by AppleInsider and confirmed with follow-up checks with several Apple Stores around the U.S.\nA clerk at an Austin location notably said that their store had pulled non-Retina units from the showfloor just last week, and that other stores were doing the same.\nA phase-out would make sense, as the company last updated the computer in 2012, reserving future upgrades for Retina models. In fact all of Apple's major products now have Retina displays, with the exception of the MacBook Air.\nAccordingly the company has marginalized the non-Retina Pro in sales and marketing. It sits at the bottom of Apple's store page for the Pro, and isn't even mentioned on the main product page. In the course of research, a clerk at a New York City Apple Store steered AppleInsider towards buying a Retina model, arguing that the non-Retina system would quickly become outdated, and that a refurbished Retina would make more sense when trying to save money.",

        "title": "iPhone 7 now seems likely to come in Space Black to match Apple Watch, as other rumors emerge",
        "body": "While a previous Macotakara report suggested that the iPhone 7 would be available in a deep blue color, replacing Space Gray, the blog is now suggesting that this is not the *case*.\nI have heard another information that space grey would not be disconnected, but would be possibly updated to much darker color. Also, the new color would not be deep blue, but possibly formal black which is close to black.\nThis tallies with something heard from one of our own sources \u2026\nWe\u2019ve been told that the iPhone 7 will be available in \u2018a new Space Black finish, similar to the Apple Watch.\u2019\nThat source also claims that the Home button \u2013 still a physical one in this generation \u2013 will feature haptic feedback to simulate a click, using the same approach as Force Touch. This is consistent with a much earlier report suggesting a non-moving button. For that to be the case, Apple could need to use a different physical button for a reset, perhaps one of the volume buttons.\nFar more sketchy: The Apple Watch 2 is said to include GPS for accurate workout logging without the need to carry an iPhone, and the Workout app reportedly will gain the ability to track swimming \u2013 suggesting a higher level of waterproofing in the next Apple Watch.\nOn the MacBook Pro front, the rumored OLED touchscreen bar is said to be accompanied by a Touch ID sensor for fingerprint login. We already know that macOS Sierra offers Auto Unlock when a Mac is in proximity to your Apple Watch, reducing the need for Touch ID on the Mac, but this would still be a useful feature for Mac owners without an Apple Watch. That source says the Touch ID sensor will be combined with the power button, which would certainly make sense.\nFinally, we\u2019re hearing again that Apple is working on its own fully wireless EarPods, along the lines of the Bragi Dash. That Apple would offer its own wireless EarPods to coincide with the launch of an iPhone with no headphone socket is again a logical expectation, and the fully-wireless approach pioneered by Bragi would seem an Apple-like approach.\nThe iPhone 7 in Space Black, then, seems to be a likely bet. The other whispers we\u2019re categorizing for now merely as logical-sounding possibilities.\nYou can catch up on all the latest iPhone 7 rumors at our new iPhone 7 guide, scrolling down for the individual stories.",

        "title": "Apple Patents Water-Resistant Speaker Port and Bone Conducting Earphones",
        "body": "Following the release of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, industry sources claimed the next-generation iPhone would be waterproof. A recently granted Apple patent has just given us another reason to believe Apple could walk this path.\nThe US Patent and Trademark Office granted Apple US Patent No. 9,363,589 for a \u201cLiquid resistant acoustic device\u201d, which describes an audio port protected by a specialized mesh \u201cumbrella\u201d or other structure that resists the entry of liquid. As noted by AppleInsider, this system seems to match that of the one introduced with the Apple Watch, which isn\u2019t waterproof but is water resistant.\nHere is how the patented \u201cmesh\u201d umbrella works:\nThe acoustic module is coupled to its host device by an o-ring or similar mechanism, thus creating a tight seal. When liquid passes through the housing apertures it makes contact with the protective mesh umbrella and is directed away. This flow might reduce pressure on the mesh layer, thereby lowering the potential for damage. Apple notes the mesh may in some configurations be allowed to pass a certain amount of liquid at significant pressure to avoid structural harm.\nWhile the rumour mill suggests the iPhone 7 could be waterproof, it is still unclear whether Apple will add this patented feature to the device when it launches this fall.\nAnother patent for \u201cSystem and method of mixing accelerometer and microphone signals to improve voice quality in a mobile device\u201d, discovered by AppleInsider, describes a headset that relies on bone conduction technology to filter out ambient noise.\nAs the patent abstract summarizes, the accelerometer built into the earbuds is able to detect the vibration of the user\u2019s vocal cords filtered by the vocal tract based on vibration in the bones and tissue of the user\u2019s head. Combined with an onboard microphone, the patented system is able to measure output signals and parse out ambient noise.\nOutput from both the accelerometer-based voice activity detector and the microphone that monitors acoustic signals for a user\u2019s voice are compared and run through noise-cancellation processing to output a clean signal for transmission.",

In a post on the WebKit blog, Apple engineer Ricky Mondello has revealed that the company is deactivating Adobe Flash by default on Safari 10. That's the version of the browser shipping with macOS Sierra this fall.\nIf you access a website that has both Flash and HTML5, the browser will opt for the latter. But if the page requires Flash to work, then a prompt will pop up asking if you'd like to switch it on. You can choose to active it just for that session or to keep it on for that URL forever. If you'll recall, Microsoft and Google have been distancing themselves from Flash for quite some time, as well. Edge only displays Flash if it's a central element on the page you're looking at (say, a game or a video), while Chrome has started blocking Flash ads late last year.\nOn the mobile side of things, Apple has announced at WWDC that it's requiring all iOS apps to connect to the internet via HTTPS by January 1st, 2017. That means developers have to switch on a feature Cupertino launched with iOS 9 called App Transport Security.

        "title": "Apple has officially discontinued the Thunderbolt Display.",
        "body": "Earlier this year, we reported that Apple was planning a new Thunderbolt Display with a built-in GPU to replace the outdated current-gen Thunderbolt display. Now, according to TechCrunch, Apple has announced that it is officially discontinuing the Thunderbolt Display.\nIn a statement, an Apple spokesperson explained that the Thunderbolt Display will be available from Apple\u2019s Online Store and in retail locations while supplies last, but once stock has run out, it will not be replenished. Apple also noted that a variety of third-party options are available for Mac users:\n\u201cWe\u2019re discontinuing the Apple Thunderbolt Display. It will be available through Apple.com, Apple\u2019s retail stores and Apple Authorized Resellers while supplies last. There are a number of great third-party options available for Mac users,\u201d said an Apple spokesperson.\nApple\u2019s Thunderbolt Display has been criticized for being considerably overpriced and outdated, not having been updated since 2011. The display offers a 2560\u00d71440 resolution, while the 5K iMac that includes an actual computer inside comes in at $800 more.\nWe noted last month that supply of the Thunderbolt Display had already become limited, perhaps hinting at an impending refresh. While we then exclusively reported that Apple is readying a new Thunderbolt Display with a 5K resolution and built-in GPU. Additionally, the display is expected to feature connection via a USB-C port over Thunderbolt 3.\nWhile some are speculating that Apple pointing users towards third-party options means the company is getting out of the display business altogether, it\u2019s more likely that it\u2019s abandoning the \u201cThunderbolt Display\u201d name. The display announced this fall could carry a name like \u201cApple 5K Display.\u201d\nThough timing was somewhat unclear at the time, now that Apple has formally discontinued the current-gen Thunderbolt Display, it seems likely that we will see a new model sooner rather than later. Perhaps alongside the updated MacBook Pro lineup slated to be launched sometime in the fall.\nApple 5K Display seems like the best guess name to replace the discontinued 'Thunderbolt Display' brand. \u2014 Benjamin Mayo (@bzamayo) June 23, 2016",

        "title": "Apple confirms iOS 10 kernel code left unencrypted intentionally",
        "body": "When Apple released a preview version of iOS 10 at its annual developers conference last week, the company slipped in a surprise for security researchers \u2014 it left the core of its operating system, the kernel, unencrypted.\n\u201cThe kernel cache doesn\u2019t contain any user info, and by unencrypting it we\u2019re able to optimize the operating system\u2019s performance without compromising security,\u201d an Apple spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nApple has kept the inner workings of the kernel obfuscated by encryption in previous versions of iOS, leaving developers and researchers in the dark. The kernel manages security and limits the ways applications on an iPhone or iPad can access the hardware of the device, making it a crucial part of the operating system.\nAlthough encryption is often thought to be synonymous with security, the lack of encryption in this case doesn\u2019t mean that devices running iOS 10 are less secure. It just means that that researchers and developers can poke around in the kernel\u2019s code for the first time, and any security flaws will come to light more quickly. If flaws are revealed, they can be quickly patched.\nLeaving the kernel unencrypted is a rare move of transparency for Apple. The company is so notoriously secretive about its products that some security experts speculated in the MIT Technology Review that the lack of encryption in the kernel was accidental. But such a mistake would be so shocking as to be practically unbelievable, researchers said. \u201cThis would have been an incredibly glaring oversight, like forgetting to put doors on an elevator,\u201d iOS security expert Jonathan Zdziarski told the MIT Technology Review.\nApple has begun to shift towards greater transparency, particularly on security issues, in the wake of its battle with the FBI over unlocking an iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter. When the FBI attempted to compel Apple to unlock the phone, CEO Tim Cook penned a rare open letter to Apple\u2019s customers, explaining his decision to resist. \u201cWe feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government,\u201d Cook wrote. (The FBI eventually dropped its request after paying a third party to break into the device.)\nOpening up the kernel\u2019s code for inspection could weaken the market for security flaws like the one the FBI is presumed to have used to get into the San Bernardino iPhone. If flaws are revealed quickly and widely, it will reduce the prices law enforcement and black markets will pay for them \u2014 and it could mean quicker fixes for Apple\u2019s customers.",

        "title": "Latest hint at \u2018macOS\u2019 rebranding of OS X appears in new App Store guidelines",
        "body": "[UPDATE: Apple has changed the webpage to say Mac OS X, not macOS.]\nIt\u2019s widely expected at this point that Apple will rebrand Mac OS X to simply \u2018macOS\u2019 next week at WWDC, but hidden in today\u2019s announcements regarding the App Store was yet another hint at the change. In a FAQ from on the iTunes Connect website, Apple mistakenly refers to Mac OS X as \u2018macOS,\u2019 again prematurely hinting at the change.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Apple has mistakenly referred to Mac OS X as macOS. Originally in March, we discovered a framework in OS X 10.11.4 that referred to the operating system as macOS. The following month, Apple launched a new environmental webpage on which it referred to the operating system as MacOS.\nThere\u2019s still some uncertainty as to whether the rebrand will be to MacOS or macOS, but at this point we\u2019ve seen two leaks that use the latter and only one that uses the former. Although while iOS, tvOS, and watchOS all use lowercase letters, the difference could be that Mac is a proper noun while \u2018tv\u2019 and \u2018watch\u2019 technically aren\u2019t without the Apple stuck in front of them.\nNevertheless, it makes sense that Apple would rebrand Mac OS X to macOS. It makes the Mac fit in line with the rest of Apple\u2019s software lineup and gives it a more concise and understandable name. The fact that the macOS naming was included in today\u2019s newly released App Store guidelines also suggests that perhaps Apple was originally planning on announcing the App Store changes at WWDC next week.\nIt\u2019s likely that Apple will unveil the first version of macOS at WWDC next week. We reported earlier this year that the next major Mac release would include Siri as a tentpole feature, while others have reported some form of Touch ID could also be coming.\nApple is still planning at least one more release under the OS X moniker as it continues to release OS X 10.11.6 developer betas, but after that it\u2019s looking more and more likely that the next release will be macOS or MacOS.\nH/T Rob Hunt",

First party apps have begun appearing in the App Store, hinting at the strong possibility iOS users will be able to uninstall stock iOS apps. It also could potentially mean that users will be able to install and use third-party apps as default apps.\nThis could mean that users will be able to use an app like Gmail or Spark as the default email app. It could also mean that the stock Music app could be replaced by an app like Spotify.\nApps that we see thus far are Weather, Watch, Voice Memos, Videos, Tips, Stocks, Reminders, Podcasts, Notes, Music, Maps, Mail, iTunes Store, FaceTime, Contacts, Compass, Calendar, and Calculator.\nMore details will inevitably be revealed as the rest of the currently ongoing WWDC keynote continues.",
