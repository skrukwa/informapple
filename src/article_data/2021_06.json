        "body": "Android and Windows users will finally be able to join FaceTime calls. During its WWDC keynote, Apple announced that FaceTime is going to be available on the web so users can call in from Android devices and Windows PCs. The video calling service was previously only available on iOS and Mac devices.\nApple is turning FaceTime into a bit more of a Zoom-like video calling service with this update. FaceTime is also going to allow you to grab a link to a scheduled call so that you can share it with people in advance and join in at the right time.\nRelated Apple is building video and music sharing into FaceTime\nA release date wasn\u2019t immediately announced. It sounds like the web features will launch with iOS 15 in the fall.\nApple announced a number of other FaceTime updates coming in iOS 15, too. There\u2019s a new grid view option, a voice isolation feature to improve sound quality, spatial audio support, and the option to blur your background with \u201cportrait mode.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also a major new feature called SharePlay. SharePlay will let a group of people watch or listen to the same thing at once. The feature lets you pull in songs, videos, or share your screen. Some major names are on board to support the feature, including Disney Plus, Hulu, HBO Max, and Twitch. Apple Music and Apple TV Plus support it, too, of course.\nVirtual watch parties became popular during the pandemic, and SharePlay really dives into that. The feature shows Apple hoping to make FaceTime into more of a hangout space and not just a way to make convenient video calls with your relatives.",

        "title": "Apple employees push back against returning to the office in internal letter",
        "body": "Dear Tim and Executive Leadership,\nThank you for your thoughtful considerations on a hybrid approach to returning to office work, and for sharing it with all of us early this week. We appreciate your efforts in navigating what has been undeniably an incredibly difficult time for everyone around the world, and doing so for over one hundred thousand people. We are certain you have more plans than were shared on Wednesday, but are following Apple\u2019s time-honored tradition of only announcing things when they are ready. However, we feel like the current policy is not sufficient in addressing many of our needs, so we want to take some time to explain ourselves.\nThis past year has been an unprecedented challenge for our company; we had to learn how to deliver the same quality of products and services that Apple is known for, all while working almost completely remotely. We did so, achieving another record-setting year. We found a way for everyone to support each other and succeed in a completely new way of working together \u2014 from locations we were able to choose at our own discretion (often at home).\nHowever, we would like to take the opportunity to communicate a growing concern among our colleagues. That Apple\u2019s remote/location-flexible work policy, and the communication around it, have already forced some of our colleagues to quit. Without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, or being a part of Apple. This is a decision none of us take lightly, and a decision many would prefer not to have to make. These concerns are largely what prompted us to advocate for changes to these policies, and data collected will reflect those concerns.\nOver the last year we often felt not just unheard, but at times actively ignored. Messages like, \u2018we know many of you are eager to reconnect in person with your colleagues back in the office,\u2019 with no messaging acknowledging that there are directly contradictory feelings amongst us feels dismissive and invalidating. Not only do many of us already feel well-connected with our colleagues worldwide, but better-connected now than ever. We\u2019ve come to look forward to working as we are now, without the daily need to return to the office. It feels like there is a disconnect between how the executive team thinks about remote / location-flexible work and the lived experiences of many of Apple\u2019s employees.\nFor many of us at Apple, we have succeeded not despite working from home, but in large part because of being able to work outside the office. The last year has felt like we have truly been able to do the best work of our lives for the first time, unconstrained by the challenges that daily commutes to offices and in-person co-located offices themselves inevitably impose; all while still being able to take better care of ourselves and the people around us.\nLooking around the corner, we believe the future of work will be significantly more location and timezone flexible. In fact, we are already a distributed company with offices all over the world and across many different timezones. Apple\u2019s organizational hierarchy lends itself towards offices that often follow the same structure, wherein people in the same organization are more likely to be co-located in an office. At the same time, we strongly encourage cross-functional, cross-organization collaboration, and our organization\u2019s many horizontal teams reflect this. Such collaboration is widely celebrated across our organization, and arguably leads us to our best results \u2014 it\u2019s one of the things that makes Apple, Apple. However, orgs are rarely co-located within walking distance, let alone in the same building, meaning our best collaboration has always required remote communication with teams in other offices and across timezones, since long before the pandemic. We encourage distributed work from our business partners, and we\u2019ve been a remote-communication necessary company for some time, a vision of the future that Steve Jobs himself predicated in an interview from 1990. This may explain how mandatory out-of-office work enabled tearing down cross-functional communication barriers to deliver even better results.\nAlmost all of us have worked fully remote for over a year now, though the experience arguably would have been better less one pandemic. We have developed two major versions of all our operating systems, organized two full WWDCs, introduced numerous new products, transitioned to our own chipsets, and supported our customers with the same level of care as before. We have already piloted location-flexible work the last 15 months under much more extreme conditions and we were very successful in doing so, finding the following benefits of remote and location-flexible work for a large number of our colleagues:\nDiversity and Inclusion in Retention and Hiring\nTearing Down Previously Existing Communication Barriers\nBetter Work Life Balance\nBetter Integration of Existing Remote / Location-Flexible Workers\nReduced Spread of Pathogens\nWe ask for your support in enabling those who want to work remotely / in location-flexible ways to continue to do so, letting everyone figure out which work setup works best for them, their team, and their role \u2014 be it in one of our offices, from home, or a hybrid solution. We are living proof that there is no one-size-fits-all policy for people. For Inclusion and Diversity to work, we have to recognize how different we all are, and with those differences, come different needs and different ways to thrive. We feel that Apple has both the responsibility to recognize these differences, as well as the capability to fully embrace them. Officially enabling individual management chains and individual teams to make decisions that work best for their teams roles, individuals, and needs \u2014 and having that be the official stated policy rather than the rare individual exceptions \u2014 would alleviate the concerns and reservations many of us currently have.\nWe understand that inertia is real and that change is difficult to achieve. The pandemic forcing us to work from home has given us a unique opportunity. Most of the change has already happened, remote/location-flexible work is currently the \u201cnew normal,\u201d we just need to make sure we make the best of it now. We believe that Apple has the ability to be a leader in this realm, not by declaring \u2018everyone just work from home for forever,\u2019 as some other companies have done, but by declaring an official broad paradigm policy, that allows individual leaders to make decisions that will enable their teams to do the best work of their lives. We strongly believe this is the ideal moment to \u201cburn the boats\u201d \u2014 to boldly declare \u2018yes this can be done, and done successfully, because there is no other choice for the future.\u2019\nWe have gathered some of our requests and action items to help continue the conversation and make sure everyone is heard.\nWe are formally requesting that Apple considers remote and location-flexible work decisions to be as autonomous for a team to decide as are hiring decisions.\nWe are formally requesting a company-wide recurring short survey with a clearly structured and transparent communication / feedback process at the company-wide level, organization-wide level, and team-wide level, covering topics listed below.\nWe are formally requesting a question about employee churn due to remote work be added to exit interviews.\nWe are formally requesting a transparent, clear plan of action to accommodate disabilities via onsite, offsite, remote, hybrid, or otherwise location-flexible work.\nWe are formally requesting insight into the environmental impact of returning to onsite in-person work, and how permanent remote-and-location-flexibility could offset that impact.\nWe have great respect for Apple and its leadership; we strongly believe in the Innovation and Thinking Differently (from \u201cthe way things have always been done\u201d and \u201cindustry standards\u201d) that are part of Apple\u2019s DNA. We all wish to continue to \u201cbleed six colors\u201d at Apple itself and not elsewhere. At Apple, our most important resource, our soul, is our people, and we believe that ensuring we are all heard, represented, and validated is how we continue to defend and protect that precious sentiment.",

        "title": "The six-year-old iPhone 6S and 6S Plus will get iOS 15, and that rules",
        "body": "The iPhone 6S will turn six years old this September, an eternity in phone years. If you\u2019ve managed to hold onto one this long, then Apple has some good news for you \u2014 your phone will be eligible for the iOS 15 upgrade when it arrives for the public this fall. The iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, and first-generation iPhone SE, which all shipped with iOS 9, will be among the oldest devices to receive the OS update.\nSix years is an awfully long life span for a mobile device, and certainly puts the 6S in the running for the longest supported phone to date. The iPhone 5S was five years old when it got its last OS update with iOS 12 but wasn\u2019t eligible for iOS 13. On the Android side, Samsung has made recent moves to improve its device longevity by offering four years of security support for some of its phones. But six years of OS updates and security support puts the 6S in an entirely different league.\nTo be sure, there are a lot of new features that won\u2019t work with the 6S\u2019s A9 Bionic processor. Features like the Google Lens-esque Visual Lookup, Live Text in photos, portrait mode in FaceTime, and immersive walking directions in Maps won\u2019t be available to 6S users, since they all require a device with an A12 Bionic chip a la the XS and XR or later.\nIt\u2019s also possible that newer software will slow down an older phone with an aging, less nimble processor. That might not necessarily be the case, though \u2014 both Ars Technica and Macworld found no significant impact on performance running iOS 14 on the 6S.\nWhat may be a bigger issue, as both testers noted, is that the 6S shows its age with poor battery life. Features like widgets are also tougher to use on the phone\u2019s 4.7-inch screen, which is quaint compared to today\u2019s standard six-inch-plus panels. These aren\u2019t so much compatibility issues as the inevitable, slow march of time that no gadget can escape.",

It's worth noting, again, that this feature will be available to all users, despite some speculation that YouTube may have limited picture-in-picture support for only paying subscribers.\nPicture-in-Picture (PiP) allows users to watch YouTube videos in a small mini player while simultaneously browsing outside of the YouTube app on their mobile device. We\u2019re starting to roll out PiP for YouTube Premium members on iOS and plan to launch PiP for all US iOS users as well.\nYouTube picture-in-picture has been a constant back and forth game, with it sometimes working via the YouTube website on Safari.

        "body": "Apple employees are being asked to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Tim Cook sent out an email Wednesday informing staff of the change.\n\u201cFor all that we\u2019ve been able to achieve while many of us have been separated, the truth is that there has been something essential missing from this past year: each other,\u201d he said. \u201cVideo conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate.\u201d\nCook said that most employees will be asked to come in to the office on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, with the option of working remotely on Wednesdays and Fridays. Teams that need to work in-person will return four to five days a week.\nEmployees also have the chance to work remotely for up to two weeks a year, \u201cto be closer to family and loved ones, find a change of scenery, manage unexpected travel, or a different reason all your own,\u201d according to the letter. Managers need to approve remote work requests.\nThe change is not entirely unexpected for Apple staff. While employees have worked remotely during the coronavirus pandemic, the company famously discouraged working from home prior to 2020. In December, Tim Cook told employees they could be asked to come back to the office as early as June, according to Bloomberg.\nApple\u2019s stance on remote work, while getting more relaxed, is still conservative compared to the other tech giants. In May, Google announced that 20 percent of its workforce would be able to work from home permanently. Mark Zuckerberg has said that remote work \u201cis the future,\u201d and told Facebook employees they can all work from home forever, so long as they get their manager\u2019s approval.\nIn the letter Wednesday, Cook also encouraged all employees to get vaccinated.\n\u201cFor now, let me simply say that I look forward to seeing your faces,\u201d he said in closing. \u201cI know I\u2019m not alone in missing the hum of activity, the energy, creativity and collaboration of our in-person meetings and the sense of community we\u2019ve all built.\u201d",

        "title": "Apple CEO Tim Cook: Sideloading Apps Would 'Destroy the Security' of the iPhone",
        "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook this morning participated in a virtual interview at the VivaTech conference, which is described as Europe's biggest startup and tech event. Cook was interviewed by Guillaume Lacroix, CEO and founder of Brut, a media company that creates short-form video content.\nWe've been focused on privacy for over a decade. We see it as a basic human right. A fundamental human right. And we've been focused on privacy for decades. Steve used to say privacy was stating in plain language what people are signing up for and getting their permission. And that permission should be asked repeatedly. We've always tried to live up to that. [...] If everyone is worried someone else is watching them, they begin to do less, think less. And no one wants to live in a world where freedom of expression narrows. Privacy goes to the heart of just one of the key values of Apple.\nMuch of the discussion centered on privacy, as it often does in interviews that Cook participates in. He reiterated once again how important privacy is to Apple.\nTalk of privacy values led to a discussion of \"GAFA,\" an acronym used in France that lumps Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon together. Cook said he doesn't like that particular acronym because it paints a picture that \"all companies are monolithic in nature,\" and those companies have \"different business models and different values.\"\nIf you look at Apple and look at what we do, we make things. We make hardware, software, and services, and we try to make sure that at that intersection, they work seamlessly together. We focus on making the best, not the most.\nCook was also asked about regulation, specifically in Europe because the event was taking place in France. He commented on the GDPR, and said Apple would support even stronger privacy laws.\nThere's very good regulation coming out of Europe like the GDPR. The GDPR set not only a standard, but really set the stage for the world to adopt GDPR because most of the companies are multinational companies and are implementing this around the world regardless of the regulations in those places. We were big supporters of GDPR from the beginning, and we would support going even further than the GDPR in privacy because there's still so much left to do in the privacy world.\nCook spoke about current regulatory changes that are being discussed in Europe, and would force sideloading on the iPhone. Cook said that such a move would destroy the security of the \u200ciPhone\u200c.\nCurrent Digital Services Act language that is being discussed would force sideloading on the iPhone. This would be an alternate way of getting apps onto the iPhone. As we look at that, that would destroy the security of the iPhone and a lot of the privacy initiatives that we've built into the App Store, where we have privacy nutrition labels and App Tracking Transparency that forces people to get permission to track across apps. These things would not exist anymore, except in people that stuck with our ecosystem, and so I worry deeply about privacy and security. What we're going to do is constructively take part in the debate and hope that we can find a way forward. As I said, there are good parts of the regulation... like there are parts of the DSA that are right on. I think it's just one of those areas where we have the responsibility to say when it's not in the best interest of our user, that it's not.\nCook went on to point out that Android has 47x more malware than iOS. \"Why is that?\" he asked. \"Because we've designed iOS in such a way that there's one App Store and all of the apps are reviewed prior to going on the store.\" Cook said that he's \"optimistic\" about the discussions, and that Apple will be \"standing up for the user.\"\nCook was also asked about how Apple reconciles its environmental goals with shipping a new \u200ciPhone\u200c every year, but he mostly skirted the question with a discussion of Apple's environmental efforts and plans to make the entire supply chain carbon neutral by 2030. \"A great product for the user and a great product for the planet can be one in the same,\" said Cook. \"And that's the objective we set for ourselves.\"\nOn the topic of future technology, Cook was asked about what he expects to see in the \u200ciPhone\u200c 30, 20 years in the future.\nWell, it will be better than the iPhone 12. You can count on that. It will solve more problems for people. At the root of it, what Apple is all about is making the best products that really enrich people's lives. We won't work on one that where we don't feel like we can meet that mission. And so we only do a few things.\nCook said that he's excited about \"so many things\" coming in the future, including AR and AI.\nIn terms of what I'm excited about, I'm excited about so many things. I'm a great believer in the power of technology to help people. We approach the future with great humility because we know we can't predict it. I'm not one of those people that can say I can see 20 years out or 30 years out and tell you what is going to happen. I really don't believe anyone can. We approach it with great humility. I get excited about AR because I see it as technology that can enhance life in a broad way. We've been working on AR first with our iPhones and iPads, and later we'll see where that goes in terms of our products. The key thing is that it can enrich people's lives. I get excited about AI and the ability to remove some of the things that keep people down and do work and free up leisure time for people.\nCook said that he's \"exceedingly optimistic\" about the intersection of technology and health. Apple initially looked at the Apple Watch from a wellness point of view, but then started getting emails from people who had discovered heart problems from the heart rate sensor, which led to Apple adding more health features into the Apple Watch.\nI'm exceedingly optimistic about the intersection of technology and health. when we started shipping the watch we did so with thinking about it from a wellness point of view. but we put a heart rate sensor on it... and I was getting tons of emails from people who found heart problems that they didn't know about. So we started adding more function to the watch.\nCook said that the \"idea of continually monitoring the body\" is a \"big idea that has a long roadmap ahead of it.\"\nCook was asked about Apple's failures, and he says that Apple fails all the time, but tries to do so internally as to not impact customers.\nI fail daily at something. We do allow ourselves to fail. We try to fail internally instead of externally because we don't want to involve customers in the failure, but we develop things and subsequently decide not to ship. We begin going down a certain road and sometimes adjust significantly because of a discovery that we make in that process. And so absolutely, failing is a part of life and it's a part of it whether you're a new company, a startup, or you're a company that's been around awhile and trying different things. If you're not failing, you're not trying enough different things.\nAt the end of the discussion, Cook was asked about the Apple Car, and he of course declined to comment. \"In terms of a car, I've got to keep some secrets,\" Cook said. \"There always has to be something up our sleeve, so I don't think I'll comment on the car rumor.\"\nOther topics of discussion included working through COVID, Apple's efforts to create face shields, disinformation, climate change, taxes, and more, all of which can be found in the full interview.",

        "title": "iPadOS 15 confirms Apple's M1-equipped iPad Pro is a V8 engine powering a Ford Pinto",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nThe hardware on the new iPad Pro is absolutely stellar, far beyond any competition in the tablet space. But, Apple's newly announced iPadOS 15 is so decidedly not-pro that it's fair to question whether the company will ever fully take the training wheels off of its restrictive software.\nFollowing the launch of new iPad Pro models in May, which feature the same blazing fast M1 CPU as Apple's latest Mac systems, many predicted and hoped that the device maker would unveil an overhauled iPadOS at its Worldwide Developers Conference.\nThere remains a lot of low-hanging fruit that the company could have tackled \u2014 features already widely available on both Intel and M1 Macs, including a more robust multitasking system, proper support for external monitors, and greater compatibility with external peripherals.\nWe didn't get any of those.\nInstead, the headline features include:\nNew buttons to invoke the same old multitasking system \u2014 an improvement, but not the overhaul needed\nWidgets that can be placed anywhere on the home screen \u2014 something that launched a year ago on the iPhone\nThe ability to quickly scribble notes while in an app \u2014 something that could previously be done by tapping the lock screen with an Apple Pencil.\nNone of the above improvements are bad, per se, but they just don't go far enough for a device that runs the same processor as the latest Macs \u2014 systems that are blowing away the competition, earning rave reviews from critics, and driving sales of Mac hardware to heights the company has never seen.\nThere is so much powerful hardware in the svelte iPad Pro design, so much untapped potential, that users and developers alike have been clamoring for an overhaul of iPadOS to truly unlock its potential for high-performance users.\nSouped up, but only driving in a school zone\nConsider that the new iPad Pro, for the first time ever, comes with options of 8 or 16 gigabytes of RAM, bringing it even more in line with the Mac. When the M1 iPad Pro went on sale, developers noted that apps were limited to 5 gigabytes of RAM in iPadOS 14, leading to expectations that more power would be made available to developers with iPadOS 15. Yet at this week's WWDC, there has been no indication that developers are being provided the tools they need to take their professional-grade iPad apps to the next level.\nThough it has a USB-4/Thunderbolt 3 port, the new iPad Pro does not offer full support for external monitors. On the home screen and throughout the native operating system, the iPad will simply mirror what is displayed on the iPad. Have a widescreen 16:9 display? Too bad, you get a 4:3 ratio matching what your iPad is already showing you.\nAgain, there is no technical reason for this limitation based on the hardware in the new iPad Pro, or even in the previous-generation models. Every M1 Mac is capable of driving an external display at its native resolution. This shortcoming is simply a limitation of iPadOS, and it's not addressed in the upcoming version 15 upgrade.\nThat USB-4 port is also hobbled when it comes to inputs. Any podcaster who does shows with remote hosts knows if you want to use an external microphone, you'll need at least one app for live communication with the others appearing on the program, and another app to record your local audio at the highest possible quality. This is impossible with iPadOS, including the upcoming version 15, as only one app at a time can tap into incoming audio from an external microphone.\nWhat about pro apps? Developers have been clamoring for Xcode, Apple's integrated software development environment currently limited to macOS, to make the migration over to the iPad. After all, now that the iPad supports keyboards and mouse/trackpad input, there is no real reason to not have Xcode for iPad Pro.\nBut instead of Xcode, Apple essentially gave developers a slap in the face, introducing an improved version of Swift Playgrounds \u2014 an educational tool created to help children learn how to code \u2014 that will allow iPad users to write and submit apps to the App Store. A pro app, Swift Playgrounds is not.\nFinally, multitasking on iPad Pro \u2014 which is to say, displaying two or more apps on the screen simultaneously \u2014 has been a confusing mess for years, to put it charitably. It very clearly needs a reimagining from the ground up.\nInstead, with iPadOS 15, Apple simplified the current system by adding dedicated buttons that will allow users to more easily invoke features like Split View, or making a split app fullscreen once again. Rather than go back to the drawing board and fix the problem with a better, more robust solution worthy of pros who probably use dozens of apps simultaneously, the company simply added a few buttons to the existing system and called it a day.\nWhat exactly is going on?\nWhy is it this way? There are a few possible explanations.\nThe pandemic and remote working has made it challenging for teams of all sizes at all kinds of companies to be as productive and efficient as they once were. It's possible that Apple had grand ambitions for iPadOS this year, but simply wasn't able to meet them because its workers, its corporate culture, and its need to update all of its major platforms and services on an annual basis proved to be too much.\nIt's still baffling that the new iPad Pro has an M1 processor identical to the one found in Macs but lacks basic computing features. One potential explanation for why Apple put the M1 in the iPad might simply be chip consolidation.\nViewed from one angle, with an ongoing chip shortage driven by the pandemic, Apple may have decided it made sense to use one chip to rule them all, making it easier to mass-produce all of its popular devices by relying on the same brains for each model.\nBut from another, more pessimistic view, placing the M1 in the iPad Pro could be a supply chain consolidation tactic for financial reasons, increasing efficiency and thus improving margins to help Apple's bottom line.\nThe third \u2014 and most optimistic \u2014 view on the situation might be that Apple is planning future updates to iPadOS that will take advantage of what the M1 has to offer. This feels possible, but also makes it clear that anyone splurging for a $1800 12.9-inch iPad Pro with 16 gigabytes of RAM is getting hosed for the foreseeable future, in hopes that maybe one day that the software on their super-powered tablet might live up to its hardware potential.\nApple's iPadOS will inevitably continue to mature, and Apple would be foolish not to bring apps like Xcode, Final Cut, Logic and other professional-grade software to its beast of a tablet.\nAfter Apple's WWDC keynote this week, I lamented on Twitter that the iPadOS 15 unveiling was a disappointment. One reader responded that WWDC is meant for developers, not users, and apps like Final Cut and Logic make more sense to unveil in the fall.\nThat wishful thinking may ultimately prove to be true, but it's important to remember that many of the headline features unveiled with iPadOS 15 have very little to do, specifically, with developers.\nSure, widgets placeable anywhere on the home screen will encourage more developers to make widgets \u2014 but those widgets have been a part of iPadOS (relegated to the left side of the screen, or on the search screen) for years. The addition of App Library, ported over from the iPhone, has essentially no consequences for developers. Quick Notes, SharePlay, screen sharing and new Memoji are all features Apple chose to showcase for iPadOS 15, and they have almost nothing to do with developers. WWDC may be a developer-focused show, but the keynote is intended for everyone.\nIf this is it, please let me know\nIt's possible that this is all Apple ever intends for the iPad to be \u2014 a powerful, capable, delightful device with a host of great apps designed for unitasking with occasional multitasking. Those who need to use dual monitors, record a podcast, or edit 4K video with surround sound audio should get a Mac. Macs are pretty good at all of that stuff, and the M1 is great.\nI love my 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and I use it every single day. It's an invaluable tool in my arsenal, and that's why I so desperately want to see it live up to its full potential.\nBut after WWDC 2021 and the iPadOS 15 unveiling, I'm wondering if Apple really ever wants it to live up to that potential. Or maybe they'd rather just sell you a Mac for that stuff.\nIf that's the case, so be it. I'll happily plunk down for a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with 8 gigabytes of RAM, and spend that extra change to put more horsepower into Apple's alternative platform \u2014 one that can actually take advantage of all of the hardware under the hood.\nFollow all the details of WWDC 2021 with the comprehensive AppleInsider coverage of the whole week-long event from June 7 through June 11, including details of all the new launches and updates.",

But the NYT is now reporting that Trump didn\u2019t stop at journalists \u2014 in 2017 and 2018, it forced Apple to cough up metadata on at least two Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee, including current chairman Adam Schiff and representative Eric Swalwell, and as many as a dozen people tied to that committee in total, including family members and at least one child.\nLike the media outlets, Apple was under a gag order and unable to tell anyone until it expired this year \u2014 the only reason we\u2019re learning about this now is because the new administration\u2019s Justice Department decided to reveal the subpoenas and gag orders to the press.\nMetadata is powerful\nWhile one of the NYT\u2019s sources insist that Apple only provided metadata, not photos or the contents of emails, it\u2019s been well-established for years that metadata is data: you can learn a lot if you know where, when, and who a given person is talking to, particularly if you combine that with other insights. (An earlier NYT investigation showed that the amount of location data smartphones already reveal to data brokers is enough to identify someone personally.)\nApple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLast Saturday, the Justice Department promised it would no longer secretly subpeona records from journalists to root out leaks.",

Windows 11 will allow users to run Android apps, but the integration with Windows and iPhone is lacking. In that regard, Nadella says Microsoft would \"love to make sure that it works better,\" referencing the iPhone and Windows.\nThe CEO goes on to say that, like other companies, Apple is welcome to doing anything it wants on Windows, including bringing iMessage to the platform. iMessage has been a hallmark of Apple's devices, and despite the Cupertino tech giant partially opening FaceTime to Android and Windows later this year, iMessage remains an Apple product exclusive.\nAs part of the legal battle between Epic Games and Apple, court filings including internal emails between high-ranking Apple executives revealed that at one point in time, Apple had considered bringing iMessage to Android.\nAccording to the emails, the executives felt that bringing iMessage to a competing platform \"would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.\" While not explicitly stating Windows, Apple bringing iMessage to its largest computer competitor could be a business disadvantage.",

        "body": "Earlier this month, Tim Cook announced in an internal memo that Apple is going to adopt a new hybrid work plan that will require employees to work in-person at least three days a week. While this has resulted in some controversy, the company reaffirmed that it has no plans to go back on its decision, as it considers in-person work \u201cessential.\u201d\nIn an internal video obtained by The Verge, senior VP of retail and people Deirdre O\u2019Brien said that Apple believes that \u201cin-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future.\u201d O\u2019Brien also mentioned that the products and services introduced by Apple in the past have all been the result of in-person collaboration.\n\u201cIf we take a moment to reflect on our unbelievable product launches this past year, the products and the launch execution were built upon the base of years of work that we did when we were all together in-person.\u201d\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple had to close its offices in 2020, which resulted in more than a year of completely remote work. Now that the situation is better in the US, the company wants its employees to return to in-person work, but there\u2019s a group of people who have taken a stand against this decision.\nEmployees have sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook asking the company to let them choose to work in-person or remote, but Apple is denying this request. As mentioned by the report, the company will consider each case individually, but the order now is to return to the office on the hybrid model.\nNow, Apple is essentially denying that request, saying any remote work decisions will be made \u201con a case-by-case basis with any new remote positions requiring executive approval.\u201d\nAlthough a hybrid working model is part of a new, more relaxed approach from Apple, it\u2019s still quite traditional when compared to other companies like Google and Facebook, which let their employees work remotely indefinitely.",

        "body": "Apple iPhones Can Soon Hold Your ID. Privacy Experts Are On Edge\ntoggle caption Apple\nBuying a coffee and grabbing a train is already possible with an iPhone, but Apple wants to replace the physical wallet completely.\nTo that end, earlier this week Apple announced a new feature to let users scan their driver's licenses and save it to their iPhones to use as a legitimate form of identification.\nThe company is working with an undisclosed number of states and the Transportation Security Administration on the plan, which is aimed at speeding up tedious tasks like getting through airport security. It is expected to launch this fall when Apple rolls out its latest iPhone operating system, iOS 15.\nApple touts the feature as an added convenience, though to privacy experts and advocates, it is raising alarm.\n\"This just strikes me as the latest example of where they're trying to weave themselves into more and more aspects of our lives,\" said Evan Greer, director of the group Fight for the Future, a progressive organization critical of Big Tech. \"And when Apple becomes kind of indispensable, it truly is too big to fail.\"\nWhile iPhone users can already store digital copies of their credit cards and make purchases using Apple's Wallet app, some see the digital ID as a bridge too far, inviting greater surveillance and data tracking.`\nElizabeth Renieris, a fellow at Stanford University who studies digital identification systems, said the feature may be easy-to-use and save time. Those conveniences, however, come at a cost: Turning every instance in which we show our ID into a business opportunity.\n\"The sleeker these credentials are, the more they're embedded into things we're always attached to like a mobile device, which we take everywhere, the more there's an incentive to introduce identity requirements in contexts where it never existed before,\" Renieris said. \"We're running a risk where we'll be in a situation where we always have to identify ourselves, and that creates some perverse incentives.\"\nRenieris said a for-profit company like Apple will treat IDs as a way to make money, perhaps one day tacking on transaction fees, as Apple does with purchases made through Apple Wallet.\nApple has not yet publicly revealed its planned business model for Apple ID.\nMichael Veale, a professor at University College London who specializes in technology policy, said the feature will make iPhone users even more reliant on Apple to carry out daily life.\n\"We're really opening Pandora's Box in allowing people to prove things about themselves from the intimate innards of their phone,\" Veale said. \"But this is what Apple wants: to shape how people communicate, collaborate, discuss, buy and sell, and now people's very identities. Apple wants that all within their purview.\"\nA spokeswoman for Apple did not respond to questions about whether the digital ID feature could be used for tracking or as way to make money for the company. Instead, she pointed to an announcement stating that the identity cards will be encrypted and \"safely stored\" on iPhones.\n\"What happens when Apple messes up?\"\nAbout a dozen states and the federal government already are exploring ways to digitize official forms of ID, though experts say Apple's involvement presents a new layer of concerns.\nTo Aram Sinnreich, a professor at American University in Washington who studies technology, it is yet another reason why Congress should pass a law restricting how companies can use online data.\nWhile some states, including California and Virginia, have passed data privacy laws, the U.S. does not have a national law safeguarding Americans' online information.\n\"If there's no regulation holding Apple accountable, then there's nothing stopping them from surveilling us,\" Sinnreich said.\nProponents of digital IDs counter that technology like cryptography allows authorities to verify a digital identity on a mobile phone while preserving the person's identity. Yet some civil rights groups remain vigilant.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union recently released a report highlighting the potential consequences of mobile IDs, including increased tracking and possible abuse by law enforcement.\n\"Given rampant questionable police searches of mobile devices, statutory protections against such searches\u2014already needed\u2014will become even more vital if people's smartphones are to become a central and routine part of interactions with law enforcement,\" according to the report.\nSmartphone accessibility is another issue, since studies show that 40% of people over 65 and about 25% of people who make less than $30,000 do not have a smartphone. According to the ACLU report, if there was ever a legal requirement for a digital ID, that could \"further disadvantage marginalized communities.\"\nAnother fear among data privacy experts: What if Apple's trove of millions of driver's licenses becomes potentially bait for malicious hackers?\nSinnreich admits that Apple has a solid security record. But, he says, data protection systems can fail.\n\"What happens when Apple messes up? What happens when there is a large security breach and 100 million peoples' information gets leaked?\" he said. \"We are stuck with this partner who has violated our trust and we have no legal apparatus to hold them accountable or separate ourselves from them.\"\nEditor's note: Apple is among NPR's financial supporters.",

        "body": "June 21, 2010: Apple releases iOS 4, which introduces a range of productivity features as well as the FaceTime videotelephony service.\niOS 4 represents a big step forward for Apple\u2019s flourishing mobile devices. Due to the arrival of the first-gen iPad earlier in the year, iOS 4 also brings a transition from the mobile operating system\u2019s original name, \u201ciPhone OS.\u201d\niOS 4 release brings important updates to iPhone, iPad\nSteve Jobs first showed off iOS 4 at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference on June 7, 2010, alongside the iPhone 4. The new mobile OS made it exceedingly clear that the iPhone was now a productivity tool in its own right, rather than simply an entertainment device.\niOS 4 ladled on new features, including spell-checking, Bluetooth keyboard compatibility and Home screen backgrounds. Most crucially, however, it brought multitasking to the iPhone for the first time.\nThe update gave users the ability to keep certain apps running in the background while using others (for instance, playing music while reading a website). It also made it easy to skip between different open apps.\nFaceTime, Game Center and iBooks\nIn addition, iOS 4 delivered a host of other neat innovations. These included Home screen folders and a new unified Mail inbox capable of managing different accounts. A new geolocation feature made it easier to sort your images (an early precursor to the AI filtering that arrived in iOS 10).\nApple\u2019s new software for iPhone and iPad also added a zoom mode and tap-to-focus features for the camera, plus web and Wikipedia results in Universal Search.\nHowever, iOS 4\u2019s biggest talking point was the addition of FaceTime. Apple\u2019s proprietary app let iPhone and iPad users communicate in real time using audio and video. FaceTime earned good reviews from most users, but the deaf community in particular embraced the new technology, which worked well with sign language. (Apple emphasized this capability in a FaceTime ad at the time.)\nSome new iOS 4 features proved controversial\nNot everything about Apple\u2019s new mobile OS proved successful, however. It also introduced two controversial new apps: Game Center and iBooks.\nA social network for gamers, Game Center never really caught on. (Apple quietly killed the Game Center app in 2016, although it continues to function as a social gaming network.)\niBooks, meanwhile, showcased Apple\u2019s new excitement about e-books. That ultimately landed the company in hot water after Cupertino colluded with publishers to fix e-book prices.\niOS 4: An important update\nDo you remember iOS 4? What were your thoughts on it?

        "title": "Next-Generation 16-Inch MacBook Pro Seemingly Filed in Regulatory Database Ahead of WWDC",
        "body": "Apple is widely rumored to be planning new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, each with a mini-LED display and an improved iteration of the M1 chip. The notebooks are expected to feature a new design with a flatter top and bottom and more ports, including the return of an HDMI port, SD card slot, and a magnetic power cable. Rumors also suggest the Touch Bar will be retired in favor of physical Fn keys.\nLending further credence to these plans, MacRumors has potentially discovered the next-generation 16-inch MacBook Pro in a Chinese regulatory database. The listing, filed on April 14 by Apple supplier Sunwoda Electronic, is for a battery with an Apple-like model identifier A2527 rated at 8,693 mAh/11.45V. This is similar to the current 16-inch MacBook Pro's battery, which is rated at 8,790 mAh/11.36V, according to iFixit.\nSunwoda Electronic is the same supplier that filed the alleged iPhone 13 battery capacities that were spotted in the same Chinese database earlier this week.\nIf the filing is accurate, the next 16-inch MacBook Pro would have a slightly lower battery capacity than the existing model, potentially due to the notebook's rumored flatter design. However, any potential impact on battery life would likely be mitigated by the 16-inch MacBook Pro transitioning from Intel processors to more power-efficient Apple silicon. In fact, battery life could still end up being longer than the current generation.\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman previously reported that the redesigned MacBook Pro models will be unveiled as early as this summer, with leaker Jon Prosser expecting the MacBook Pro announcement to be part of WWDC next week. Some other sources have suggested the new MacBook Pro models will not be announced until the second half of 2021.\nWWDC kicks off with Apple's Keynote on Monday, June 7 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.\nUpdate 9:45 a.m.: We've also found an entry for what seems likely to be the upcoming 14-inch MacBook Pro.\nThe listing for this battery, also from Sunwoda, was filed on March 30 and carries model identifier A2519. The battery is rated for 6,068 mAh at 11.47V. That's a bit higher than the 5,103 mAh rating of the current 13-inch MacBook Pro, but the redesigned chassis for the larger 14-inch display size will likely leave room for a larger battery. We saw a similar increase in battery capacity for the larger MacBook Pro when it moved from 15 inches to 16 inches.",

However, no formal bill has been signed on that front.\nThe report says that automative integrated circuits and Apple chip orders are getting TSMC\u2019s primary attention, then followed by orders from PC and server manufacturers. TSMC is Apple\u2019s exclusive manufacturer of the A-series chips that go into iPhone and iPad devices, as well as the M-series chips that are used in Apple Silicon Macs.\nFor the iPhone 13, TSMC is manufacturing the new Apple-designed A15-chip on a 5-nanometer fabrication process.\nDue to Apple\u2019s scale, it can negotiate preferable terms such that its orders are satisfied first. So far, it looks like Apple will be able to successfully ramp production of the iPhone 13 series, ready for a public release in September/October. In contrast, smaller smartphone manufacturers have been impacted by the global shortages.\nWith the launch of the new iPhone in the fall, securing chip supply in the third quarter is a major focus for Apple. Earlier this year, Apple said the chip shortage was limiting production of iPad and MacBook models.\nOn its last quarterly earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was struggling to get high quantities of chips of \u2018legacy nodes\u2019, in essence suggesting that Apple\u2019s premium SoC chip orders with TSMC will not be meaningfully affected.",

        "body": "If you\u2019ve been online at all in the past two years, you\u2019ve probably seen a panel or two from Nathan Pyle\u2019s quirky alien-centric webcomic, Strange Planet. And now, Apple TV+ has plans to turn it into an animated series.\nThe adorable series features large-eyed blue aliens who provide banal commentary about daily life on an Earth-like planet. The comic covers all kinds of topics and scenarios, from making coffee and playing hockey, to cats and friends competing against each other in video games. With its lighthearted take on human life, it\u2019s no wonder that the comic has amassed over six million followers on Instagram, or that Apple wants to turn it into a show.\nNathan Pyle\u2018s fun and colorful art style and witty writing will easily translate into adult animated goodness. And with Rick and Morty\u2018s and Community\u2018s Dan Harmon on board, it should be a home run. Both Pyle and Harmon will serve as the show\u2019s executive producers, and Apple\u2019s Studios subsidiary will produce it along with animation studio ShadowMachine, which worked on BoJack Horseman. Strange Planet will be Apple\u2019s second animation venture, following Central Park, which was created by Loren Bouchard of Bob\u2019s Burgers fame.\nThough we don\u2019t yet have a release date for the show, we do know that the first season will include 10 episodes. Until we get more information, though, you can get your little-blue-alien fill by checking out the official Instagram page for Strange Planet or buying one of the many books in the series.",

        "title": "Apple reportedly explored setting up primary care clinics, with Apple Watch relaying health data to Apple doctors - 9to5Mac",
        "body": "According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Apple had considered setting up an in-house medical service that would offer primary care clinics with doctors employed by Apple. The Journal says the company was exploring how the Apple Watch could be used to improve healthcare.\nThis project was envisioned in 2016 but has seemingly been put on pause, partly because Apple\u2019s dogfooding of a similar project for its own employees saw limited use.\nApple COO Jeff Williams had apparently tasked his team with coming up of ways to disrupt the traditional health industry, where patients only see doctors when something goes wrong.\nThe tabled plan was to offer a subscription health service that would combine virtual and in-person care provided by Apple doctors, enhanced with continuous health monitoring by the customer\u2019s Apple Watch and iPhone.\nAccording to the report, Apple used employee health clinics near Apple Park as a test bed for the scheme. However, the project has not advanced much in the intervening years. The Journal says some employees have criticized the accuracy of the data being collected at the employee clinics.\nThe Journal cites one anecdote from an internal meeting.\nEmployees concerned about the culture pointed to a 2019 meeting during which a midlevel manager raised questions about data, according to people familiar with the meeting and the documents. Dr. Desai responded angrily, leading some present to conclude that critical questions were unwelcome, according to the people and the documents. The manager left Apple weeks later and the episode contributed to her departure, documents show. Apple\u2019s spokesman said Dr. Desai spoke to the importance of data integrity in the meeting. \u201cThis matter was investigated thoroughly and the allegations could not be substantiated,\u201d the spokesman said. Apple declined to comment on the circumstances of the employee\u2019s departure.\nIn response to the piece, an Apple representative said that many of the claims are \u201cbased on incomplete, outdated and inaccurate information.\u201d\nSo far, Apple has contributed to the health space through sensors and data tracking via its devices. The company has popularized heart rate monitoring, fall detection, and ECG features via the Apple Watch. It collates health and fitness metrics through the HealthKit database, which users can review through the Health app on iPhone and Apple Watch.\nAt WWDC, Apple announced a new \u201cwalking steadiness\u201d measurement and the ability to share health data directly with partnered doctors. The Health app in iOS 15 also automatically notifies users about dramatic changes in long-term trends of their health data.",

        "title": "Mac sales in India tripled after online Apple Store opened",
        "body": "Mac sales in India more than tripled year-on-year after Apple was finally allowed to open an online store in the country.\nThat made Apple the fifth-largest PC brand in the country as of the first quarter of 2021 \u2026\nDigitimes reports.\nApple became the fifth largest PC brand in India in the first quarter of 2021, with shipments of desktops, notebooks, tablets and workstations combined to reach 208,000 units, according to data from Canalys. Canalys pointed out that the significant increase in Apple\u2019s notebook and tablet shipments in India was due mainly to Apple opening its online store in September 2020. Research firm IDC\u2019s figures also show Apple\u2019s PC shipments in India (excluding tablets) grew 335.5% on year in the first quarter and only lagged Asustek\u2019s by around 2,000 units. Apple and Asustek were tied for fifth place in IDC\u2019s rankings for PC brands in India in the quarter. CMR\u2019s figures also showed that India\u2019s tablet shipments went down 34% sequentially in the first quarter of 2021, while Apple was the second largest tablet brand in the country with a 29% market share. Apple its tablet shipments increase 144% on year, surpassing the original second-place Samsung Electronics. Of the 29% market share, 17pp came from iPad 8, and 9pp from iPad Air 2020.\nApple had for many years wanted to open an online store in India, but the law prevented it from doing so. Foreign companies wanting to run own-brand e-commerce sites were required to source 30% of their production locally, something Apple was unable to do. However, a boost in iPhone production in the country helped persuade the government to ease the requirements.\nApple\u2019s online store in India opened in September of last year, with physical stores to follow.\nApple SVP of Retail + People Deirdre O\u2019Brien noted the expansion: \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be expanding in India and want to do all we can to support our customers and their communities. We know our users are relying on technology to stay connected, engage in learning, and tap into their creativity, and by bringing the Apple Store online to India, we are offering our customers the very best of Apple at this important time.\u201d In May, build-to-order Mac sales opened through resellers in India ahead of the official online store launch. Tim Cook had promised in February that the online store would open this year. Physical Apple Stores in India will arrive in 2021, with one of the first locations expected to be built in Mumbai\u2019s Bandra Kurla Complex.",

        "body": "Before WWDC, rumors largely driven by leaker Jon Prosser suggested that Apple would announce redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros during the conference. Those rumors, however, did not come to fruition. Interestingly, though, Apple lists \"m1x MacBook Pro\" as a tag for the WWDC keynote uploaded on YouTube.\nThe tag, first spotted by Apple YouTuber Max Balzer on Twitter, is among other tags Apple has added to the video, including iOS 15, M1X, iOS, developers conference, and more. Apple released the M1 Apple silicon chip in November, and speculation has suggested that the next chip, expected in the redesigned MacBook Pros, would be called \"m1x.\"\nThe inclusion of the tag, while not totally indicative, may suggest that Apple does plan to call the upcoming chip \"m1x,\" or, more likely, is simply using the rumor mill as a way to bump up the WWDC keynote in YouTube search results. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has stated that the new MacBook Pros could debut as soon as early this summer.",
