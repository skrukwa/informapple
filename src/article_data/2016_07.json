        "title": "Forbes: 'Pok\u00e9mon GO' Has 7.5M Downloads, $1.6M Daily Revenue In US Alone",
        "body": "It\u2019s probably going to be a little while until Niantic finishes up the Pok\u00e9mon GO global launch and manages to reveal any hard data about the game. But until then, estimates are already rolling in about just how much of a smash hit the mobile AR game really is.\nMarket intelligence firm Sensor Tower has told me that they estimate Pok\u00e9mon GO already has at least 7.5M US downloads on iOS and Android (Google Play only) since early Thursday, with $1.6M in daily revenue in Apple\u2019s iOS store alone, though those figures are bound to increase as new data continues to roll in.\nPok\u00e9mon GO is a free-to-play game but employs microtransactions to bring in revenue. While none are mandatory and the best way to advance in the game is simply through walking, many of the boosts for egg-hatching, Pok\u00e9mon luring, or double XP are incredibly helpful, and players have eagerly shelled out real life money for the \u201ccoins\u201d needed to buy them.\nIt\u2019s unclear what\u2019s the top seller in the Pok\u00e9-store, but I would guess Lures and Incense are very popular for those who don\u2019t want to/can\u2019t move around during the day, but I think the best value is probably buying multiple egg incubators so you can hatch more than one egg at a time (I have uh, nine).\nKeep in mind, all of this is US only, and the revenue is only for the iOS store at this point. Once the other territories are factored in, and once the game is truly released worldwide, it\u2019s hard to imagine just how big Pok\u00e9mon GO will get. I\u2019ve already seen it being called a fad that will probably soon burn out, and while I agree things may never reach the level of what we saw this opening week, even if it is a fad, it\u2019s big enough where that shouldn\u2019t matter. Pok\u00e9mon GO will make Nintendo and Niantic an absolutely ungodly amount of money, and will probably shift some of Nintendo\u2019s core priorities going forward.\nNintendo has been extremely hesitant to dive into mobile, given their own position in handheld hardware, and their first forays like Miitomo haven\u2019t exactly taken the world by storm. But here, in the form of Pok\u00e9mon GO, we have \u201cconcept + execution\u201d success in a way that has become a full blown worldwide cultural phenomenon, and players are having so much fun they don\u2019t think twice about throwing money at the game.\nObviously in the wake of Pok\u00e9mon GO\u2019s success, the game is likely to spawn a number of imitators that are chasing after this kind of revenue. But it\u2019s easy to imagine that the crux of the reason this works at all is not because AR itself has suddenly become a thing, but because this is Pok\u00e9mon we\u2019re talking about here, and I\u2019m not sure what other properties can achieve something like this without that franchise. But developers will sure try. Nintendo\u2019s last \u201cfad\u201d blockbuster hit, the Wii, made Sony make the Move and Microsoft the Kinect. Who knows what will try to ride the coattails of GO\u2019s success? But without Pok\u00e9mon, and without Niantic\u2019s years of Ingress data which serves as the skeleton for GO, it\u2019s hard to imagine anything getting anywhere close.\nEven as initial estimates, these numbers are extremely impressive, and will likely only continue to get more impressive as time goes on. For now, the craze only seems to be escalating, and with a full global launch still to come, this is only the beginning.\nUpdate: Some updates via SuperData, who says Pokemon GO has brought in $14.04 million across all mobile platforms since launch when it became the highest grossing game on both iOS and Android. In contrast, Ingress, Niantic's last AR game on which Pokemon GO is built, only made $1.1M in its entire lifespan.\nFollow me on Twitter and on Facebook.

        "title": "Apple Music Loses 3 Times More Subscribers a Month Than Spotify",
        "body": "Apple Music Loses 3 Times More Subscribers a Month Than Spotify\nSave\nSave\nApple Music has a huge problem. It\u2019s called \u2018churn\u2019\u2026\nLast week, Cowen\u2019s John Blackledge and Tim Arcuri shared some information in a recent report related to streaming churn. Specifically, on the rate at which Spotify and Apple Music lose subscribers on a monthly basis. According to Cowen, Apple Music have a subscriber churn rate of 6.4%, which is nearly three times higher than Spotify, whose churn rate is 2.2%.\nThe news is shocking, especially for those prognosticating that Apple\u2019s streaming service has the potential to outgrow Spotify. But in light of this new information, it\u2019s hard to see this being a possibility. At last count, Spotify surpassed 30 million paying users, and Apple Music announced half of that, with 15 million paying users.\nSuddenly, this horse race is taking on an entirely different dimension. Both streaming services are adding, on average, one million paying users per month. But some simple math calculating churn shows how difficult it will be for Apple to catch up to Spotify. If these churn rates are indeed correct, it could prove impossible.\nMeanwhile, Apple has been working on securing as many artist exclusives as possible, all part of a strategy to sway customers from Spotify and other competing streaming services. Considering the churn stats, that might be working in terms of getting people to sign up, but not when it comes to keeping people around.\nAnd what about lingering chatter of an Apple acquisition of Tidal? If this is indeed the case, then Apple Music may have a chance to rule the music streaming market. But without a Tidal takeover, the chances of Apple Music catching up to Spotify now seem very slim, at least without radically new growth strategies implemented.\nImage by Chris Marchant, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic.",

        "title": "iPhone 7 to Start at 32GB of Storage, Replacing 16GB Base Model",
        "body": "In a wide-ranging commentary piece about why now is a bad time to buy a new iPhone, The Wall Street Journal has confirmed that the iPhone 7 will start with 32GB of storage, replacing the infamous 16GB base tier offered since the iPhone 3GS.\nThe new iPhones are expected to have more storage for those photos. Instead of 16GB as a starting point for the entry-level iPhone, the new starting point will be 32GB, according to a person familiar with Apple\u2019s iPhone plans. Hallelujah! I\u2019ve long said that keeping the 16GB iPhone was just a ploy for Apple to get people to buy the 64GB model\u2014for $100 extra.\nThe bump from 16GB to 32GB of entry-level storage has already been widely rumored by multiple Asian sources connected with Apple's supply chain, but confirmation from The Wall Street Journal makes the claim much more credible.\nTwo of the three storage options for iPhone 7 will likely be 32GB and 128GB, while multiple sources have said that at least the larger Plus-sized 5.5-inch model will be available with 256GB of storage. It is unclear if the 4.7-inch model will also have a 256GB storage option. The current storage options for both the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus include 16GB, 64GB, and 128GB.\nThe Wall Street Journal previously confirmed that the iPhone 7 will have a thinner iPhone 6s-like design with no headphone jack and improved waterproofing. Other rumored features include a faster Apple A10 processor, repositioned antenna bands, faster LTE and Wi-Fi, and camera improvements, possibly including a dual-lens camera (and 3GB of RAM) exclusive to the 5.5-inch model.",

        "title": "iPhone 7 said to feature 14% larger battery compared to iPhone 6s",
        "body": "At this point there\u2019s a general consensus regarding many features we expect to see with the iPhone 7, but one thing that many people have been wondering about is the battery size. A sketchy report out of China earlier this year claimed the battery would \u201cslightly\u201d larger, but now we have new information that suggests a bigger increase.\nTwitter leakster OnLeaks today claims that the iPhone 7 will feature a 1960mAh battery, which is a slight upgrade from the 1715mAh battery found in the iPhone 6s. This is notable seeing that the iPhone 6 actually featured a larger 1810mAh battery than the iPhone 6s does, so at least we\u2019re not seeing another downgrade this time around.\nIt\u2019s hard to tell how notable of a change this will be in terms of battery life, seeing that there will be a change in components, which could be more power-hungry. If you look at the 1877mAh capacity of the Apple Smart Battery case, and the 8 hour increase of usage Apple claims that provides, that would put it at essentially one hour of usage at 235mAh of battery. So, with the iPhone 7 now said to feature a 1960mAh battery, we could be looking at an additional 1 hour\u2019ish of battery life.\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that with it could be that the A10 processor of the iPhone 7 is more power-hungry and Apple has to increase the battery size to make up for that. Although, fitting a 14.2 percent larger battery inside essentially the same design is notable on Apple\u2019s part.\nIt\u2019s still unclear what kind of, if any, battery improvements the iPhone 7 Plus will feature. If it sees the same 14.2 percent increase that the 4.7-inch model sees, then we can expect it to jump from 2750mAh to around 3140mAh, but it\u2019s not likely the changes will be the same in terms of percent change. For those wondering, the iPhone 6 Plus featured a 2915mAh battery.\nImproved battery life is something for which iPhone users have been calling for a long time now, but Apple has not really worked too hard in that area. Instead, it released a battery case for the iPhone 6/6s last year to appease users.\nEarlier this morning we saw a sketchy leaked image claiming to show Lightning-equipped EarPods for the iPhone 7, although an earlier report claimed that Apple would ship 3.5mm EarPods + an adapter with a device. We also saw an iPhone 7 Plus image this week that showed the dual-camera setup on the back, as well as support for the Smart Connector.\nToday\u2019s battery leak should be taken with a grain of salt, as OnLeaks notes the source is \u201cpretty reliable (not 100% but almost). Nevertheless it\u2019s reassuring that there\u2019s a possibility of the iPhone 7 featuring improved battery life. We\u2019ll have to wait for Apple to unveil the device for actual confirmation, though.\nPretty reliable (not 100% but almost\u2026) source told me #iPhone7 battery = 1960mAh (#iPhone6s = 1715mAh) \u2014 OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) July 13, 2016",

On the eve of its release in the franchise's home country of Japan, Sensor Tower is taking an updated look at the title's unprecedented launch by comparing its record-breaking surpassing of 10 million downloads in seven days to other successful mobile games. See how some of the category's biggest hitters stack up to this incredible feat after the break.\nUsing our Store Intelligence platform, we analyzed a group of 12 mega-hit mobile games on iOS and Android\u2014all of which have surpassed 10 million downloads worldwide across both platforms\u2014and calculated the number of days from their launch dates it took them to reach the 10 million milestone. The chart below shows the results, compared to Pok\u00e9mon GO.\nIn passing the 10 million mark just seven days after launching in Australia and New Zealand on July 5, Pok\u00e9mon GO smashed the previous record of nine days held by Supercell's Clash Royale. It also beat out King's latest Candy Crush Saga spin-off, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, which managed the same feat in just 12 days. One of the most highly anticipated mobile game sequels of all time, Angry Birds 2, also trails behind Pok\u00e9mon GO, having amassed more than 10 million downloads within 19 days of its launch.\nWe'll have more analysis of Pok\u00e9mon GO's unprecedented launch throughout the week, as it rolls out in Japan and other countries around the globe. Before long, we expect to be able to compare its coming-any-day-now 50 million download milestone to some of mobile gaming's most elite apps, so stay tuned.",

Instead, we got some other type of news.\nWhen the Pokemon Go went live a few days ago, Nintendo's stock price skyrocketed. The Niantic-developed game became an instant hit. The game is among the most popular apps on both Android and iOS app stores and while it is free of charge, it has lots of in-app purchases such as different amount of pokecoins varying from $1.49 to $149.99.\nYou can imagine that both Google and Apple are taking a slice of those app purchases. According to financial analyst Laura Martin from the investment banking firm Needham & Company, Pokemon Go could generate $3 billion revenue for Apple in the next 1 or 2 years. Apple's share of each in-app purchase is 30%.\nPokemon Go has already set a precedent as 53% of the in-app purchases are made of people who have paid nothing for mobile games in the six months prior.\nSource",

        "body": "The reaction to Night Shift may have been stronger than Apple anticipated. A new trademark filing suggests it\u2019s looking to bring the popular iOS feature to the desktop. And cars. And your watch!\nPatently Apple has discovered a trademark filing that suggests Apple is looking the bring the feature to just about every platform it has. While it details just about every device you can think of (seriously, it lists \u201canimated cartoons, egg-candlers, dog whistles, decorative magnets, electrified fences, portable remote-controlled car retarders, and electrically heated socks\u201d in the filing), a few caught our eye.\nIt\u2019s described only as \u201ccomputer software for controlling computer and mobile device display screens.\u201d\nIt specifically wants to control \u201ccomputers, computer hardware, motor vehicle audio apparatus, smartwatches, television monitors\u201d and \u201claptops.\u201d That just about covers Apple\u2019s ecosystem as we know it (even, you know, cars).\nThe <3 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\nUnfortunately, it also squeezes out competition. On launch, Night Shift stomped F.Lux out of the iOS space, leaving the desktop as one of its lone vestiges. If Apple brings Night Shift elsewhere, F.Lux is going to have an even harder time being competitive in Apple\u2019s world (it\u2019s still available for Android).\nNight Shift as we know it is a bit of a one-trick pony, so we should also expect more features. The color-dimming features you want in your car may not be the same you\u2019re looking for on the Watch. Apple may also need to provide some APIs to allow developers to circumvent it; designers unwittingly working on apps or Websites while Night Shift is active may end up disabling it altogether.\nA Trademark is meant to protect the name, but still suggests Apple is serious about making Night Shift more common across devices. We\u2019re not sure when it might hit your various screens \u2014 neither watchOS 3 or macOS Sierra have Night Shift, and CarPlay is not ready either \u2014 but don\u2019t be surprised when it lands.",

Evan Blass, @evleaks, said he believes the iPhone 7 will be released week of September 12. Over the weekend, he strengthened his claim by indicating that his claim is referring to the retail release date, specifically that the new iPhone will go on sale on Friday, September 16th \u2026\nA September 16 date for new iPhone availability is a tad earlier than usual, ever since the iPhone moved to a September release month. Last year, the iPhone 6s hit stores for retail availability on September 25. The iPhone 6 debuted on September 19 in 2014 and the 2013 iPhone 5s was September 20.\nWith a sooner-than-usual release date for retail availability, this also pushes the expected date for Apple\u2019s media press announcement.\nJust to clarify, this refers to the retail release, not the launch event.

This is not feasible in the 2016 calendar assuming a Friday September 16 release unless the event happened in late August. Assuming Apple wants to stay in the September timeframe, the most likely dates are September 5 or September 6 with pre-orders on that Friday (September 9) with the official launch just a week later. Apple should sent press invites for this event in mid-August which will officially confirm the date.\nBlass is well known in the technology community for product leaks, especially regarding Android devices, although his record on Apple leaks is not perfect. He suggested that the 6s, 6s Plus and 6c would launch concurrently in 2015. It transpired the 4-inch iPhone SE would not debut until the following March.\nIndependent from Blass\u2019s report, a report from Apfelpage suggests Apple may not call the device the iPhone 7 after all. It says Chinese supply chain sources have seen packaging and labelling that indicates the new phone will be called the \u2018iPhone 6SE\u2019. Given the more-iterative changes and similar design, it is not out of the question for Apple to brand the new iPhone as a continuation of the iPhone 6 line.\nPersonally, 6SE is a bit too much of a mouthful but who knows? With Apple breaking its typical tick-tock cycle of hardware launches, the name is up in the air. Apple could employ a new suffix, like 6X, or even a word like \u2018Pro\u2019 to denote the refinements over last year\u2019s hardware.\nThe most likely option is probably iPhone 7 but it\u2019s not impossible to think that Apple will change up its naming scheme alongside the juncture in product strategy. A significant design revamp, with glass enclosure and edge-to-edge screen, is reportedly set for the 2017 iPhone. Apple is seemingly moving to a 3-year major refresh cycle going forward for new iPhone hardware.\nIf the report is true, we\u2019ll have the new iPhone in our hands in a month and a half. We\u2019ll be looking for Apple to send out press invites to a media event in late August. The iPhone 7 is unlikely to be the only new hardware to be announced, the event will likely also feature the Apple Watch 2 and maybe new Macs or iPad updates. Stay tuned to 9to5Mac for the latest on iPhone 7 and Apple\u2019s fall product announcements in general.",

        "body": "Update: Apple has posted an official press release detailing the new organ donor options in iOS 10 Health. Apple will allow users to sign up for organ, eye and tissue donor registry via Donate Life America. The registrations are sent to the National Donate Life Registry \u2014 the interface will surface as part of Health\u2019s Medical ID feature.\nApple will promote organ donation with its newest mobile operating system, iOS 10, when it ships in the fall. Via the Associated Press, Apple will include a new simple sign-up button inside the Health app to enable users to register to become an organ donor in a national donor registry. It appears the integrated sign up option will only be available to US iPhone customers, at least at launch.\nTim Cook told the AP that he hopes Apple\u2019s efforts will help improve the availability of organs to those that need them, saying that the problem \u201chit home when Apple co-founder Steve Jobs endured an excruciating wait for a liver transplant in 2009\u201d.\nIn a statement, Apple COO Jeff Williams said \u2018With the updated Health app, we\u2019re providing education and awareness about organ donation and making it easier than ever to register.\u2019.\nThe organ donor signup feature is not included in the current iOS 10 beta seed. There is still plenty of time for the feature to appear by September, when iOS 10 will likely be released as a public software update to all.\nOrgan donor registration will be integrated into Medical ID with iOS 10. https://t.co/tPxuGLtzJk pic.twitter.com/kBcH63kDAS \u2014 Benjamin Mayo (@bzamayo) July 5, 2016\nPerhaps the functionality will be included in iOS 10 beta 2, which is \u2018late\u2019 according to typical iOS 10 seed cycles where the second beta follows WWDC about two weeks later. It is unknown why the usual beta cycle schedule has been changed for iOS 10 although there\u2019s a good chance the new seed will drop later today.\niOS 10 includes a variety of changes including a redesign of the Health app with larger buttons and more information presented upfront as daily summaries.",

        "body": "On the day Apple confirms plans to release 14 special edition Olympic Games Apple Watch straps, the latest Wristly survey confirms an astonishing 94 percent of existing Apple Watch customers are still satisfied with their devices.\nNew software promise\nThat\u2019s a big deal, even though Apple Watch sales have reportedly slowed pending the fall software update. Apple isn\u2019t the only watchmaker feeling the flatness, Swiss watch industry exports fell faster than ever before in 1H 2016, and all eyes now are on Apple this fall when new software and potentially new watch designs may be in the frame.\n\u201cWith the pace at which processors and core hardware system components are improving these days we can reasonably expect 25% to 30% higher performance and battery life for the next Apple Watch,\u201d Wristly\u2019s Bernard Desarnauts\u2019 writes.\nChallenges include\u2026\nWristly has identified some of the challenges Apple faces as it tries to build Apple Watch sales, but perhaps the biggest and most paradoxical problem is that even though customers are incredibly satisfied with their devices, they don\u2019t yet seem ready to recommend one to their friends.\nThe good news is that the three biggest reasons they won\u2019t recommend the device are for the most part being addressed in the next edition of watchOS.\nMore speed and better overall performance including battery\nMore utility and various capabilities\nMore independence from iPhone.\nThe Wristly survey suggests that for most customers expectation of a new model this fall and a desire for performance improvements (and standalone connectivity) are the big inhibitors to stop people recommending the device.\nEveryday people\nThe researchers also found that most Apple Watch users continue to wear their watch every day.\n14 percent wear it all the time, including while sleeping;\n73 percent wear it all day;\n9 percent wear it most of the day.\nOf the remaining 4 percent just one in a hundred Apple Watch customers has given up using the device.\nWith so many people wearing their Watch on a daily basis, you\u2019d be forgiven for expecting to hear reports of damaged devices. You\u2019ll be disappointed if you are waiting for those -- 95 percent of users say their Watch remains in at least good condition.\nWhere we are right now is that the Apple Watch appears to be a device that users love which is robust enough to withstand the stresses and strains of being used every day. Most users can\u2019t wait for the future watchOS 3 software upgrade, as they think it will address most of the perceived limitations of the device, such as performance.\nIf the software upgrade delivers what we all think it will, then this may well unlock a wave of product recommendations as customers get hyped about their smartwatch all over again.\nI\u2019m with the bands\nReturning to Apple\u2019s Olympic bands (and you can find out more about how Apple makes nylon bands here), and it seems Apple has quietly created a new business \u2013 watchstraps.\n\u201cAt least 78 percent [of Apple Watch owners] have purchased a second band and there are an average of 3.4 bands per owner,\u201d said Wristly. In fact, one-in-ten Apple Watch owners already have five or more bands, according to the 1,000-person sample group.\n\u201cBrilliant! Once again Apple revolutionizes an industry with something so seemingly simple and leaves everyone else wondering why they didn\u2019t think of it first,\u201d one Apple Watch user told Wristly.\nApple designed an all-new way of easily attaching and removing Apple Watch bands. It\u2019s incredibly simple and very effective. \u201cIt took a tech company to invent a mechanism that most of us could operate without the need to visit a watch service store,\u201d write Wristly. It takes most (81%) of customers under a minute to swap bands across.\nFinally a note about Apple Watch sales: Apple\u2019s kept these really quiet, but Wristly has assembled anecdotal data to suggest a 40 percent increase in the number of Apple Watch users since January.\nWe have seen estimates of 12 million sales, (I don\u2019t know how accurate these estimates might be), but if there are indeed 3.4 bands per owner then Apple might have sold as many as 42 million bands so far \u2013 which equates to a fairly substantial accessory business in itself (even at $49 per strap that's big money).\nGoogle+?

        "title": "Apple Fires Back At Spotify For Asking For \"Preferential Treatment\"",
        "body": "Spotify says Apple is using its App Store approval process as \"a weapon.\" Apple says that claim is a load of BS.\nIn a letter sent to Spotify general counsel Horacio Gutierrez on Friday, Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell rebutted the streaming music service's June 26 allegations that Apple is \u201ccausing grave harm to Spotify and its customers\u201d by rejecting a recent update to Spotify\u2019s iOS app. \"We find it troubling that you are asking for exemptions to the rules we apply to all developers and are publicly resorting to rumors and half-truths about our service,\" Sewell wrote in a letter obtained by BuzzFeed News.\nApple declined comment on the letter.\nSpotify had alleged that Apple rejected a new version of its app citing \"business model\" rules. It also claimed the company insisted that Spotify use Apple\u2019s billing system if it planned to sell subscriptions (Background: Apple charges a monthly fee of up to 30 percent for the use of that system; Spotify has long charged an additional $2.99 for in-app subscriptions to avoid that \u201cApp Store tax\u201d ). Gutierrez characterized this as anticompetitive. \u201cIt continues a troubling pattern of behavior by Apple to exclude and diminish the competitiveness of Spotify on iOS and as a rival to Apple Music, particularly when seen against the backdrop of Apple\u2019s previous anticompetitive conduct aimed at Spotify,\" he wrote.\nUnsurprisingly, Apple strongly disagrees.\n\"Our guidelines apply equally to all app developers, whether they are game developers, e-book sellers, video-streaming services or digital music distributors; and regardless of whether or not they compete against Apple. We did not alter our behavior or our rules when we introduced our own music streaming service or when Spotify became a competitor,\" Sewell explains. \"Ironically, it is now Spotify that wants things to be different by asking for preferential treatment from Apple.\"\nAnd as for Spotify's suggestion that Apple is treading on dangerous, anticompetitive ground, well, Sewell doesn't seem too concerned.\n\"There is nothing in Apple's conduct that 'amounts to a violation of applicable antitrust laws.' Far from it,\" Sewell, writes after wryly observing that not only has Apple\u2019s platform generated \"hundreds of millions of dollars in incremental revenue to Spotify\" but that the Spotify App currently in the App Store is still in violation of Apple's guidelines. \"I would be happy to facilitate an expeditious review and approval of your app as soon as you provide us with something that is compliant with the App Store\u2019s rules,\" he quips.",

        "title": "This blind Apple engineer is transforming the tech world at only 22",
        "body": "Apple engineer Jordyn Castor has never been one for limitations.\nShe was born 15 weeks early, weighing just under two pounds. Her grandfather could hold her in the palm of his hand, and could even slide his wedding ring along her arm and over her shoulder. Doctors said she had a slim chance of survival.\nIt was Castor's first brush with limited expectations -- and also the first time she shattered them.\nSEE ALSO: How the Apple Watch wants to be the first fitness tracker for people in wheelchairs\nCastor, now 22, has been blind since birth, a result of her early delivery. But throughout childhood, her parents encouraged her to defy expectations of people with disabilities, motivating her to be adventurous, hands-on and insatiably curious.\nIt was that spirit that led to her interact with technology, whether it was the desktop computer her family bought when she was in second grade, or the classroom computer teachers encouraged her to use in school.\n\"I could help make technology more accessible for blind users.\"\nShe says the adults in her life would often hand her a gadget, telling her to figure it out and show them how to use it. And she would.\n\"I realized then I could code on the computer to have it fulfill the tasks I wanted it to,\" says Castor, whose current work focuses on enhancing features like VoiceOver for blind Apple users. \"I came to realize that with my knowledge of computers and technology, I could help change the world for people with disabilities.\n\"I could help make technology more accessible for blind users.\"\nBringing a personal perspective to Apple innovation\nThere's an often overlooked component of \"diversity\" in workplace initiatives -- the need to include the perspectives of people with disabilities.\nKeeping tabs on the needs of the blind and low-vision community is a key component of Apple's innovation in accessibility. Castor is proof of how much that can strengthen a company.\nShe was a college student at Michigan State University when she was first introduced to Apple at a Minneapolis job fair in 2015. Castor went to the gathering of employers, already knowing the tech giant would be there -- and she was nervous.\n\"You aren't going to know unless you try,\" she thought. \"You aren't going to know unless you talk to them ... so go.\"\nApple engineer Jordyn Castor poses for a headshot. Castor is a driving force behind accessibility of Apple products, especially for blind users. Credit: Provided by Apple and Jordyn Castor\nCastor told Apple reps how amazed she was by the iPad she received as a gift for her 17th birthday just a few years earlier. It raised her passion for tech to another level -- mainly due to the iPad's immediate accessibility.\n\"Everything just worked and was accessible just right out of the box,\" Castor tells Mashable. \"That was something I had never experienced before.\"\n\"I'm directly impacting the lives of the blind community.\"\nSarah Herrlinger, senior manager for global accessibility policy and initiatives at Apple, says a notable part of the company's steps toward accessibility is its dedication to making inclusivity features standard, not specialized. This allows those features to be dually accessible -- both for getting the tech to more users, as well as keeping down costs.\n\"[These features] show up on your device, regardless of if you are someone who needs them,\" Herrlinger tells Mashable. \"By being built-in, they are also free. Historically, for the blind and visually impaired community, there are additional things you have to buy or things that you have to do to be able to use technology.\"\nAt that job fair in 2015, Castor's passion for accessibility and Apple was evident. She was soon hired as an intern focusing on VoiceOver accessibility.\nGet Mashable Deals delivered to your inbox daily Be the first to know about price drops on Apple products. Loading... Subscribe By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy Thanks for signing up!\nAs her internship came to a close, Castor's skills as an engineer and advocate for tech accessibility were too commanding to let go. She was hired full-time as an engineer on the accessibility design and quality team -- a group of people Castor describes as \"passionate\" and \"dedicated.\"\n\"I'm directly impacting the lives of the blind community,\" she says of her work. \"It's incredible.\"\nInnovation with blind users in mind\nIncreased accessibility for all users is one of Apple's driving values, under the mantra \"inclusion inspires innovation.\"\nHerrlinger says the company loves what it makes, and wants what it makes to be available to everyone. She describes the need to continuously innovate with accessibility in mind as part of Apple's DNA.\n\"Accessibility is something that is never-ending,\" Herrlinger says. \"It isn't something where you just do it once, check that box and then move on to do other things.\"\nAnd it's a dedication that isn't going unnoticed by the blind community. On July 4, Apple was the recipient of the American Council of the Blind's Robert S. Bray Award for the company's strides in accessibility and continued dedication to inclusion-based innovation for blind users.\nSarah Herrlinger, senior manager for global accessibility policy and initiatives at Apple, and Eric Bridges, executive director of the American Council of the Blind (ACB), pose with the Robert S. Bray award at ACB's national conference on July 4, 2016. Credit: PRovided by Apple and ACB\nThe company, for example, made the first touchscreen device accessible to the blind via VoiceOver. Recent announcements of Siri coming to Mac this fall, and of newer innovations, like a magnifying glass feature for low-vision users, have continued the promise of improving the Apple experience for those who are blind and low vision.\n\"The fact that we take the time to innovate in these ways is something new and different,\" Herrlinger says. \"It was not the expected thing in the tech community.\"\n\"[Accessibility] isn't something where you just do it once, check that box and then move on to do other things.\"\nOften, the success of such innovations depends on the input of the community -- and employees like Castor provide irreplaceable first-hand insight into the tech experience for blind individuals.\nThe most recent example of community-driven innovation can be found on the Apple Watch. During a meeting, Herrlinger explains, a person who sees could easily peer down at their watch to keep an eye on the clock. A person who is blind, however, hasn't had a way to tell time without VoiceOver.\nAfter confronting the conundrum, Apple solved the issue by making a feature that tells time through vibrations. The addition, Herrlinger says, is coming to watchOS 3 this fall.\nHigh-tech meets low-tech\nCastor says her own success -- and her career -- hinges on two things: technology and Braille. That may sound strange to many people, even to some who are blind and visually impaired. Braille and new tech are often depicted as at odds with one another, with Braille literacy rates decreasing as the presence of tech increases.\nBut many activists argue that Braille literacy is the key to employment and stable livelihood for blind individuals. With more than 70% of blind people lacking employment, the majority of those who are employed -- an estimated 80% -- have something in common: They read Braille.\n\"Braille allows me to know what the code feels like.\"\nFor Castor, Braille is crucial to her innovative work at Apple -- and she insists tech is complementary to Braille, not a replacement.\n\"I use a Braille display every time I write a piece of code,\" she says. \"Braille allows me to know what the code feels like.\"\nIn coding, she uses a combination of Nemeth Braille -- or \"math Braille\" -- and Alphabetic Braille. Castor even says that with the heavy presence of tech in her life, she still prefers to read meeting agendas in Braille.\n\"I can see grammar. I can see punctuation. I can see how things are spelled and how things are written out,\" she says.\nThe technologies that Apple creates support her love of Braille, too -- there are various modifications, like Braille displays that can to plug into devices, to help her code and communicate. But Castor also often forgoes Braille displays, solely using VoiceOver to navigate her devices and read screens.\nA Braille display like this one, which is compatible with Apple products, allows blind users to navigate technology using Braille commands. Credit: PRovided by Apple\nThat autonomy of choice in accessibility, Apple says, is intentional. The company believes that the ability to choose -- to have several tools at a user's disposal, whenever they want them -- is key to its accessibility values.\nGiving back to the community\nLast week, Castor attended a conference hosted by the National Federation of the Blind, where she gave a speech telling her story. She says the impact that Apple has had on the blind community was extremely clear as soon as she stepped into the conference hall -- just by listening to what was going on around her.\n\"When I walk through the convention, I hear VoiceOver everywhere,\" she says. \"Being able to give back through something that so many people use is amazing.\"\nCastor was recently able to use her presence and perspective at Apple to give back to a part of the community she's especially passionate about -- the next generation of engineers.\nShe was a driving force behind accessibility on Apple's soon-to-be released Swift Playgrounds, an intro-to-coding program geared toward children. She's been working to make the program accessible to blind children, who have been waiting a long time for the tool, she says.\n\"I would constantly get Facebook messages from so many parents of blind children, saying, 'My child wants to code so badly. Do you know of a way that they can do that?'\" Castor says. \"Now, when it's released, I can say, 'Absolutely, absolutely they can start coding.'\"\nPromotional materials for Swift Playgrounds show how the program will work when released in fall. Users will code commands to make a character move throughout puzzle-like challenges. The program will use VoiceOver to be accessible to blind children. Credit: Provided by Apple\nCastor says working on Swift Playgrounds has been an empowering experience, and her team has deeply valued her perspective on the VoiceOver experience for blind users.\n\"[Blindness] does not define you or what you can do in life.\"\nShe says the task-based, interactive app would have made a massive impact on her as a child. The program is, after all, a guided way of taking tech and figuring out what makes it tick -- a virtual version of the hands-on curiosity adults instilled in her as a child.\n\"It will allow children to dive into code,\" she says of the program. \"They can use Swift Playgrounds right away out of the box; no modifications. Just turn on VoiceOver and be able to start coding.\"\nAs someone who was always encouraged to challenge expectations, Castor says she has one simple message for the next generation of blind coders, like the children who will sit down with Swift Playgrounds in the fall.\n\"Blindness does not define you,\" she says. \"It's part of who you are as a person, as a characteristic -- but it does not define you or what you can do in life.\"\nHave something to add to this story?

        "title": "Google is making better apps for the iPhone than for Android",
        "body": "Here\u2019s a thing I didn\u2019t really expect to write: I\u2019m finding that I enjoy Google\u2019s apps more on iOS than I do on Android. Or more specifically: I think that there\u2019s more interesting innovation coming out of Google\u2019s iOS app teams than on Android \u2014 at least for the moment.\nBack in May, my colleague Ben Popper talked about how Google\u2019s apps on iOS were so good that he saw little reason to switch over to Android, despite the fact that he spends so much time in Google\u2019s waters. Lately, I\u2019ve found myself in basically the same boat. Email? Inbox. Calendar? Google Calendar. Keyboard? Gboard. Maps? Duh. The list goes on and on.\nBen already praised Gboard, Google\u2019s excellent keyboard. I like it too, despite the fact that third-party keyboards on iOS still feel like a buggy mess sometimes. Because of Apple\u2019s restrictions, you can\u2019t use dictation and it sometimes just plain doesn\u2019t even appear when you need it. But even though all that is super aggravating, the clever features and touches inside the keyboard keep me coming back to it.\nGoogle on the iPhone is sometimes better than Google on Android\nIt\u2019s so good, it makes me wonder why the hell it isn\u2019t on Android. Apparently there are plans to \"bring the same functionality to Android,\" but it sure seems like the iOS side of things is where the innovation is happening right now. Perhaps it's that constraints tend to breed creative solutions, or perhaps it\u2019s just that \u2013 even for Google engineers \u2014 iOS is simply easier to develop great apps for.\nApple\u2019s continued refusal to allow us to set third party apps as the default for things like browsers, calendars, and (above all) email means that there are sometimes hoops to jump through. But Apple has also, ever so slightly, made tools like widgets and advanced share sheets that allow these third party apps to not feel totally isolated from the rest of the phone. (I\u2019m excited to see this trend accelerate in iOS 10.)\nLet\u2019s take one example: Hangouts, Google\u2019s oft-maligned (and justly so!) chat app. On iOS, it feels coherent and consistent. On Android, the design and placement of the buttons change seemingly every other month. On iOS, you can use extensions to share directly to a person in a chat right inside the pop-up share sheet. Google added the ability for apps to do something like that on Android in October 2015, with a feature called \"Direct Share.\" Hangouts only began supporting it last month.\nGboard, Google Search, and Hangouts on Android could all learn from their iOS counterparts\nHere\u2019s another: Google Search! It\u2019s built deeply into Android, yet often feels stateless. You do a search, but after you\u2019re done it\u2019s just sort of gone into the ether of the OS, not stored in a browser tab or anywhere else that\u2019s easy to find. For example, on the new version of Android coming out later this year, doing a Google search and tapping on a link brings up a random browser window. Close it and it\u2019s gone. But inside the Google search app on iOS, the stuff you look at is kept in a history of vertically scrolling cards that you can reference later. It\u2019s super helpful.\nOf course, these Google apps still don\u2019t feel nearly as integrated into the iPhone as Apple\u2019s own, increasingly subpar, apps. Which is a huge bummer, because Google seems to be working way harder at coming up with clever new app ideas than Apple is. Take a look at Inbox. It integrates the ideas of bundling similar emails, snoozing them, and integrating basic reminders all into your email. I really love it, but even if you don\u2019t like it, you have to admit that Google is pushing more on the idea of rethinking email than Apple is right now. (For the record, Inbox on Android and iOS are about at parity, quality-wise).\nMotion Stills is my favorite app of the past six months\nBut the app that has delighted me more than anything else in the past month is Google\u2019s Motion Stills app. It\u2019s just remarkably good \u2014 and it\u2019s quickly become the default way that I look at photos.\nWe\u2019ve actually written about how lovely this app is in the past, but allow me to pile on. What\u2019s remarkable about Motion Stills is that with it, Google has cracked a code that literally every phone maker \u2014 Apple included \u2014 has been trying to figure out for over three years now. The challenge: take advantage of the fact that smartphone cameras can take small movies as easily as snapping a photo, then making it totally shareable in the places where we actually share photos.\nHTC tried with with Zoe, Samsung has a Gif mode you have to manually toggle into, and even Apple itself is trying it with Live Photos. Each, for different reasons, feels a little bit like a failed experiment.\nHere\u2019s what happens with a live photo: it takes a little movie every time you shoot a picture. To view that movie in Apple Photos, you have to 3D Touch or (if you don\u2019t have a 3D Touch device) press-and-hold on the image to see it. That\u2019s fine, I guess, but it\u2019s not very fun or whimsical.\nSeriously, tell me which of these is more likely to make you happy, because the answer is obvious.\nWhat Google\u2019s Motion Stills does is just take all those little movies and put them in a big old vertical scroll, Instagram-style. I now exclusively look at my photos this way because it\u2019s just so much more fun and alive than trying to remember to press (or seeing a tiny bit of movement when you switch from photo to photo). I see lovely little moments of people posing themselves, preparing to be photographed. I have a video of my Herculean efforts to smile before reverting to my resting grump face:\nWhat\u2019s more \u2014 and better \u2014 is that Motion Stills just works as a GIF or a short movie. Those are the formats we actually use to share moving pictures right now, the formats that work in any app and across any device (excepting, well, a lot of iOS apps and devices. Ahem). Instead of just letting us use what we are already using, Apple is trying to get everybody to support a new format that was designed to only work on iOS.\nBut back to the main point \u2014 what\u2019s most amazing about Motion Stills is that it\u2019s on an iPhone, not an Android phone. It\u2019s done a better job of getting me to take more photos and enjoy more photos than any other camera innovation in the past year, and it took Google\u2019s willingness to be open and Apple\u2019s strength at making good camera hardware to make it happen.\nThis is the part where I make a grand pronouncement about how Google needs to try harder on Android and work harder to take advantage of what Android can do. Or maybe it\u2019s the part where Apple needs to either improve its apps or open up iOS and get out of the way a little more. I believe all of those things, but I also can\u2019t work myself up into a lather about them. Google will bring some of these neat ideas to Android. iOS 10 will make it slightly easier to use the apps you actually like across the entire OS. It\u2019ll just take a minute.\nIn the meanwhile, just promise me that you\u2019ll turn Live Photos back on and use Google\u2019s Motion Stills app to browse them. In return, I promise you will have a few more smiles than you did before.",

        "body": "After the first ever example of Mac ransomware was found in the wild earlier this year, Bitdefender Labs has found what it tells us is only the second example of true Mac malware to enter circulation this year, which it has dubbed Backdoor.MAC.Elanor. The malware application was available on a number of (formerly?) reputable download sites such as MacUpdate.\nThe backdoor is embedded into a fake file converter application that is accessible online on reputable sites offering Mac applications and software. The EasyDoc Converter.app poses as a drag-and-drop file converter, but has no real functionality \u2013 it simply downloads a malicious script. This is a nasty backdoor that can steal data, execute remote code and access the webcam, among other things \u2026\nBitdefender explains that the malware that was discovered within the application titled EasyDoc Converter would install a Tor hidden service, a web service, and a Pastebin agent to each infected system. Technical lead Tiberius Axinte says that there is no real limit to what the Backdoor.MAC.Elanor malware can do.\nThis type of malware is particularly dangerous as it\u2019s hard to detect and offers the attacker full control of the compromised system. For instance, someone can lock you out of your laptop, threaten to blackmail you to restore your private files or transform your laptop into a botnet to attack other devices. The possibilities are endless.\nThe good news is that the malicious app is not signed by an Apple Developer ID, so as long as you have your Mac set only to open apps from the Mac App Store or known developers, it won\u2019t open. It does, though, emphasize the importance of exercising caution even when downloading apps from reputable sites.\nBitfender has promised more technical details of the malware later this morning. The full report from Bitdefender is available now.\nUpdate 07/06/2016 11:00 AM PDT:\nRemoved paragraph incorrectly stating Thomas Reed\u2019s involvement in reporting Bitdefender\u2019s malware discovery to MacUpdate. Thomas Reed had written a blog post last year in regards to a tweet mentioning MacUpdate installing what he considered \u201cadware\u201d.\nAdded paragraph explaining what is installed with the previously available malware.",

        "title": "What I Learned From 10 Years of Doing PR for Apple",
        "body": "I first started working for Apple on the PR agency side at Porter Novelli in Sydney, Australia in 1997. Steve Jobs had just returned to the company and the product line was a shamble of computers with confusing names, printers, scanners, and a curious, yet ill-conceived PDA called the Newton.\nThe outlook for Apple was bleak \u2014 most media wrote the company off as a shadow of its former self. The news at the time was an endless recycling of headlines such as \u201cRotten to the Core\u201d \u201cSweeping Layoffs Expected at Apple\u201d and \u201c101 Ways to Save Apple.\u201d\nLittle did I know that over the next 10 years I\u2019d be part of the biggest corporate turnaround in global history. From Sydney I moved to Singapore, where I joined the company and led Asia Pacific regional communications. Eventually, I was transferred to the mothership, Apple\u2019s Cupertino, California headquarters to join Apple\u2019s product PR team.\nOver this period, Apple would prove the cynics wrong and dazzle the world with its groundbreaking innovations, masterful marketing and against-the-grain approach. PR played a huge role in this success. Here are five lessons from those days that have played a huge influence on how I approach the craft of communications still today.\nKeep it simple. If you ran any Apple press release through a readability level test it would most likely score a level easily understood by an average 4th grade student or lower. Any hint of jargon, clich\u00e9, or techno mumbo-jumbo would be removed in the editing process. If a \u201cmere mortal\u201d couldn\u2019t understand our language, then we had failed. And failure was not an option. Steve Jobs read and personally approved every press release.\nRun your communications through a readability test to determine how difficult the language is to comprehend as written on a scale of 1 \u2013 100. These are available free on sites such as Word Count Tools and Readability Score. Ideally, you want your content to score 80 \u2013 89, and requiring the education of an 11-year old child. The easier your communications are to understand, the broader the reach.\nValue reporters\u2019 time. We reserved press releases and events for only the most important products or company milestones. Many significant products, software updates, and personnel changes went by with barely a PR push. Sometimes this would frustrate our internal clients who wanted more market noise about their pet projects or people. But by adopting this approach, reporters knew that when we contacted them we had something important to say.\nContact reporters sparingly and only when you have something compelling to offer. Don\u2019t blast out press releases to mass lists. Research what a reporter covers and make a tailored pitch.\nBe hands on. Before we would grant interviews to top executives or send out products for review, we made sure that every reporter, influencer, or analyst had a hands-on product briefing. We would take them through why we designed the button that way or removed that port at the back and point out subtle features they may not see or appreciate without our guidance. After the interview we would follow up to see if they had other questions and subtly probe how their story was shaping up so we could report back. If they were having an issue getting something to work we\u2019d have product marketing and technical support on call 24/7 to help. If the story was shaping into something deviating from our key message, we would ramp up efforts to course-correct.\nOnce you\u2019ve got a reporter\u2019s interest, follow up diligently but don\u2019t be a pest. If they are reviewing your product, offer to drop it off in person and do a quick demonstration. If they are doing a story about a service you provide, offer up some hand-picked customer and industry references. Ask if they need any images to use with the story. Do they need help understanding where your product fits in with the competition?\nStay focused. Our mission was to tell the story of how our innovative products were giving customers the power to unleash their creativity and change the world. On any given day we\u2019d have all kinds of incoming requests asking for spokespeople to chime in on industry trends, politics, personnel and countless other subjects. If the request didn\u2019t fit in with our mission, we politely declined to participate. It was an approach that helped us use our time most efficiently.\nStrive to become an expert in your field. Define your key messages and stick to them. Don\u2019t dilute your social media accounts with off-subject messaging. Offer your help to journalists and industry analysts who cover your field \u2014 even if there\u2019s not always a direct benefit to you.\nPrioritize media influencers. We didn\u2019t work with long media lists. Instead, we focused on a relatively small number of reporters who we believed set the tone for others to follow. We\u2019d offer these reporters such things as exclusive interviews, following a launch or first shot at reviewing new products. By keeping the number small, our hands-on approach was more manageable. After the initial coverage from influencers, we\u2019d expand our reach to regional reporters and trade publications.\nFocus on cultivating close relationships with the top five-to-ten media influencers who cover your field. Again, don\u2019t over-pitch them. Give them feedback on what you are hearing about their articles from colleagues and partners in the industry. Comment and start discussions on their stories on their Twitter and LinkedIn feeds. When you have an announcement coming up, consider offering them an exclusive angle.\nMost importantly, respect your brand. That\u2019s the biggest lesson of all that I learned at Apple. It\u2019s your biggest asset and you have to protect it. Think twice before giving away your products in a raffle. Think carefully about what other brands you associate with. Think different in your approach and aim to stand out from the pack.\nPerhaps not every PR team has the luxury of declining requests and being selective about which reporter they work with, but I still value these lessons today. There\u2019s no doubt this approach, applied consistently through some lean but innovation-rich years for Apple, contributed greatly to the company\u2019s dramatic turnaround and success still today.",

        "body": "Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, Westpac Banking Corp and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank have asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to give them permission to collectively negotiate with Apple.\nThey are hoping that together they can use their collective muscle to convince the technology giant to allow their digital wallets to be loaded onto iPhones.\nThe banks fear that if more people begin to pay for things by tapping phones rather than tapping cards, their customers who also use iPhones will not receive new payment and digital wallet offerings.\nThe banks also want common standards on fraud prevention and want Apple to be part of that process.\nThe banks want their digital wallets on iPhones. David Paul Morris\nThe ACCC said on Wednesday the banks are seeking authorisation \"on behalf of themselves and potentially other credit and debit card issuers to engage in limited collective negotiation with providers of third-party mobile wallet services on conditions relating to competition, best practice standards, and efficiency and transparency\".\nAdvertisement\nANZ Banking Group recently struck a deal with Apple for access to Apple Pay, stealing a march on the other banks, which are not on the service.\nBut under its arrangement, which is believed to give up some of the bank interchange fee to Apple, ANZ's cards are loaded into Apple's digital wallet in order to interact with the payment terminals.\nAlthough all the big Australian banks have applications that can be downloaded by iPhone users to conduct mobile banking, Apple lets only Apple Pay access the handset's NFC (near-field communications) antenna.\nApple has locked its devices down so that the banks' own digital wallets cannot access the iPhone's antenna.\nThis prevents the bank wallets from being used to make payments on contactless terminals \u2013 the key functionality of a digital wallet.\nCBA has developed a workaround by asking its customers who carry iPhones and want to use its digital wallet to affix a sticker on the back of their phone to act as an antenna but it is understood this has not been widely adopted by customers.\nAdvertisement\nCollective boycott\nThe ACCC said the applicants also seek authorisation to enter into a limited form of collective boycott in relation to a third-party mobile wallet provider while collective negotiations with that provider are ongoing.\nWhile banks, retailers and airlines are all looking to develop software to create digital wallets, Apple's digital wallet points to the product being a combination of software and its proprietary hardware.\nANZ Banking Group recently struck a deal with Apple for access to Apple Pay, stealing a march on the other banks, who are not on the service. Jessica Hromas\nIt is important to the major companies in all industries as digital wallets will increasingly be used for holding rewards cards and other loyalty offers, tickets, coupons and digital identity documentation.\nThe thorny issue of fee negotiations has been excluded from the ACCC application.\nAdvertisement\nIt remains unclear whether Apple will consider entering negotiations with the banks if interim authorisation to conduct the collective negotiations is provided by the banks.\nApple did not respond to a request to comment.\nFear of Apple disruption\nThe application reflects growing unease among incumbent businesses about the power of Apple, and its \"all-or-nothing\" approach to commercial negotiations.\nWhile the ACCC application has been made by the four banks, it is understood the parties are happy for other companies to join any negotiations that might take place.\nRetailers such as Coles and Myer and airlines Qantas and Virgin are all exploring digital wallets.\nAdvertisement\nThe banks have asked the ACCC to provide interim authorisation for the negotiations and consider them urgent because Transport for NSW will next year trial open-loop tap-and-go cards on the NSW transport system.\nThis will allow allow anyone with a bank-issued Visa or MasterCard to tap those cards on the Opal terminals. While about 8 per cent of Australians are tapping their mobile phones to pay, according to data from RFi Group, the banks expect this to increase rapidly once transport systems are opened up. This was the experience in London when transport cards there went open loop.\nBanks also want to talk to Apple about fraud protection, after fraud spiked in the United States when Apple Pay was launched after thieves began targeting the \"on-boarding\" of cards onto the phones.\nBanks want a set of common security standards enacted for setting up digital wallets.\nNovantas senior adviser Lance Blockley, who is working on behalf of the banks, said the ACCC application was about providing Australians with real choice and better outcomes.\n\"If successful, the application would have tremendous benefits for the entire Australian mobile payments landscape, including for public transport fares, airlines, ticketing, store loyalty and rewards programs and many more applications yet to be developed,\" Mr Blockley said.",

        "title": "Apple's next Retina Display frontier: Wide Color",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nWithout a Wide Color display, this box only appears to be solid orange\nIn 2010, Steve Jobs introduced a new leap forward in display resolution for iPhone 4 that passed up the rest of the industry to deliver pixels virtually invisible to the human eye. For iPhone 7, Apple appears to be making a similar leap in the realm of \"Retina Color.\"\nApple's new work on Wide Color results in lush, vibrant greens and vivid reds that today's basic screens can't even reproduce. After seeing Wide Color at work\u2014 it's currently available on new iMacs and the newest 9.7 inch iPad Pro\u2014 regular displays look flat and lifeless in comparison, much the same way that iPhone 4's debut of the Retina Display created a new \"no going back\" milestone in users' expectations for modern mobile electronics.\nThe image above, created by Apple's WebKit team, appears to be just an orange square on standard RGB displays. However, from a device capable of supporting the DCI-P3 Wide Color Gamut, you can see a logo. The before and after display of Wide Color images is even more impressive when viewing vibrant landscape images.\nThis year, it appears Apple is set to again change expectations in the realm of the colors that users see\u2014 and can capture\u2014 every day on their iPhones, despite very little being talked about color accuracy and reproduction among mobile device vendors outside of Apple.\nIt is, however, an emerging focus among HDTV vendors, who see Wide Color as an essential component of High Dynamic Range TVs. Wide Color not just a hardware issue; it connects to production, distribution and capture.\nIn the realm of TV, Wide Color is an industry effort. On mobile devices, it will require integration between software developers and hardware makers. The fact that Apple has already introduced Macs and iPads supporting Wide Color underlines its unique ability to deliver new technology in ways that matter, something that broadly licensed platforms\u2014 particularly value engineered platforms like Google's Android\u2014 have struggled with.\nWide Color is part of what TV vendors are branding as \"High Dynamic Range\"\nThis all happened before\nPrior to Jobs' launch of iPhone 4, a variety of Android phones\u2014 such as the Motorola Atrix\u2014 were already being hyped for introducing higher resolution screens: the Atrix boasted 960x540 pixels versus the original iPhone's 480x320.\nThere was some fudging involved to achieve that higher resolution: the Atrix and other 2010-era Androids commonly used PenTile AMOLED, a cheaper display technology that claimed a high pixel resolution despite actually supplying a third less sub pixels (by arranging more greens and fewer reds and blues). As a result, reviews described Motorola's Atrix as having \"inaccurate colors and poor viewing angles, not to mention practically unreadable text at its furthest zoom.\"\nAdditionally, rather than using the extra resolution to enhance the quality of the display, Android makers simply followed what PC makers had been doing with extra pixels: stretching out the 'desktop' to expand across a larger display, or scaling down the UI to fit more content on the same screen.\nOn PCs, higher resolution displays had typically been tied to the advancement of incrementally larger PC monitors. On mobile devices however, adding more pixels tied to a larger screen were resulting in bigger phones\u2014 with obvious disadvantages. Further, higher resolutions were also making tap targets smaller and scaling down text to the point where it became more difficult to read. Apple's iPhone 4 Retina Display harnessed technical progress in a new direction\nApple's iPhone 4 Retina Display harnessed technical progress in a new direction: it kept the user interface at the same scale and increased the pixel count four-fold, resulting in very crisp text and precise detail of everything on the screen, rendering pixels virtually invisible.\nIn hindsight, Apple's strategy for resolution leap was obvious. However, it wasn't immediately copied. Samsung's original Galaxy Note \"fablet\" debuted a year after iPhone 4, but rather than similarly introducing a high quality, retina-like display, it continued to use a subpixel-fudging, cost-effective PenTile screen on a larger device, hoping users would be impressed with pixel numbers rather than caring about how pixels or color on the screen actually looked.\nAs Rasmus Larsen noted at the time for FlatPanelsHD, \"a PenTile OLED panel was recently introduced with the Samsung Galaxy Note, and we were not impressed. In real world PenTile means loss of details and sharpness, as well as a bluish/greenish tint around letters (depending on the background color).\"\nThe site also called out Google's Samsung-built Galaxy Nexus, noting that \"the HD Super AMOLED display in the new Galaxy Nexus is not as awesome as it sounds\u2014 unfortunately. And the reason that people do not call it a Retina Display should seem much more obvious to you now that you know the underlying technical architecture.\"\nIn the years since, Apple brought its Retina Display to iPad and to its Mac lineup. TV makers have similarly advanced HDTV sets to support \"4K,\" making their displays four fold sharper in pixels rather than just larger. And of course, the smartphone industry now generally follows Apple in making sharper, not just larger, displays as well.\nWide Color: the new Retina Display of gamut\nOnce iPhone pixel density achieved Retina Display status, Apple didn't change it again until it introduced larger screen sizes. As Android vendors have learned the hard way, arbitrarily squeezing in \"even more pixels\" just for bragging rights results in a new problem: a huge increase in display processing tasks that slows everything down.\nWhile iPhone 4's Retina Display involved less than a half million pixels, today's largest iPhone 6/6s Plus has to wrangle over 2 million pixels. Higher end Androids\u2014 such as Samsung's Galaxy line\u2014 pack in nearly 3.7 million pixels into a similar screen size, but have historically opted to use a less powerful Application Processor, resulting in poor performance.\nRather than following Samsung in an underpowered, overspecced resolution numbers race, Apple has been working to improve future displays in ways that will actually matter to its users. One primary result is Wide Color, a new initiative to expand the color gamut of the display to cover more of visible color spectrum captured by digital cameras.\nThat not only requires new display hardware, but also requires sophisticated color management software. Apple first delivered Wide Color support in the 5K iMac. This year, it expanded support to the new 9.7 inch iPad Pro.\niPad Pro\nApple's new support for the DCI-P3 Wide Color Gamut results in an expanded ability to reproduce more accurate color than the existing \"Standard RGB\" can. The prevailing sRGB can't reproduce the most vibrant, vivid colors we can see. Interestingly, many cameras capture RAW color data that simply doesn't show up on today's sRGB displays.\nThe work Apple has done to support Wide Color in both hardware and software on its 5K iMac is really an expansion of its ColorSync color management software that already existed on Macs.\nHowever, bringing Wide Color to iPad Pro involved creating new software support for advanced color management in iOS, with backward compatibility to enable the existing library of App Store titles to continue to work, and new frameworks for developers to adopt to work with new 16-bit per color, Wide Color images.\nThe result of Apple's work on Wide Color on iPad Pro was hailed by Ray Soneira of DisplayMate back in March. He described it as offering the highest absolute color accuracy, the lowest screen reflectance for any mobile display, the highest peak brightness for any full-size tablet for any picture level, the highest contrast rating in ambient light and the smallest color variation with viewing angle.\nSoneira was impressed enough to predict that Apple could implement the same Wide Color gamut and anti-reflection coating of iPad Pro on iPhone 7, noting that this would improve its screen performance and readability in bright ambient light.\niPhone 7 display: True Tone & Wide Color\nApple pretty obviously didn't complete all its work on Wide Color just for one new model of iPad. Bringing support for Wide Color to iOS involved changes to UIKit, Core Animation, Core Graphics, Core Image, ImageIO, SceneKit, SpriteKit and WebKit\u2014 a major undertaking spanning much of the company's software groups.\nGiven the attention Apple devoted to Wide Color at WWDC, it seems quite clear that Apple will also bring Wide Color, and likely a True Tone display (like the new iPad Pro, below), to iPhone 7, resulting in more vibrant and accurate color display\u2014 in apps, on the web, and even for users' existing photos\u2014 that buyers will consider a significant advance and a reason for upgrading.\nTrue Tone display on the new iPad Pro\nBoth True Tone and Wide Color require extensive hardware and software integration to work. Like support for Retina Display, it also requires some attention from third party developers to make sure that the new changes are supported in their apps. That indicates that Google and its hardware partners will have a difficult path ahead in trying to close the color gap.\nThinking outside the dots\nToday, Android phone vendors hoping to stand out in a crowded market face a number of issues. Phone fragmentation\u2014 often related to the use of cheapest possible components\u2014 results in compatibility problems and makes it more difficult for Google, its hardware partners and mobile carriers to roll out new features or patch existing flaws.\nAs noted by Phil Nickinson of Android Central, Samsung's Galaxy S7\u2014 often talked about in the media as the equivalent to Apple's iPhone 6s\u2014 is actually a brand name applied to \"31 separate versions of the Galaxy S7\" that Samsung sells worldwide. Nickinson was writing about Android phone compatibility with Android Auto, Google's version of CarPlay; regarding the 31 slightly different Galaxy S7 models, he noted that \"Some work. And some don't.\"\n#CarPlay vs AAuto: \"there are 31 separate versions of the Samsung Galaxy S7 (worldwide). Some work. And some don't\" https://t.co/nqZ7c6BBGu \u2014 Daniel Eran Dilger (@DanielEran) July 4, 2016\nSamsung has also focused its attention on selling waterproofing claims that literally don't hold water. Joanna Stern of the Wall Street Journal attempted to carry that water herself in a piece that recommended phone buyers hold off on iPhones but not wait for a new Galaxy S7, specifically citing \"waterproofing\" as a key reason for buying a high end Samsung.\nHowever, both Square Trade and Consumer Reports have called out Samsung for inflating its claims of water resistance after testing multiple Galaxy S7 models that all failed to actually survive the dunk tank.",
