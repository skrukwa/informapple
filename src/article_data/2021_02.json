        "title": "What Apple Watch really needs is a battery that lasts longer than a day",
        "body": "More than steps, more than active minutes, I've been focused on making sure I get enough decent sleep each day. That's been an issue working from home for so much of 2020-2021. Apple's latest watch and WatchOS software focused, among other things, on adding sleep tracking that could help make bedtime schedules more regular. It sounds great. Except... the Apple Watch's battery life gets in the way.\nI could say that the Apple Watch needs new health sensors, or some other medically approved metric like blood pressure. (I have high blood pressure, so that would be nice, if unrealistic right now.) But really, first, it needs better battery life. Of all the fitness trackers and wearables I've alternated between over the last year -- the Oura Ring, Fitbit Sense, Amazon Halo band and Withings Scanwatch -- the Apple Watch has been dead last in battery life.\nYou, the Apple Watch owner, may say: charge it every day, no problem. It's not so easy when you're wearing it all night and supposedly tracking your sleep, though. The watch can run for a day and a half straight on a charge, in my experience, but then it's a matter of figuring out when that moment would be: while showering? While sitting at my desk? It needs at least half an hour to gather up a reasonable amount of charge.\nMore battery life isn't always the perfect answer, either. It's easy to lose track of how many nights more a ring or a watch can last. I find I miss a day or two of tracking with Fitbits, or Oura, or the Halo Band, or anything else that I don't charge daily. Still, having more days, or even hours, of battery life helps. Apple could incorporate a lower-power mode or a new chip that helps with battery. Or, maybe, put in a larger battery. Or add some sort of battery watchband, which would be the equivalent of that iPhone battery-bulge smart case.\nThat being said, don't expect a new watch until the fall, just like always. Apple did release its Apple Watch-connected Fitness Plus service last month, and maybe it has more connected services like that in store for 2021.\nI'll just say that the Apple Watch works pretty perfectly for me right now. Except for the battery life, of course.\nRead more: Tackling my lockdown weight gain with Apple Fitness Plus\nThere are lots of other ways the Apple Watch could improve. It could become a better remote for connecting to phones and computers. (I use the Camera remote all the time to start and stop self-shot videos, but I'd love more.) It should have some sort of biometrics, like Touch ID. It could have a real, true watch face store.\nI'd give those up for a better battery life. If the Apple Watch just gets one new thing in 2021, let it be that.",

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Reportedly Told Staff Facebook Needs to 'Inflict Pain' on Apple Over Privacy Dispute",
        "body": "Apple and Facebook have been in a very public spat over the course of the last few months as Apple dials up its pro-privacy stance. The two companies have long had tension, but more recently, Facebook is taking shots at an upcoming iOS and iPadOS feature that will require apps and data companies such as Facebook to ask for users' permission before tracking them across other sites and websites.\nWhile for the most part, the war of words between the tech titans has remained professional, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook have also shared a barrage of attacks toward each other. During a 2018 interview in the midst of Facebook's notorious Cambridge Analytica scandal, Cook was asked how he would lead Apple if it were to face a similar crisis. Cook responded by ruling the hypothetical situation out of the question, saying Apple would not be in the situation Facebook was in, thanks to its differing stance on privacy and user data. Zuckerberg shot back, calling Cook's comments on TV \"extremely glib\" and \"not at all aligned with the truth.\"\nZuckerberg, outraged by Cook's comments and public influence on Facebook's reputation, reportedly told internal aides and team members that Facebook needs to \"inflict pain\" on Apple, according to sources who spoke on anonymity to The Wall Street Journal. Last month, during the company's earnings call, Zuckerberg called Apple an increasingly bigger threat to Facebook and accused the Cupertino tech giant of using its platforms to interfere with how Facebook operates its own apps.\nThe day after the public comments, Cook responded indirectly in a speech during the Computers, Privacy, and Data Protection conference where he condemned Facebook and implied that its business model of maximizing engagement leads to division and violence. During the same speech, Cook censured Facebook's potential role in the January 6 U.S. Capitol riot, blaming the social media company's algorithms for spreading conspiracy theories.\nIn December, Facebook ran full-page ads attacking Apple's up-and-coming App Tracking Transparency (ATT) requirement that will force apps to ask for users' permission before tracking them across apps and the internet. Facebook is attacking Apple from the standpoint that ATT will hurt small businesses that rely on personalized ads derived from effective tracking. In response, Cook directly weighed in on Twitter, stating that Apple simply wants to give users a choice about whether they wish to be tracked or not.\nDespite the personal jabs and attacks, in a statement given to The Wall Street Journal, Facebook spokeswoman Dani Lever refuted the idea that the tension between the companies is personal, suggesting instead that it was \"about the future of the free internet.\" Facebook states that choosing between tracking users for personalized ads and protecting their privacy is a \"false-trade off,\" claiming that it believes it can provide both. The spokeswoman reiterated past remarks by Facebook stating that Apple's privacy features are not meant to preserve user privacy, but are instead about increasing profit, and that Facebook will join others to highlight Apple's \"self-preferencing, anticompetitive behavior.\"\nApple declined to comment on the report.\nFacebook is reportedly planning to take its disapproval with Apple to court, as it's allegedly been preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against the Cupertino-based tech company over its \"unfair\" approach to privacy with ATT and iMessage. As part of its lawsuit, Facebook is considering partnering with other companies such as Epic Games, which is already embroiled in a massive legal battle with Apple, to propel its antitrust case forward. Facebook may, however, scrap its plans to bring forward any form of legal action against Apple.\nSenator Mike Lee of Utah, who leads the Republicans' effort in the Senate antitrust subcommittee, told The \u200cWall Street Journal\u200c that the feud between Apple and Facebook sits at the \"nexus of privacy and antitrust,\" and that he doesn't want to \"impose regulation that just ends up protecting incumbents and entrenching monopolies.\"\nApple has committed to launching ATT with iOS and iPadOS 14.5 in the \"early spring\" and Facebook has seemingly admitted defeat in its failed attempt to stop the new requirement from going into action. Apps have the freedom to customize the prompt that users will receive asking for their permission to be tracked across other apps and the web, and screenshots of Facebook's prompt for its iOS app show that it pleads with users to opt in to tracking in order to receive \"a better ads experience.\"",

        "title": "Apple'e upcoming update let's you opt out of app tracking, Facebook isn't a fan",
        "body": "A privacy change coming to the software that powers Apple's popular iPhone has prompted a war of words in Silicon Valley.\nThe iPhone maker is expected to roll out an update to its iOS 14 operating system next week that prompts you to give apps permission to track their activity across other apps and the web. That change, which Apple calls App Tracking Transparency, may seem small. Lots of apps already track our web activity through default settings we accept when we install them.\nFacebook, however, has been fuming about the change, which threatens the source of its $86 billion in annual revenue: targeted ads. The social network has waged a months-long campaign against Apple, running full-page ads in national newspapers and testing pop-ups inside the Facebook app to encourage users to accept its tracking. It's also alleged that Apple's changes are designed to help the iPhone maker's own business, rather than protect consumer privacy.\n\"Apple may say that they're doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track their competitive interests,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the change is rooted in the company's belief that \"users should have the choice over the data that is being collected about them and how it's used.\"\nThe dispute underscores a fundamental difference between the tech giants: how they make money. Apple sells smartphones and laptops and takes a cut of fees charged to app developers. Facebook sells ads that it can target precisely based on the trove of data it collects on its 2.8 billion monthly users. Those business models inform their approach to privacy.\nHere's what you need to know about the fight between Apple and Facebook:\nI've got the basic idea. But would you go back to the beginning?\nSure. It's complicated and it's been a slow boil. Apple said at its annual developers conference in June that it would introduce a feature to iOS that required users to give apps permission to track them across various apps and websites. Like we've said, this is a common practice, but users are often unaware of it because it's buried in the terms of service or privacy policies. Who reads those?\nWith the iOS update, iPhone users will see a pop-up that explicitly says an app wants to track them. App developers can use this pop-up to explain how user data will be used. Facebook, for example, uses this data to show people personalized ads.\nThe pop-up will also give users a chance to opt out of tracking. Many probably will.\n\"Tracking refers to the act of linking user or device data collected from your app with user or device data collected from other companies' apps, websites, or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. Tracking also refers to sharing user or device data with data brokers,\" Apple explained to developers in a blog post about the iOS 14 updates.\nHow could this change affect me?\nDepends how often you look at advertisements. If you don't deal with them very often, you probably won't notice much of a change by opting out of tracking.\nIf you rely on Facebook's advertising to direct you to services and products you buy, expect the ads you see to be less relevant if you opt out.\nThe prompt will also give you a sense of which apps are tracking you across other apps and websites to serve you ads.\nHow did Facebook respond to the upcoming change?\nFacebook was clearly unhappy with Apple, and the company made that known publicly. The social network ran full-page newspaper ads in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Washington Post arguing that Apple's update will harm small businesses and consumers. The social network's claims have been challenged by academics. (More about that below.)\nThe social network also launched a website where small businesses could share their stories. The page includes videos from small business owners who support personalized ads and encourages others to tell their story by using #SpeakUpforSmall. Many of these small businesses say they rely on social media ads to attract more customers.\nWatch this: Facebook slams Apple's privacy changes, FTC requests data collection information from social media 01:28\nFacebook's arguments also reflect its own interest in the effects of the change, which will surely weigh on its revenue. During its fourth-quarter earnings call, Zuckerberg repeatedly revisited the topic and complained about Apple.\n\"We have a lot of competitors who make claims about privacy that are often misleading,\" he said. He added that Facebook, which has its own messaging service, Messenger, and which also owns WhatsApp , sees Apple as a competitor because of the popularity of iMessage.\nDan Levy, who runs Facebook's ad business, said in a blog post that Apple's policy change is \"about profit, not privacy.\" He said the iOS change would force some apps to turn to in-app purchases and subscription fees, from which Apple can take a cut of up to 30%. (Apple launched a new program earlier this year to reduce the commission to 15% for small businesses with proceeds of up to $1 million per year.)\nFacebook has a poor track record when it comes to user privacy, and it seems unlikely that users will give it permission to track them. The company's reputation for protecting privacy was tarnished by the 2018 scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a UK political consulting firm that harvested the data of up to 87 million users without their permission.\nZuckerberg defends Facebook's business model, saying ads allow the social network to offer the site to users for free. \"If we're committed to serving everyone, then we need a service that is affordable to everyone,\" he said in a 2019 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal.\nWhat's Apple's argument?\nApple says its changes give users more control over their data and transparency into what is collected.\n\"If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, it does not deserve our praise,\" Cook said during a speech last month in a thinly veiled jab at Facebook. \"It deserves reform.\"\nThe view isn't new. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Cook told tech journalist Kara Swisher and MSNBC's Chris Hayes that \"if our customer was our product, we could make a ton of money. We've elected not to do that.\"\nIs Facebook overreacting?\nIt depends on who you ask. Facebook says in its blog post that \"without personalized ads powered by their own data, small businesses could see a cut of over 60% of website sales from ads.\"\nThe Harvard Business Review says Facebook's findings are \"misleading\" and suggests the impact will be modest. \"These customers would have generated high revenues anyway,\" the Review found. \"That's why they were targeted in the first place. So it would be a mistake to conclude that these customers spent more because of the personalized ads.\"\nCook has also pointed out that Facebook can still track users. It just needs to get their permission first.\nFacebook isn't alone in cautioning that the changes could harm their ad sales. Snapchat expressed support for Apple's changes, but CFO Derek Andersen said during its earnings call that the change represents \"a risk of interruption\" to demand for advertising. Twitter suggested in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter that the changes could have a modest impact on its performance but didn't elaborate.",

        "title": "Apple Wins Patent for iPhone Display With Variable Refresh Rates Up to 240Hz",
        "body": "A new Apple patent published today by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office describes an iPhone display that, with high refresh mode enabled, may be capable of updating content at two times, three times, or even four times the native refresh rate, as reported by Patently Apple. For example, an \u200ciPhone\u200c with a 60Hz display would be able to increase its variable refresh rate to 120Hz, 180Hz, or 240Hz automatically.\nFor those unfamiliar, refresh rate refers to how many times a display refreshes every second. (The higher the refresh rate, the smoother the content on the display will be.) All current iPhones have a refresh rate of 60Hz, but since 2017, all iPad Pro models have featured ProMotion technology, enabling a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz.\nRumors of 120Hz coming to the iPhone 12 proved to be untrue, but there is renewed confidence that ProMotion will make an appearance on the iPhone 13. During the rumor cycle last year, some claimed that the \u200ciPhone 12\u200c would automatically switch between 60Hz and 120Hz depending on what the user was doing on their device in an effort to preserve battery life. While the ability for a device to switch between 60Hz and 120Hz is not new, the patent describing the ability for an \u200ciPhone\u200c to push the refresh rate to as high as 180Hz or 240Hz is.\nThe lack of a 120Hz refresh rate on the \u200ciPhone\u200c so far could be linked to the fact that Apple tends to treads carefully when adding features such as ProMotion that could be detrimental to battery life or systemwide performance. Rumors suggest that Apple will overcome this power consumption dilemma by adopting low-power LTPO display technology for iPhone 13 models, allowing for 120Hz without a significant impact on battery life.\nA higher refresh rate could be beneficial for several use cases, such as gaming and augmented reality. If a user is simply watching a movie or messaging a friend, the display could switch back to its 60Hz native refresh rate as a means to save battery life.\nThis week, new rumors claimed that alongside a 120Hz refresh rate, the \u200ciPhone 13\u200c lineup will also have an always-on-display. Always-on displays allow users to see certain information, such as the time, date, or battery life, at all times. All high-end iPhones since the \u200ciPhone\u200c X have featured OLED displays, meaning each pixel is individually controlled, allowing the device to only light up the pixels needed to show users limited information, preserving battery life.",

        "title": "Apple overtook Samsung to become the largest smartphone vendor worldwide in the fourth quarter",
        "body": "Apple overtook Samsung to become the largest smartphone vendor worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2020, a feat not achieved by Apple since 2016, according to market data by Gartner.\nIn the final quarter of 2020, Apple sold 80 million new iPhones, largely driven by the launch of the first 5G-enabled iPhone series. Anshul Gupta, Senior Research Director at Gartner, says that 5G and improved camera features helped convince customers to upgrade to iPhone 12 models in the final quarter of the year.\nEven as consumers remained cautious in their spending and held off on some discretionary purchases, 5G smartphones and pro-camera features encouraged some end users to purchase new smartphones or upgrade their current smartphones in the quarter.\nCompared to 2019, Apple sold more than 10 million extra iPhones in the fourth quarter and saw its global smartphone market share increase by almost 15%. Samsung, the closest rival to Apple, saw its market share decrease by 11.8% and sold around eight million fewer devices compared to just one year ago, according to the market data.\nApple's near 15% increase in market share yielded it an \"upgrade super-cycle,\" according to Annette Zimmerman, the lead analyst for Apple at Gartner, quoted by the Financial Times. In Q1 of 2021, Apple saw its largest number of \u200ciPhone\u200c upgrades ever, according to CEO Tim Cook. The \u200ciPhone\u200c alone generated more than $65 billion in revenue for the first quarter of the year.\nFor the greater picture, however, global smartphone sales decreased by 12.5% in 2020. Out of the top five smartphone makers, Apple and Xiaomi were the only two unscathed by the global decline in sales. Apple's growth comes despite the fact that it launched its \u200ciPhone 12\u200c series out of the normal September timeframe due to the global health crisis.\nAcross the board, the accelerated growth of 5G adoption around the world drove up demand for 5G compatible smartphones. In a year stricken by economic difficulties, consumers were looking for lower-end, affordable 5G smartphones, instead of higher-end models with price tags of up to $1,500. On that front, the iPhone 12 mini, despite reports of it performing poorly relative to other \u200ciPhone 12\u200c models, likely helped Apple overtake Samsung thanks to its small form factor and relatively affordable $699 price tag.\nLooking further ahead into 2021, Gartner expects that the availability of lower-end 5G smartphones, such as the \u200ciPhone 12 mini\u200c, will be a \"deciding factor for end users to upgrade their existing smartphones.\" Apple is expected to continue the \"mini\" model for next year's model, and the entire iPhone 13 lineup is rumored to feature an under-the-screen Touch ID sensor, always-on-display, and improved cameras.",

        "title": "Apple cracks down on apps with \u2018irrationally high prices\u2019 as App Store scams are exposed",
        "body": "App Store scams have recently resurfaced as a developer exposed several scam apps in the App Store making millions of dollars per year. Most of these apps exploit fake ratings and reviews to show up in search results and look legit, but trick users into getting subscriptions at irrationally high prices.\nIt looks like Apple has started to crack down on scam attempts by rejecting apps that look like they have subscriptions or other in-app purchases with prices that don\u2019t seem reasonable to the App Review team.\n9to5Mac obtained access to a rejection email shared by a developer that provides a subscription service through their app. It shows a rejection message from Apple telling them that their app would not be approved because the prices of their in-app purchase products \u201cdo not reflect the value of the features and content offered to the user.\u201d Apple\u2019s email goes as far as calling it a \u201crip-off to customers\u201d (you can read the full letter at the end of this post).\nWe were initially skeptical about the veracity of this email given some of the wording choices, but looking through Apple\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines, it\u2019s possible to find the term \u201crip-off\u201d at least twice, such as in section 3, where Apple states that \u201cwe won\u2019t distribute apps and in-app purchase items that are clear rip-offs.\u201d\nIn contact with the developer of the rejected app, we were able to verify the authenticity of the rejection email from Apple. Unfortunately in this case, it seems clear that the rejection was a mistake. The developer was able to work with the app review team and eventually got their app approved by explaining that the subscription price was justified because the app employed paid APIs to perform its tasks. Just as with many other items in the guidelines, it\u2019s possible for the review team at Apple to encounter false positives that lead to wrongful rejections of apps, which highlights why moderating the App Store is such a complicated task.\nThis rule has been in place for a long time, so it\u2019s unclear when Apple started enforcing it more rigorously. A quick Google search turns up a few results in the Apple Developer Forums with similar phrasing to this email going as far back as October 2020. It\u2019s possible that recent issues with scams being exposed in the App Store have caused Apple to change its review policies to look at the prices of subscriptions and other in-app purchases more closely before approving an app.\nWe reached out to Apple for more information on these practices. The company reiterated its commitment to keeping the App Store a safe place for users to discover and download apps, and that app review rejects apps that attempt to scam or rip off users, based on section 3 of the review guidelines.\nHere\u2019s the full rejection letter from Apple:\nCustomers expect the App Store to be a safe and trusted marketplace for purchasing digital goods. Apps should never betray this trust by attempting to rip-off or cheat users in any way. Unfortunately, the prices you\u2019ve selected for your app or in-app purchase products in your app do not reflect the value of the features and content offered to the user. Charging irrationally high prices for content or services with limited value is a rip-off to customers and is not appropriate for the App Store. Specifically, the prices for the following items are irrationally high: \u2013 (redacted) Next Steps To resolve this issue, we recommend you take the following steps: \u2013 Revise your app or in-app purchase products to provide more value to the user at the time of purchase\n\u2013 Choose a price for your app or in-app purchase products that accurately reflects the value being provided to the user\n\u2013 Once you\u2019ve made appropriate changes, resubmit your app for review The next submission of this app may require a longer review time, and it won\u2019t be eligible for an expedited review until this issue is resolved.\nThanks to Ilia Kukharev and Radomir Novkovich for their help.",

        "title": "Valve Ordered to Give Apple Information on 436 Steam Games As Part of Epic Games Legal Case",
        "body": "Valve, the makers behind popular game distribution platform Steam, will be forced to hand over aggregate historical sales, price, and other information on 436 games hosted on the store to Apple, as part of the Apple vs. Epic Games antitrust case.\nAs reported in a paywalled report by Law360, during a virtual discovery hearing on Wednesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas S. Hixson ordered that Apple's subpoena for the data to Valve was valid, however, noted that Apple has \"salted the earth with subpoenas,\" telling Valve \"don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not just you.\" Apple's original subpoena requested data from Valve about Steam dating as far back as 2015, the judge's ruling however will only require Valve to produce data limited to as early as 2017.\n\u200cEpic Games\u200c is in a heated legal battle with Apple over the App Store and claims that the Cupertino tech-giant locks developers into its ecosystem, and forces them to pay a \"30% tax\" for in-app purchases. Apple's subpoena for data from Valve is one of many that Apple has set forward as it attempts to prove its point that the \u200cApp Store\u200c as a distribution platform for software is no different than others.\nGavin W. Stok, a lawyer representing Valve in the discovery hearing, urged Judge Hixson to reject the subpoena and not force his company to produce the data. Stok says that Valve is run by a small team and that collecting all the data Apple is requesting would require it to \"dedicate multiple employees working full time,\" and that it would not be able to guarantee the request could be met on time.\nApple's lawyer, Jay P. Srinivasan, says that the request is doable, and points out that Apple could have requested data on all 30,000 games on the Steam store, but that it instead is only requesting data on 436 games. Apple continued to defend its subpoena, calling Valve a \"prominent player\" in the complete picture of relevant markets like the \u200cApp Store\u200c.\nAhead of what is expected to be a heated court hearing set for July 2021 between Apple and \u200cEpic Games\u200c, Valve has until mid-March to produce the data. We've reached out to Valve for a comment on the judge's ruling and will update the page once we hear back.",

        "title": "You can disable Reddit's maddening 'Open in app' popup once and for all",
        "body": "Reddit's mobile website is pretty well made, fast, and responsive \u2014 if it wasn't for the pesky \"See this post in ... Reddit App\" popup that slides up from the bottom every time you open a Reddit link someone sent you. But it turns out there's a way to get rid of it, and it was hidden right under our noses the whole time.\nTo disable the prompt, just visit the mobile Reddit website like you usually would, and then tap the three-lines menu in the top right corner and select Settings. In there, you can turn on the night mode, but most importantly, you can uncheck a box labeled \"Ask to Open in App.\" Do that, and in the future, you'll no longer run into the pesky app popup. As a bonus, you might notice that the \"Use App\" advert in the top bar also disappears from the website afterwards.\nThere are a few limitations, though. Even if you're logged in to your Reddit account, the state of the checkmark isn't automatically synced across all other browsers you use on your devices. It's only stored locally in a cookie, so as soon as you clear your browsing data, you'll have to tick the checkmark again. The trick also doesn't work at all for Reddit AMP pages that typically appear in Google search results or the Google Discover feed, unfortunately.\nClose\nLeft: Popup upon page load. Middle: Deactivating the checkbox. Right: No more popup!\nIf you're a die-hard Reddit user, you probably already know about this trick (there are reports on it from a few years ago), but for regulars like me, discovering this checkmark is a godsend, and we hope this trick helps a few of you out. It's actually fascinating that Reddit has added an option to turn off the prompt in the first place. It shows that while it wants as many people as possible using its app (50+ million at the moment), it's still willing to give those of us who really don't want it a chance to browse the mobile site in peace.",

        "body": "Apple last week released beta versions of upcoming iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 updates to developers and public beta testers, and among a number of new features, Apple has added the ability to set a default music streaming service when using Siri to play songs.\nImage via Reddit user matejamm1\nFirst spotted by Reddit users , the first time you ask \u200cSiri\u200c to play a song in iOS 14.5, you are given the option to choose from a list of installed third-party music streaming apps in addition to Apple Music\nAfter an app is selected, \u200cSiri\u200c defaults to the service thereafter whenever it is asked to play a song. So for example, if Spotify is selected and you say \"Hey \u200cSiri\u200c, play Moonlight Drive by The Doors,\" you no longer have to specify \"...on Spotify\" to prevent it from trying to play the track in \u200cApple Music\u200c.\nAs noted by The 8-Bit, \u200cSiri\u200c will also set a music streaming service as the default if you ask it to play from that particular app for the first time.\nAccording to users who have played with the feature, it only works with specific phrases at the moment, and sometimes revert back to \u200cApple Music\u200c, so it sounds like there's still some work to do on Apple's end before it's fully consistent.\niOS 14.5 is the biggest update to iOS 14 to date, introducing several significant new features, including the ability to unlock your iPhone using an Apple Watch when wearing a mask. Be sure to check out our dedicated iOS 14.5 guide for all the details and what you can expect when it's officially released.",

        "title": "Of the 86 Google apps on the iOS App Store, just 3 have been updated in 2021",
        "body": "Google\u2019s privacy standoff with Apple has lasted so long that even the company\u2019s own apps are complaining about it.\nSince early December, Apple has required any iOS app to include a privacy \u201cnutrition label\u201d, listing all the ways the app uses personal data.\nThose labels, which are written by the app developers, range from short and sweet \u2013 the podcast app Overcast, for instance, lists six uses of personal data, from usage information for analytics to user IDs for the app\u2019s sign-in functionality \u2013 to somewhat longer. Facebook lists 80 different data categories it uses, for purposes from tracking users around the web to personalising the app.\nGoogle, however, has yet to provide its own labels. The company only has to do so when it updates its apps, which it stopped doing late last year. The iOS version of Google Chrome, for instance, was updated roughly every two weeks throughout 2020, until two months ago when it received its last update. Google Photos was updated almost weekly until two months ago; so too were YouTube, Google Maps and Gmail.\nIn fact, of the 86 apps Google has published on the iOS App Store, only three \u2013 Google Slides, Google Play Music and TV, and Google Translate \u2013 have been updated in 2021. Of those three, just one \u2013 Google Translate \u2013 has a privacy label, which lists 25 ways personal data may be used.\nThe vast majority of the remaining 83 apps received their most recent update two months ago, shortly before the new requirements came into effect.\nOn Wednesday night, Google\u2019s apps began to complain about the lack of updates. According to user reports posted on social media, a number of apps including Gmail, Google Maps and Google Photos issued notices warning their users that the app was \u201cout of date\u201d, despite the fact the users were on the latest version.\n\u201cYou should update this app,\u201d the warning read. \u201cThe version you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t include the latest security features to keep you protected. Only continue if you understand the risks.\u201d\nGoogle was unable to immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian , but a spokesperson told the tech site The Verge that the error message was a \u201cbug\u201d. Others such as the TechMeme editor, Spencer Dailey, speculated that the \u201cbug\u201d was in fact \u201can automatic check of how long it has been since the app was last updated\u201d, which was not expected to be triggered since in normal times a two month-old version of the app would definitely be out of date.\nGoogle will shortly face further pressures from Apple\u2019s privacy push. In a forthcoming update to iOS, a new feature called \u201cApp Tracking Transparency\u201d will require applications to ask for permission before they are able to track users around the web. The setting has sparked strong pushback from Facebook, which argues it will hurt online advertising, but to date Google has been quiet about how it intends to respond to the requirement.",

        "title": "Insultingly, Facebook continues to try to convince users that privacy-violating targeted ads are good",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nCredit: Facebook\nSomewhere along the line, Facebook moved from being the preposterously insecure social media service, into a corporation whose people seem pretty insecure \u2014 which has been further demonstrated by the company on Thursday trying its latest attempt to convince people how privacy-breaking targeted advertisements are actually good for consumers.\nOn Thursday, we are yet again seeing a Facebook blogging tirade where the company wants to be seen as our lone champion against \u2014 well, anything it can grab on to. If you can't be bothered to read this latest diatribe, the short version is that the company appears to believe that we need our online habits tracked in order to provide us with more ads, and we should be thankful that Facebook gives us that.\nThe even shorter version is that there's no difference from the last tirade \u2014 except that the new blog has an accompanying ad campaign. It doesn't matter - Facebook knows you won't read it anyway.\nYou, specifically you, the reader of this piece, will not do anything more than glance at this nonsense from Facebook and you will not be fooled by what is patently false \u2014 but you're not the audience for these missives.\nFacebook has written off the audience that understands what it's doing, or which is interested enough to find out. It's probably right to figure out that we're all going to carry on using the service, but just in case, it is aiming very squarely at the audience who does not want to think about it.\nHence the previous newspaper ads, read only by people who are involved in regulation. Hence the mutterings about taking Apple to court, believed only by people who hate Apple.\nHence, too, Facebook's loud attack which comes over as deeply insecure defense. The fact is that if you know one single thing about privacy, you are not going to be supporting Facebook.\nIt's not about the technology facts\nFacebook knows it has lost the generally tech-savvy on privacy grounds. There's no putting the genie back in the bottle, there's no convincing you that they are for our good.\nBut there is plenty of room to tell everybody else that this is really a very simple story of good versus evil, and Facebook is somehow maintaining that it is the good guy with a straight face. Facebook will not shut up about how it is the sole champion of all small businesses, even as that is not true, because everybody cares about small business owners.\nFacebook will not even whisper about the only absolutely true thing in its entire campaign, that it's afraid for its own profits.\nWe all support the idea of people building a business out of nothing but then once they've done it, few worry too much about its bottom line. Facebook just makes it harder than ever to care about its income when it is quite plain that it does not care about us.\nRight back at the very start, when Mark Zuckerberg started \"The Facebook\" in Harvard, he described all users as being \"dumb f***s.\" He's since said he regrets it, but if he ever genuinely changed his mind about us, the new tirades suggest he's changed it right back.\nIn its quest to look like the good guy, Facebook is repeating statistics that have been disproven. But, it doesn't care because if it keeps saying them, enough people will believe.\nThat does not include the tech savvy, but it does include the kind of America that doesn't live in technology, that doesn't follow its every move. That audience is the one most likely to stay with Facebook, so long as Facebook can persuade enough of them that it's a good guy.\nFacebook's privacy notice in the App Store\nFacebook has always regarded its users with some level of disdain, but now it's vastly more blatant about it than ever. The tirades against Apple's privacy seem panicked, like a politician knowing he's about to be caught doing something incredibly stupid, and tries diverting attention.\nThe fact that Facebook now so very loudly does not want you thinking about what it does, is making more people think about it. And you cannot think about Facebook's business model for one instant without being uncomfortable about it.\nSo there's Facebook, forever disdaining us, now making us uncomfortable. And there's Facebook, blackmailing Australia and showing the rest of the world that it's ready to put charities in jeopardy unless it gets its way.\nAnd then there's Apple. While we admit this is part of Apple's entire marketing schtick, Tim Cook and Apple keeps telling us about privacy and giving us an informed choice of what we do or don't want to accept as it pertains to our habits, our information, and what we do on the internet.\nApple is using privacy to sell its devices, and Facebook is using its total absence of privacy to sell us to advertisers. And to line its own pockets. Even Google has a better privacy record than Facebook does.\nYet it truly does seem as if companies have personalities. Apple is an adult, and puts that foot forward, whether you agree with what it does or not. Facebook has the temperament of a child, whatever it does \u2014 and most particularly when it gets caught with its hand in the cookie jar.",

        "title": "iPhone 12 mini May Stop Getting Produced in Q2, 2021 Due to Seemingly Weak Demand",
        "body": "The iPhone 12 mini is Apple\u2019s gift to consumers who wanted a powerful and compact device that could probably last them several years. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s a massive market for a model like this, and due to weak demand for it, Apple\u2019s supply chain will reportedly stop producing it in the second quarter of 2021.\nLarger iPhone 12 Models Will Offset the Weak Demand for iPhone 12 mini as Shipments Appear to Have Picked up Drastically\nWilliam Yang, an analyst at JP Morgan, believes that Apple\u2019s supply chain will stop producing the iPhone 12 mini in the second quarter of 2021 due to weak demand. His predictions could stem from previous data, which shows that the larger iPhone 12 models are selling far better than the 5.4-inch counterpart. In fact, a report from Morgan Stanley stated that Apple cut iPhone 12 mini production by two million due to weak demand and focused on the iPhone 12 Pro thanks to its upward momentum.\nPrevious data has also shown the iPhone 12 mini to be the worst-selling model out of the four in the U.S. from the October to November period. Another reason the iPhone 12 mini may not have sat well with consumers is due to Apple\u2019s other and less expensive offerings. Starting from only $399, you have the 2020 iPhone SE and the iPhone 11, which starts from $599. Their competitive pricing has made both devices immensely popular, as they accounted for more than 50 percent of all iPhone sales in the U.S. for Q3, 2020.\nUnfortunately, their popularity might also have eaten into iPhone 12 mini sales, and there\u2019s no telling if this will have an adverse impact on the iPhone 13 mini expected later this year. Yes, that\u2019s correct, according to a previous report, Apple will reportedly unveil four new iPhone 13 models, with all four maintaining the same display sizes as their direct predecessors. We\u2019re unsure if Apple has informed suppliers to produce iPhone 13 mini units conservatively, but previous estimates reveal the upcoming lineup will be a home run for the company.\nYang predicts Apple could ship between 80 to 90 million iPhone 13 units in 2021 alone but didn\u2019t provide an estimated breakdown of each model. Looks like we\u2019re going to have to wait for more data down the road. While we do that, let us know down in the comments if you think it\u2019s a good idea for Apple\u2019s supply chain to stop producing the iPhone 12 mini.\nNews Source: AppleInsider",

        "title": "Chrome Used 10X More RAM Than Safari on macOS Big Sur in Recent Test",
        "body": "Under normal and lightweight web browsing, Google Chrome uses 10x more RAM than Safari on macOS Big Sur, according to a test conducted by Flotato creator Morten Just (via iMore).\nIn a blog post, Just outlines that he put both browsers to the test in two scenarios on the latest version of macOS. The first test was conducted on a virtual machine, and the second on a 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro with 32GB of RAM. In the first round of testing, Just simulated a typical browsing pattern of opening Twitter, scrolling around, and then opening a new tab with Gmail and composing an email.\nUnder that test, Just found that Chrome reached 1GB of RAM usage, while Safari used only 80MB of RAM. The two-tab test was only the start, however.\nWith 54 tabs open, Just found that Google Chrome used 24x more RAM per tab compared to Safari. Both browsers, according to Just, were free of any extensions, and this specific test was conducted on his actual MacBook Pro, not a virtual machine. Per his findings, Chrome used 290MB of RAM per open tab, while Safari only used 12MB of RAM per open tab.\nWhile the results are stark, Just does say that Google Chrome is likely \"going out of its way to manage its memory usage across tabs,\" in efforts to keep the current tab \"fast and responsive.\" In his tests, Just finds that his own application, Flotato, a lightweight alternative to Chrome that creates apps based on webpages, used significantly less RAM than both Safari and Chrome.\nChrome is known to being a memory hog on Mac and Windows computers, an issue Google has recently attempted to solve.\nWith macOS Big Sur, Safari received significant updates that saw it further outpace Chrome. Apple says that Safari on macOS Big Sur is \"50% faster on average at loading frequently visited websites than Chrome,\" and that Safari provides up to one and a half hours longer of streaming video, and up to one hour longer normal web browsing on a single charge, compared to Chrome and Firefox.\nUpdate: There are comments suggesting that these measurements may not be accurate. We'll provide further updates as more information comes out.",

The return of an SD card reader was first reported by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman last month.\n\"We predict that Apple's two new MacBook Pro models in 2H21 will have several significant design and specification changes,\" wrote Kuo. \"Some of the practical changes for users are equipping with the SD card reader and HDMI port.\"\nLast month, Kuo said Apple is planning all-new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with several changes, including the return of the classic MagSafe charging connector with a breakaway power cable, the removal of the Touch Bar, a new flat-edged design, and the return of more ports built into the notebooks for expanded connectivity. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman echoed many of these details in his reporting.\nKuo said Taiwan's Genesys Logic will be the exclusive supplier of the SD card reader in the 2021 MacBook Pro models.",

        "title": "Facebook's anti-Apple campaign uses misleading figures",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nCredit: Facebook\nTwo marketing professionals have accused Facebook of using \"cherry-picked\" data and \"disinformation\" in its campaign against Apple and iOS 14's privacy features.\nAs Facebook continues to claim that Apple's privacy features will be \"devastating\" to small businesses, the figures it quotes have come under question. Facebook is accused of using misleading data, altering figures, and spreading \"disinformation.\"\nWriting in the Harvard Business Review, two academic marketing professionals say they examined the specific claims and found multiple problems that mean numbers were overstated.\nThis includes Facebook's specific claim that the \"average small business advertiser stands to see a cut of over 60% in their sales for every dollar.\"\nBart de Langhe, associate professor of marketing at Barcelona's Ramon Llull University, and Stefano Puntoni, professor marketing at Erasmus University, Rotterdam, call this figure \"eye-popping.\" They say it comes from comparing the difference between having personalized advertising, and not.\n\"The problem with the 60% figure is that Facebook doesn't report anything about the two kinds of campaigns it was comparing,\" they write. \"For all we know, they might involve different industries, different companies, different products, different times, different places \u2014 and if they did, then Facebook's comparison wouldn't mean much.|\n\"In fact, it might just show that companies who knew their customers well achieved a higher return on advertising spend than companies that didn't,\" they continued.\nThe Harvard Business Review writers take particular exception to Facebook's claim that Apple's privacy move is especially damaging as it comes during the coronavirus pandemic. \"Forty-four percent of small to medium businesses started or increased their usage of personalized ads on social media during the pandemic,\" Facebook has said, \"according to a new Deloitte study.\"\n\"That number seemed off to us,\" write the marketing experts, \"so we took a close look at the Deloitte study \u2014 and discovered that Facebook reported the number incorrectly.\"\nDeloitte had asked companies from nine industries whether they increased their use of personalized or targeted ads during the pandemic. \"The industry with the largest increase was Telecom & Technology,\" reports Harvard Business Review, \"but the increase was only 34%.\"\n\"Facebook, it seems, cherry-picked the data that best supported its case,\" they write, \"and then increased the size of the cherries it picked by a third.\"\nFacebook is already testing users' reactions to privacy tracking\nThe experts want to stress that they are not dismissing the concerns of small businesses, nor saying Facebook has no right to argue the case. \"But disinformation about advertising effectiveness isn't the way to do that,\" they conclude.\nFacebook has not commented on the report. However, it has recently said it will have to comply with Apple's privacy stance \u2014 although it is claimed that Facebook is considering taking Apple to court over it.",

This is expected to be a virtual event broadcast to the public.\nThe publication\u2019s sources are only Twitter posts, but this is, at the very least, a reasonable guess. Apple unveiled the 2020 iPad Pro series on March 18, for example. That said, similar events arrived later on the calendar in previous years. In 2019, the date was March 25.

Numerous sources say these tablets will arrive that month.\nThis is not expected to be a complete redesign. However, the upgraded tablet could sport a mini-LED display, improving the screen visuals. And the series likely will include the first 5G iPad. The tablets also might come with additional built-in magnets for new accessories.\nFans of smaller tablets should keep an eye out for the 2020 iPad mini, which could be in for dramatic changes. Screen bezels could shrink significantly, supposedly allowing the display to increase to more than 9 inches.\nA \u201cone more thing\u201d tacked on the end of the Apple March event could be AirTags. Rumors of these item trackers have been circulating since 2019, but they could finally be about to launch.

        "title": "Facebook hates Apple's new privacy feature \u2014 here's how App Tracking Transparency works",
        "body": "Apple (AAPL) is gearing up to launch a new privacy feature in the next version of iOS 14 that is generating quite a bit of anger from the likes of fellow Silicon Valley titan Facebook.\nThe feature, called App Tracking Transparency, has become such a flashpoint between the companies that Facebook (FB ) is, according to The Information, considering filing an antitrust suit against Apple over the matter. That comes as the social media giant is already supporting Epic Games\u2019 own antitrust suit against the iPhone maker.\nSo what is App Tracking Transparency, and why does Facebook hate it so much? I\u2019ve got you covered.\nWhat is App Tracking Transparency?\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. Your iOS and iPadOS devices have what\u2019s called an Identification for Advertisers software tracker, or IDFA. An IDFA is Apple\u2019s randomized identifier that allows advertisers to track your activity across apps and the web without pulling in your personal information.\nTracking your activity is important for advertisers, because it enables them to send you targeted advertisements and determine how successful their advertising campaigns are. So if you are looking at a lot of pet-related websites, IDFA can help advertisers send you ads related to pet food or toys.\nFacebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg have been pushing hard against Apple's new privacy feature, saying it will hurt advertisers and businesses. (AP Foto/Mark Lennihan, Archivo)\nApple, however, has been pushing privacy as part of its product line for the last few years, and previously made moves to limit the ability of companies to track certain user activities via its Safari browser.\nThat\u2019s where App Tracking Transparency comes in. The feature, when made available with the next version of iOS 14, will provide users with a pop up when they launch an app that wants to track their activities. The feature also keeps tracking turned off by default, and will only let you be tracked if you tell the app to.\nCurrently, app tracking is turned on by default, though users can disable it via the iOS and iPadOS settings menus. Facebook fears that keeping tracking off by default and asking people to turn it on will result in large numbers of users rejecting being tracked.\nStory continues\nWhy is that a problem for Facebook?\nFacebook generates the vast majority of its revenue through, you guessed it, advertising. If companies can\u2019t target ads, they may not buy as many ads. What\u2019s more, according to Facebook\u2019s own research, companies that advertise with Facebook could see their revenue drop by as much as 50% when App Tracking Transparency is implemented.\nFacebook has fired back, though, in a big way. The company, according to reports, is considering filing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple over App Tracking Transparency, claiming that Apple is only making the move to fill its own coffers.\nFacebook says that if people choose not to be tracked, the effectiveness of targeted ads will plummet. That, according to Facebook, would force app developers who offer their apps for free by subsidizing them with ad sales to begin charging for their apps and in-app purchases.\nApple charges a 30% fee for apps purchased through its App Store, the only way to get apps on iPhones or iPads, meaning, according to Facebook, Apple would benefit from those new app charges.\nWhat does this mean for you?\nNothing yet, but Apple\u2019s update that includes App Tracking Transparency will be available soon, the company says. Whether you want to be tracked or not is entirely up to you. You\u2019ll still be served ads regardless. What changes is whether the ads are something that appeals to you or not.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter\nYahoo Finance Tech\nGot a tip?

        "body": "Apple has released a new watchOS update today that aims to avoid an issue that causes the Watch Series 5 and SE to stop charging. But if you\u2019re unfortunate enough to already be experiencing this problem, then you could be eligible for a free repair.\nAccording to an Apple support document, a small number of customers have encountered a situation where the aforementioned watches refuse to charge after entering Power Reserve mode (otherwise known as a low-power mode). The latest watchOS 7.3.1 is said to prevent this from happening.\nHowever if you\u2019re already affected and the update doesn\u2019t fix it, then Apple suggests you place your watch on your charger and wait for at least 30 minutes. If it still won\u2019t charge, then Apple recommends contacting Apple Support so that it can arrange a mail-in repair for you, absolutely free of charge. Do note however that Apple will still have to examine your watch to see if it\u2019s eligible for the free repair.",

        "title": "Music streaming services pay $424 million in licensing fees, $163 million coming from Apple",
        "body": "The Mechanical Licensing Collective (The MLC) announced today that it has received a total of $424,384,787 in licensing fees from all music streaming services, which includes Apple Music, Spotify, and Amazon Music. Apple was responsible for $163,338,890 \u2014 which is the largest amount paid by all companies.\nThe MLC calls this \u201caccrued historical unmatched royalties from digital service providers.\u201d For those unfamiliar, The MLC is a nonprofit organization designated by the U.S. Copyright Office pursuant to the Music Modernization Act of 2018. The royalties come from 20 different providers, which are called DSPs.\nAmong all the DSPs that contributed to The MLC, Apple was the company that paid the highest music licensing fee thanks to Apple Music. Spotify comes right after with $152,226,039 paid, and Amazon comes third with $42,741,507 paid. The list also includes other services such as YouTube, Pandora, and SoundCloud.\nThe transfer of these monies represents the culmination of a months-long effort on the part of The MLC and these DSPs to develop and implement the specifications for these usage reports. With these historical unmatched royalties and usage reports now in hand, The MLC can begin the process of reviewing and analyzing the data in order to find and pay the proper copyright owners.\nAs explained by Variety, The MLC began administering licenses for eligible streaming services in the United States in January 2021. The organization now collects royalties from DSPs and pays songwriters, composers, and other professionals involved in the project.\nOn Jan. 1, the MLC officially began administering a new blanket license covering musical works available on U.S.-based digital audio services. Before the MMA made such a blanket licensing system possible (for US-based DSPs to distribute permanent downloads, limited downloads, and interactive streams), a song-by-song licensing structure was in place. With countless songs on dozens of platforms, it was virtually impossible to license every use of every song, let alone to deliver royalties to rightsholders in a timely fashion\nYou can find more details about music royalty fees on The MLC\u2019s official website.",

        "body": "The popular accessory maker Anker has officially released a new MagSafe-compatible wireless power bank for iPhone 12 users. This comes as rumors suggest Apple is developing its own similar accessory, but that it has faced some roadblocks in development. The Anker accessory was first teased at CES last month and is now available to order.\nThe new Anker PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless Power Bank features a 5,000mAh battery that can charge the iPhone 12 mini from 0 to 100% with a little to spare, the iPhone 12 from 0 to 95%, the iPhone 12 Pro from 0 to 97%, and the iPhone 12 Pro Max from 0 to 75%.\nThe magnetic MagSafe-compatible design is what makes this newest Anker PowerCore battery unique. It can attach to the back of the iPhone 12 and act as a portable wireless charger. Anker explains:\nSnap and Go: Simple and convenient wireless charging; just attach PowerCore magnetically to the back of your phone and watch the charging power flow.\nMade for iPhone 12: Works flawlessly with iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Charges through compatible magnetic cases.\nThe Anker PowerCore Magnetic features LED indicators to show the remaining charge on the battery pack, as well as a USB-C port to charge other accessories and for recharging. It retails for $39.99 and will begin shipping on March 3.\nBloomberg reported last week that Apple is also developing a MagSafe battery accessory for the iPhone 12 series, but that it has faced a few issues in development. The report explained that Apple has been developing this new accessory \u201cfor at least a year,\u201d and it has been \u201cscheduled to launch in the months following the release of the iPhone 12 line.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s important to keep in mind is that MagSafe accessories can charge at 15W, but this Anker accessory is only \u201cMagSafe-compatible,\u201d not MagSafe certified. The Anker PowerCore Magnetic will be limited to standard Qi charging speeds of 5W with the iPhone 12.\nWhether or not Apple\u2019s MagSafe battery pack for iPhone 12 ends up seeing the light of day remains to be seen, but the MagSafe-compatible Anker is available to order from today.\nThanks, Zach!",

        "title": "Bloomberg: Apple Hiring Engineers to Work on 6G Wireless Connectivity",
        "body": "Apple is hiring engineers to work on next-generation 6G wireless technology, based on job listings spotted by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\nThe listings are for positions at Apple's offices in Silicon Valley and San Diego, where the company works on wireless technology development and chip design, according to Gurman's report.\n\"You will have the unique and rewarding opportunity to craft next generation wireless technology that will have deep impact on future Apple products,\" according to the job announcement. \"In this role you will be at the center of a cutting-edge research group responsible for creating next generation disruptive radio access technologies over the next decade.\" People hired for the positions will \"research and design next generation (6G) wireless communication systems for radio access networks\" and \"participate in industry/academic forums passionate about 6G technology.\"\nApple only adopted 5G connectivity in its iPhones last year, and 6G isn't expected to roll out until around 2030, but the job listings indicate Apple is eager to get involved at the earliest stages in the development of the new technology.\nLate last year, Apple joined the Next G Alliance, an industry group set up by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) that seeks to \"advance North American mobile technology leadership in 6G and beyond over the next decade, while building on the long-term evolution of 5G.\"\nThe Next G Alliance held its first meeting for members in November to set the initiative's overarching direction and strategy. The other members of the group include Charter, Cisco, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Keysight Technologies, LG, Mavenir, MITRE, and VMware.\nIn September, AT&T said that it already has engineers working on next-generation 6G networking. Some analysts say the technology could enable speeds more than 100 times faster than 5G, but again, the technology isn't expected to arrive for several years to come.\nThe move continues a trend of Apple preferring to develop in-house hardware for its devices, rather than relying on third-parties. In 2019, Apple and Qualcomm settled a legal battle and reached a multiyear chipset supply agreement that paved the way for Apple to use Qualcomm's 5G modems in iPhone 12 models.\nBeyond that, a court document from the settlement revealed that Apple will likely use the the Snapdragon X60 modem for 2021 iPhones, followed by the world's first 10 Gigabit 5G modem, the Snapdragon X65, in 2022 iPhones.\nThe Snapdragon X65 could be the last Qualcomm modem used in iPhones, however, as Barclays analysts and multiple other sources have forecasted that Apple will switch to its own in-house 5G modem for iPhones by 2023.",
