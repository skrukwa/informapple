CEO Tim Cook is the new chairman of the Advisory Board of the School of Economics and Management (SEM) of Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.\nAccording to Tsinghua University SEM\u2019s public WeChat account, the 20th meeting of the advisory board was held at the Beijing campus on Oct. 18. The meeting was chaired by Cook, with 35 members in attendance.\nCook\u2019s role will be to promote development of the college and make it a world-class economic management school. His mandate will last from 2019 to 2022.\nThe advisory board was established in 2000. It comprises entrepreneurs, business school deans, scholars, leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and financial departments.\nThe day before the advisory board meeting, Cook met with Xiao Ya-qing (\u8096\u4e9e\u6176), director of China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation in Beijing. According to the bureau\u2019s official website, \"The two sides have conducted in-depth exchanges on expanding investment and business development in China, protecting consumer rights and fulfilling corporate social responsibility.\"\nApple actively operates within the Chinese market. Although Cook has met with high-level Chinese executive officials in recent years, many of Apple\u2019s initiatives have been \"looked down on\" by China, according to CNA.\nApple was recently forced by the CCP to remove a crowdsourced map service from its App Store that allowed Hong Kong protesters to track police activity. Cook defended the removal in an email to employees and emphasized the app was removed for illegal use.\nEarlier this month, the Taiwan flag emoji disappeared from Hong Kong and Macau iPhone users\u2019 keyboards after a software update. At the same time, the U.S. online media Quartz, which was reporting on the Hong Kong protests, was removed from the Chinese version of the App Store.\nNews of Cook\u2019s new role comes during trade war talks between the U.S. and China. According to Liberty Times, some netizens have remarked that Cook is \u201cwasting his time trying to stabilize the Chinese market.\u201d",

        "title": "Mac Report: 'AirPods Pro' to Launch End of October with New Design, New Noise-Canceling Feature and $260 Price Tag",
        "body": "Apple's rumored next-generation noise-canceling AirPods will launch at the end of this month with a new \"Pro\" moniker and a price tag of around $260, claims a new Chinese-language report this morning.\nAccording to China Economic Daily, Apple's third-generation AirPods will adopt a new in-ear design to support the new noise-canceling feature and enhance the listening experience. The paper claims the \"Pro\" suffix, which Apple recently adopted for its most expensive iPhone 11 models, will help to differentiate the new wireless earbuds from Apple's existing AirPods and underscores the marketing rationale justifying the higher $260 price tag.\nAccording to a separate report on Friday from the same Chinese-language financial media outlet, the AirPods Pro will also feature a new metal design that increases heat dissipation. Apple AirPods supplier Inventec is said to be cooperating with Chinese manufacturer Lixun to undertake the new orders.\nIn April, noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said two new AirPods models would likely go into mass production between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, with Luxshare, Goertek, and Amkor serving as primary suppliers.\nKuo also claimed one of the new AirPods models will feature an \"all-new form factor design\" and a \"higher price\" than the second-generation AirPods, which cost $159 with a standard charging case and $199 with a wireless charging case. The other model is expected to be a more iterative update with the same pricing, although it's unclear what any new features would be.\nPreviously, the AirPods expected to launch later this year were thought to be the more iterative pair that Kuo refers to. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said he expects the higher-priced AirPods with water resistance and noise cancelation to launch as early as 2020. However, today's report suggests they could come sooner.\nAccording to industry sources previously cited by DigiTimes, Apple's suppliers are gearing up to assemble the next-generation AirPods as early as October, suggesting an updated version of the earphones could arrive in time for the holiday shopping season.\nIn the beta version of iOS 13.2 there's an icon showing redesigned AirPods that appear to have rubber ear tips that would likely be needed as part of a noise cancelation feature. The image is contained in the Accessibility Settings folder, suggesting the new AirPods will contain a new accessibility feature such as being able to use them as hearing aids, or it could be related to existing Live Listen capabilities.\nNo specific date has been given for when the new AirPods could debut, but Apple has a number of rumored pending announcements that could point toward an October media event.",

        "title": "Update: Apple reinstates Hong Kong protest app that it called \u2018illegal\u2019",
        "body": "There is controversy today after Apple removed a Hong Kong protest app from the App Store. The developers claim that the app helps people avoid trouble spots and comply with the law, while Apple says that it\u2019s intended to circumvent the law.\nIt\u2019s currently unclear whether Apple made its own decision to remove the HKmap Live app, or whether it acted at the request of the Chinese government\u2026\nUpdate 10/4: Apple has reversed its decision and brought back the Hong Kong protest app, HKmap Live. The developers shared the following in a tweet, \u201cThanks everyone, @Apple finally made the right decision. Will update later as things are going crazy in #HK now.\u201d\nThe developers tweeted an apparent quote from Apple, explaining why the app was pulled.\n\u201cYour app contains content \u2014 or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity \u2014 that is not legal\u2026 Specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement.\u201d @Apple assume our user are lawbreakers and therefore evading law enforcement, which is clearly not the case.\nA follow-up tweet suggested it was perhaps an error on the part of Apple.\nTo make it clear, I still believe this is more a bureaucratic f up than censorship.\nHKmap Live let people track police activity on the streets of Hong Kong, and could clearly be used in two very different ways.\nIt could be used by protesters who want to evade the police, or it could be used to allow citizens to avoid trouble spots where there is a danger of being caught up in conflicts between the police and protesters.\nThat latter argument has been bolstered by a violent clash earlier this week, where protesters threw objects at police officers, and one of those officers shot a protester in the chest with live rounds, as the Independent reported.\nA protester has been shot in the chest as police fired live rounds during clashes in Hong Kong, according to activists and local media. The Demosisto protest group shared a video on social media that appeared to show a police officer firing a handgun into the chest of an approaching protester at near-point-blank range. The video, captured and posted online by a Hong Kong University student union group, showed the police officer was surrounded by protesters throwing objects when he opened fire. A police official confirmed an officer had opened fire in the Tsuen Wan area, and that a protester had been hit. The man\u2019s friend told reporters he was in a critical condition at Princess Margaret hospital in Kwai Chung. It is the first time a protester has been struck by police live fire since the political unrest began in June, though officers have fired warning shots into the air on several occasions in the past.\nThe Register notes that developers could also argue that the Hong Kong protest app is entirely in line with official police policy.\nHong Kong citizens have highlighted a quirk of local laws that provide a strong counterargument: Under the law, the Hong Kong police are obliged to wave a blue flag at the spot in which they wish to declare that an illegal gathering is taking place. The intent is to give citizens sufficient notice and time to move away from the area before any police action is taken. The HKmap Live app simply takes that official approach and extends it to citizens, allowing them to notify others of action that will be taken in specific locations.\nWhile Apple may have complied with a request from the Chinese authorities, it seems odd that the same information is still available on the web.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "Kuo: Apple to release 'iPhone SE 2' in Q1 2020 with iPhone 8 design, A13 processor",
        "body": "Apple is set to launch the next version of the iPhone SE 2 in the first quarter of 2020, according to renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The new phone will be more affordable than the rest of the Apple iPhone lineup and feature newer internals, like an A13 processor with 3 GB RAM, in a familiar iPhone 8 chassis.\nKuo says that most of the new iPhone SE\u2019s hardware specification will mirror the iPhone 8. The analyst predicts Apple will sell 30-40 million units across 2020.\nThe Q1 timeframe lines up with a previous report from Nikkei, which said to expect a cheaper iPhone with iPhone 8-esque design in the spring. This would mean it would feature a 4.7-inch LCD display and Touch ID home button.\nKuo does not predict an exact price for the new phone. Before the 4-inch iPhone SE was discontinued, Apple sold it for $349 in a 32 GB storage configuration.\nThe current iPhone product range at Apple stores spans the iPhone 11 series, iPhone XR and the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The 4.7-inch iPhone 8 is currently on sale for $449 for 64 GB.\nPresumably, when the new SE launches, Apple will stop selling the iPhone 8 altogether. Given the current pricing of the 8, you could easily see how Apple could sell an iPhone SE 2 32 GB for around the same price as the old SE, in the $349-$399 range.\nKuo notes that the key target market for the new iPhone SE would be iPhone 6 owners. A spec-bumped iPhone 8 appeals to people who are not fussed about the latest iPhone features like Face ID or multi-camera modules, but do want a fast and speedy iPhone experience able to take advantage of the latest iOS features.\nNotably, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are not eligible to upgrade to iOS 13. Kuo notes that there may be \u201curgent replacement demand\u201d for users who want to upgrade to get the latest iOS 13 features. One such example is Apple Arcade. If Apple can get iPhone 6 owners to upgrade to an A13 entry-level phone, it could also lead to increased Apple Arcade subscriptions. The A13 chip would also enable augmented-reality experiences that the older phones are not powerful enough to run.\nAn iPhone 8-sized SE will not necessarily appeal to iPhone SE users who crave the small compact 4-inch form factor. However, the iPhone 8 is still significantly smaller than any of Apple\u2019s flagships introduced since then. At the very least, it\u2019s an option for people who like small phones but still want to be able to take advantage of Apple\u2019s latest processor improvements.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

In contrast, the Starbucks app has commanded a 40 percent market share of mobile payments for the last few years, but growth potential is limited because it can only be used in Starbucks stores.\nTotal spending via contactless mobile payments will approach $100 billion this year in the U.S., according to eMarketer. On average, that is equivalent to a user spending $1,545 per year, up more than 24 percent over last year.\nNearly 64 million people (30 percent of all U.S. smartphone users) are expected to make use of mobile payments this year, a 9.1 percent increase over 2018. In terms of demographics, nearly 50 percent of all smartphone users are adults aged 25 to 34, so the growth of mobile payments is expected to be strongest in this age group, although digital wallet use is said to be growing across the board.\n\"Although a growing number of millennials feel secure using payment apps, virtually all still find credit and debit cards equally convenient,\" said eMarketer forecasting analyst Vincent Yip.

He started at Apple in 2008 and was a senior director of corporate law from 2013 until 2018, according to the indictment. The trades mentioned in the indictment occurred between 2011 and 2016.\nOne of his responsibilities at Apple was making sure that Apple employees didn't do any insider trading. \"Levoff's responsibilities included ensuring compliance with Company-1's Insider Trading Policy,\" according to the indictment.\nThe indictment alleges that Levoff traded stock during a \"blackout\" period, when employees can't buy or sell stock, and that he informed Apple employees about the blackout period during the same time frame he was trading Apple stock.\nThe SEC previously charged Levoff in February in a civil case. Thursday's indictment is criminal, and each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison in addition to fines.\nApple declined to comment.\n\"After being contacted by authorities last summer we conducted a thorough investigation with the help of outside legal experts, which resulted in termination,\" Apple said about the case in February.\n\"We look forward to vigorously defending Mr. Levoff with respect to these allegations,\" Kevin Marino, Levoff's lawyer, told CNBC.\nCNBC's Jim Forkin contributed to this story.",

        "body": "Apple has reportedly set an aggressive 2022 deadline to develop in-house 5G modems as part of a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design to be used in future iPhones and iPads, claims a new report today.\nAccording to Fast Company, Apple plans to have completed all the development, testing, and certification necessary by the new deadline to be able to include the modems in new iPhones the same year.\nHowever, given the arduous testing and certification process required after the chip design and fabrication is complete, a two-years deadline for the modem is \"really pushing it,\" according to the report's source, who is said to have knowledge of Apple's plans.\nThe main stumbling block is said to be the network optimization testing that's necessary to make sure the modem doesn't conflict with the wireless networks of other carriers. In addition, tests are needed to ensure compliance with global standards, not to mention the ability of the modem to satisfy FCC requirements.\nGiven those hurdles, Fast Company's source believes 2023 may be a more realistic completion date for Apple's SoC modem.\nApple agreed to acquire the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business in June, with a view to accelerating the development of its own 5G modem. A previous source claimed the iPhone maker wants to have an in-house chip ready for use in some of its products by 2021, while earlier sources reported timeframes of between 2022 and 2025.\nWhatever the timeline is and regardless of whether Apple is able to stick to it, the company's transition to custom 5G modems will likely happen in phases, starting with lower-end and older models of devices. Apple has a multiyear chipset supply agreement with Qualcomm, and a six-year patent license agreement, so it doesn't exactly have to rush the process.\nIn the meantime, Apple is expected to use Qualcomm's chips for the first 5G-enabled iPhones in 2020.",

The factory is said to be producing iPhone XR handsets, with iPhone 11 also to be added to the mix in the same facility, located near Chennai.\nThe company has just started commercial production of the iPhone XR locally at the Foxconn facility near Chennai after undertaking trials for several weeks, reflecting a move up the manufacturing value chain in India. Following this, Apple plans to start making the latest iPhone 11 series. Making the iPhone XR involves a higher level of technical skill, the executives said. Apple will export the devices to other markets after having tested the waters with the export of iPhone 6s and 7 models to Europe in the past few months.\nApple will not only remove some of its reliance on Chinese iPhone manufacturing with this move, but alsos ave money on import duty. Although those savings will not be passed on to the customer, the source notes.\nWhile Apple will be able to save around 20% in import duty through local manufacturing of the iPhone XR, the executives said this won't lead to any price drops. Apple hasn't cut prices on any of its locally made iPhones.\nApple is acutely aware that the United States and China remain in a trade war and tariffs continue to escalate, although there is cause for optimism.

        "body": "After the Pixel 4's announcement, we were surprised to discover it didn't offer free original quality backups on Google Photos like its predecessors. The next day, a Redditor made things even worse for Pixel users by explaining that the new iPhones do get unlimited original quality backups on Photos because they use the HEIC format. We've reached out to Google and got confirmation that this is indeed the case, but it's a \"bug\" that'll be fixed.\nRedditor u/stephenvsawyer explained that iPhones currently save photos in the new compressed and efficient HEIC format, which is smaller than Google's compressed JPEG. When uploaded to Google Photos, these pics don't need to be compressed from Original Quality to High Quality JPEG, because they're already smaller than the latter. So iPhone users are essentially getting their snaps stored on Google Photos for free, in their original size.\nANDROIDPOLICE VIDEO OF THE DAY\nWe tried to verify this claim on our end, but we hit a few roadblocks. We don't have many new iPhones at hand to test this with, and checking which media files count against storage in Google Photos and which ones don't is impossible (trust us, we've tried anything and everything).\nWe reached out to Google for comment and got a confirmation that indeed, pics captured as HEIC/HEIF aren't compressed and aren't charged against Photos' quota. A Google spokesperson told us: \"We are aware of this bug and are working to fix it.\"\nHowever, what that means remains unclear. Would Google start charging for HEIC images stored in Photos, even if they're small and don't take up much space? Would it forcibly re-convert those pics to compressed JPEG, or compress them further under the HEIC format? And will the fix apply to all HEIC images or just iPhones? (Samsung devices also support saving photos as HEIC, but that doesn't seem widely adopted by users.)

        "body": "\"AirPods Pro\" will come in as many as eight colors, including White, Black, and a new Midnight Green finish to match iPhone 11 Pro models, according to a Chinese-language report from the Economic Daily News.\nAirPods Pro concept via EverythingApplePro\nGoogle's machine translation of the report is not easy to decipher, so the source of the information is unclear. Eight colors would certainly be a lot, although it is not out of the question given that Apple has made Beats headphones like the Solo3 available in over a dozen colors over the years.\nThe report also backs rumors that the AirPods Pro will feature active noise cancellation and water resistance. Last month, in the iOS 13.2 beta filesystem, MacRumors discovered an icon depicting never-before-seen, in-ear AirPods with rubber ear tips that would presumably help to block out ambient noise.\nApple plans to release the AirPods Pro in time for the holiday shopping season this year, according to the Economic Daily News, with the report claiming the earphones could be unveiled as early as next week.\nThis is not the first time the Economic Daily News has reported that Apple plans to release new AirPods in a black color, as the publication made the same claim back in February. A month later, Apple released second-generation AirPods with Hey Siri support, up to 50 percent more talk time, and an optional wireless charging case, but the black color was nowhere to be seen.\nHowever, it is worth noting that Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said Apple originally planned to release the second-generation AirPods in 2018, but they were delayed, so it is possible the black color was always intended to be for these third-generation AirPods with noise cancellation and water resistance.\nIndian blog MySmartPrice also said black AirPods were in the works back in February, claiming they would feature a matte finish with improved grip. Combined with last week's Economic Daily News report claiming that the AirPods Pro will sport a new metal design, perhaps the earphones and their charging case will look similar to the back glass of iPhone 11 Pro models, complete with matching colors.\nLeaked photos, knockoffs, and accessories all point towards the AirPods Pro charging case being wider to accommodate the ear tips.\nAs higher-end earphones, the AirPods Pro will likely have improved sound. Last week's Economic Daily News report also claimed that the AirPods Pro will feature multiple listening modes, suggesting they could have the same Transparency feature as the new Beats Solo Pro, which turns on the external microphones so the wearer can hear outside noise without pausing music playback.\nUnsurprisingly, higher-end AirPods would likely have a higher price tag than the current AirPods. Economic Daily News estimates pricing may start at around $259, which would be $100 more than the current AirPods with a wired charging case. However, supply chain reports are usually guessing about pricing.\nApple typically unveils redesigned products during its keynotes, but an October event is looking unlikely this year, so possibilities include Apple announcing the AirPods Pro with a press release, hosting an unprecedented November event, or waiting to unveil them at its typical March event next year.",

        "title": "Without encryption, we will lose all privacy. This is our new battleground",
        "body": "In every country of the world, the security of computers keeps the lights on, the shelves stocked, the dams closed, and transportation running. For more than half a decade, the vulnerability of our computers and computer networks has been ranked the number one risk in the US Intelligence Community\u2019s Worldwide Threat Assessment \u2013 that\u2019s higher than terrorism, higher than war. Your bank balance, the local hospital\u2019s equipment, and the 2020 US presidential election, among many, many other things, all depend on computer safety.\nAnd yet, in the midst of the greatest computer security crisis in history, the US government, along with the governments of the UK and Australia, is attempting to undermine the only method that currently exists for reliably protecting the world\u2019s information: encryption. Should they succeed in their quest to undermine encryption, our public infrastructure and private lives will be rendered permanently unsafe.\nIn the simplest terms, encryption is a method of protecting information, the primary way to keep digital communications safe. Every email you write, every keyword you type into a search box \u2013 every embarrassing thing you do online \u2013 is transmitted across an increasingly hostile internet. Earlier this month the US, alongside the UK and Australia, called on Facebook to create a \u201cbackdoor\u201d, or fatal flaw, into its encrypted messaging apps, which would allow anyone with the key to that backdoor unlimited access to private communications. So far, Facebook has resisted this.\nIf internet traffic is unencrypted, any government, company, or criminal that happens to notice it can \u2013 and, in fact, does \u2013 steal a copy of it, secretly recording your information for ever. If, however, you encrypt this traffic, your information cannot be read: only those who have a special decryption key can unlock it.\nI know a little about this, because for a time I operated part of the US National Security Agency\u2019s global system of mass surveillance. In June 2013 I worked with journalists to reveal that system to a scandalised world. Without encryption I could not have written the story of how it all happened \u2013 my book Permanent Record \u2013 and got the manuscript safely across borders that I myself can\u2019t cross. More importantly, encryption helps everyone from reporters, dissidents, activists, NGO workers and whistleblowers, to doctors, lawyers and politicians, to do their work \u2013 not just in the world\u2019s most dangerous and repressive countries, but in every single country.\nWhen I came forward in 2013, the US government wasn\u2019t just passively surveilling internet traffic as it crossed the network, but had also found ways to co-opt and, at times, infiltrate the internal networks of major American tech companies. At the time, only a small fraction of web traffic was encrypted: six years later, Facebook, Google and Apple have made encryption-by-default a central part of their products, with the result that today close to 80% of web traffic is encrypted. Even the former director of US national intelligence, James Clapper, credits the revelation of mass surveillance with significantly advancing the commercial adoption of encryption. The internet is more secure as a result. Too secure, in the opinion of some governments.\nDonald Trump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, who authorised one of the earliest mass surveillance programmes without reviewing whether it was legal, is now signalling an intention to halt \u2013 or even roll back \u2013 the progress of the last six years. WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, already uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE): in March the company announced its intention to incorporate E2EE into its other messaging apps \u2013 Facebook Messenger and Instagram \u2013 as well. Now Barr is launching a public campaign to prevent Facebook from climbing this next rung on the ladder of digital security. This began with an open letter co-signed by Barr, UK home secretary Priti Patel, Australia\u2019s minister for home affairs and the US secretary of homeland security, demanding Facebook abandon its encryption proposals.\nIf Barr\u2019s campaign is successful, the communications of billions will remain frozen in a state of permanent insecurity: users will be vulnerable by design. And those communications will be vulnerable not only to investigators in the US, UK and Australia, but also to the intelligence agencies of China, Russia and Saudi Arabia \u2013 not to mention hackers around the world.\nEnd-to-end encrypted communication systems are designed so that messages can be read only by the sender and their intended recipients, even if the encrypted \u2013 meaning locked \u2013 messages themselves are stored by an untrusted third party, for example, a social media company such as Facebook.\nThe central improvement E2EE provides over older security systems is in ensuring the keys that unlock any given message are only ever stored on the specific devices at the end-points of a communication \u2013 for example the phones of the sender or receiver of the message \u2013 rather than the middlemen who own the various internet platforms enabling it. Since E2EE keys aren\u2019t held by these intermediary service providers, they can no longer be stolen in the event of the massive corporate data breaches that are so common today, providing an essential security benefit. In short, E2EE enables companies such as Facebook, Google or Apple to protect their users from their scrutiny: by ensuring they no longer hold the keys to our most private conversations, these corporations become less of an all-seeing eye than a blindfolded courier.\nIt is striking that when a company as potentially dangerous as Facebook appears to be at least publicly willing to implement technology that makes users safer by limiting its own power, it is the US government that cries foul. This is because the government would suddenly become less able to treat Facebook as a convenient trove of private lives.\nTo justify its opposition to encryption, the US government has, as is traditional, invoked the spectre of the web\u2019s darkest forces. Without total access to the complete history of every person\u2019s activity on Facebook, the government claims it would be unable to investigate terrorists, drug dealers money launderers and the perpetrators of child abuse \u2013 bad actors who, in reality, prefer not to plan their crimes on public platforms, especially not on US-based ones that employ some of the most sophisticated automatic filters and reporting methods available.\nThe true explanation for why the US, UK and Australian governments want to do away with end-to-end encryption is less about public safety than it is about power: E2EE gives control to individuals and the devices they use to send, receive and encrypt communications, not to the companies and carriers that route them. This, then, would require government surveillance to become more targeted and methodical, rather than indiscriminate and universal.\nWhat this shift jeopardises is strictly nations\u2019 ability to spy on populations at mass scale, at least in a manner that requires little more than paperwork. By limiting the amount of personal records and intensely private communications held by companies, governments are returning to classic methods of investigation that are both effective and rights-respecting, in lieu of total surveillance. In this outcome we remain not only safe, but free.",
