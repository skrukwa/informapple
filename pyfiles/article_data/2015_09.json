        "title": "Tim Cook says Apple may consider allowing users to remove some preinstalled apps.",
        "body": "Following last week's announcement of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, Tim Cook has been paying unannounced visits to a few Apple Stores to talk with the store's employees and take pictures with customers. During a ride to the company's flagship 5th Avenue location in Manhattan, BuzzFeed got a few minutes with the Apple CEO, where he discussed everything from the privacy concerns of the new \"Hey Siri\" feature to whether or not iPhone users will ever be able to delete those Apple-created stock apps from their smartphones.\nDirectly addressing the privacy and safety concerns of \"Hey Siri\", Cook mentioned that anyone who is fearful of such things can always turn the feature off. Still, he described \"the real answer\" to be the fact that any information collected by the feature remains on the iPhone, and isn't sent to Apple or anyone else. On the lighter side, when asked about the newest features coming to the next generation iPhones, Cook's favorite appears to be 3D Touch.\nCook is hot on all of this stuff; he describes Live Photos with near Jobsian hyperbole \u2014 \u201cI think Live Photos is a medium that hasn\u2019t existed before. It\u2019s like discovering a new form.\u201d But he\u2019s most excited by 3D Touch. \u201cI personally think 3D Touch is a game changer,\u201d he says. \u201cI find that my efficiency is way up with 3D touch, because I can go through so many emails so quickly. It really does cut out a number of navigational steps to get where you\u2019re going.\u201d\nWhen asked whether the company ever holds back a massive innovation ready for an \"S\" year, for the next generation (next year's assumed \"iPhone 7\"), Cook was adamant in stating \u201cAs soon as products are ready we\u2019re going to release them. There\u2019s no holding back.\" Another such innovation, the new iPhone Upgrade Program, is promised by the CEO to be aimed at improving customer experience with an \"easier\" and \"simpler\" way for those who want the new iPhone each year.\nThanks in part to the announcement of products like the iPad Pro, Cook also mentions that because \"we\u2019re at the point where the iPad does what some people want to do with their PCs,\" he posits that some people may \"never\" buy a proper desktop or laptop computer. Still, he believes the Mac is a \"key part\" of the company's strategy and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future.\nOne aspect that may be changing in the future, however, is a much-requested way to delete apps like \"Stocks\" and \"Tips\" from the iPhone. Cook and the company are aware of the fans' cry for the feature and want to work something out, but it may be more complicated than it seems.\n\u201cThis is a more complex issue than it first appears,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are some apps that are linked to something else on the iPhone. If they were to be removed they might cause issues elsewhere on the phone. There are other apps that aren\u2019t like that. So over time, I think with the ones that aren\u2019t like that, we\u2019ll figure out a way [for you to remove them]. \u2026 It\u2019s not that we want to suck up your real estate, we\u2019re not motivated to do that. We want you to be happy. So I recognize that some people want to do this, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re looking at.\u201d\nApple announced the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPad Pro last week along with other products like the new Apple TV, and some new information on upcoming updates like iOS 9 and watchOS 2. The new iPhones went up for pre-order over the weekend and are scheduled to launch next week on Friday, September 25. Cook's interview with BuzzFeed in New York today precedes his upcoming appearance on the new Late Show with Stephen Colbert, airing tonight at 11:30 p.m. on CBS.\nThe full interview between Cook and BuzzFeed is worth a read.",

        "title": "Apple poaching Tesla employees with 60% salary increases and $250,000 signing bonuses.",
        "body": "Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\nLook out, Tesla. Apple is speeding into your rearview. The Cupertino, Calif., colossus is gearing up to release an electric car by 2019 and it's hiring 1,200 more employees to get the show on the road, reports the The Wall Street Journal.\nFinally, after a year of weighing the possibility of its own branded wheels, Apple appears to have the green light to forge ahead. An earlier report had a new iCar (we're guessing at its name here) slated to arrive in 2020, but it's reportedly scheduled to debut even earlier. News hit yesterday that the company has just stamped the initiative a \"committed project,\" sources close to the matter told the Journal.\nApple's ambitious shift from the consumer electronics market into the automotive fast lane comes on the heels of a meeting with officials at California's Department of Motor Vehicles. On Aug. 17, an Apple senior legal executive talked with a Golden State autonomous vehicle expert, along with the DMV's chief of strategic planning, according to documents acquired by The Guardian. The hour-long meeting fueled rumors that Apple is indeed serious about driving into the car market, just as Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and countless others in and outside of Silicon Valley have long predicted.\nRelated: With Apple's 'CarPlay,' the Race for Flashier In-Car Touchscreen Controls Revs Up\nAs for Musk, he recently told Bloomberg Businessweek that Apple was tempting his Tesla employees to jump ship by offering 60 percent salary increases and $250,000 signing bonuses. \"Apple tries very hard to recruit from Tesla,\" he said. \"But so far they've actually recruited very few people.\" Whether poached from Tesla or not, Apple is reportedly tripling its existing 600-person team for the vehicle product program, which is said to be codenamed \"Project Titan.\"\nThose hoping Apple's first whip would be a self-driving machine will probably be disappointed. Sources familiar with the project say Apple is not looking to make its inaugural vehicle entirely autonomous, despite reportedly onboarding an unknown number of driverless car specialists. However, if individuals close to venture prove right, a self-driving option will likely be available over the long-term.\nRelated: Elon Musk Admits to 'Conversations' With Apple About Tesla\nMeanwhile, Tesla, the undisputed electric car market frontrunner for the moment, is still working out the kinks on an autopilot semi-driverless software update for the Model S. Musk has publicly teased the feature for months. The upgrade will merely assist drivers, not entirely replace them. Google, for its part, is potentially driving in a different direction, per an executive at the search giant, who recently said her employer is considering selling its driverless tech directly to existing automakers.\nAs for how much an Apple car might cost, that remains one of the many unknowns surrounding Apple's pivot into the luxury electric car race. We imagine the term \"sticker shock\" won't even begin to cover it.\nRelated: Apple Says It's Cleaning Up the App Store After Its First Large-Scale Malware Attack",

        "title": "Apple, in refusing backdoor access to data, may face fines",
        "body": "Tim Cook testifying to Congress last year. (Image: file photo via CBSNews.com)\nThis week, The New York Times reported that the Justice Dept. served Apple with a court order in a case \"involving guns and drugs,\" demanding it provide real-time access to iMessage, Apple's proprietary service for sending messages between iPhones.\nApple refused -- not because it necessarily wanted to, but because it couldn't comply. The iPhone and iPad maker reportedly told the feds that the service is encrypted, making it impossible for the company let alone the feds to access the data they demanded, unlike phone companies which, under US wiretap laws, are required to comply.\nThe criminal case is under seal in an unidentified U.S. federal court.\nApple's defiance comes at a time when the FBI is pushing for access to user data in the wake of the claims that the U.S. government had access to Silicon Valley systems through its PRISM surveillance program. In response to allegations it was complicit in spying on Americans, Apple quelled fears by revealing its iMessage texting and FaceTime calling services were encrypted and unable to be wiretapped, and said even it \"cannot decrypt that data.\" Around the same time, the company proceeded to offer device encryption, forcing feds to go directly to the suspect in question to get access to some user data.\nThose two events, with other companies threatening to follow suit, have caused considerable stress for the Obama administration.\nSpeaking to The Times, officials from the Justice Dept. and the FBI \"advocate taking Apple to court,\" though their motives are unclear. One possibility is that the government will demand that Apple creates some kind of backdoor, a move which chief executive Tim Cook said he would \"never allow\" to happen. Cook went on to say -- presumably referring to the government -- that \"they have to cart us out in a box before we would do that.\"\nIt's a strong enough sentiment, but every person -- and company -- has a breaking point.\nDespite Apple's assurance that it it won't -- and can't -- create a backdoor for government access, security experts and researchers have claimed the contrary -- specifically that Apple's system has a weakness that could allow the government a way in.\nSecurity researcher Nicholas Weaver last month outlined on legal blog Lawfare how Apple's \"sin-of-omission\" allows the feds to wiretap iMessage conversations. The messaging system contains a flaw in how iPhone users verify each other, said Weaver. He refers to a \"lurking security landmine\" in how Apple allows users to backup messages to its cloud, which not only can be subpoenaed but is also turned on for users by default.\n\"The obvious flaw in this system is that the government could potentially force Apple to add an additional public key to your account, which would be analogous to registering an extra device,\" said cryptography expert Matthew Green in an email. \"Now everyone who sends you a message will be unknowingly encrypting an additional copy of the message to this new 'ghost device.' If the government runs that device, they can tap your messages.\"\nSimply put: Apple could be forced to allow the FBI to impersonate an iPhone user, which would in effect allow the agency to siphon off a suspect's messages as they come in.\nGreen added that services like WhatsApp and Signal are \"also vulnerable to similar attacks.\"\n\"The real question is: could the government force Apple to do this against its will?\" said Green. \"Could a court force them to modify their technology in order to make eavesdropping possible?\"\nThat's a question which has been, to a degree, answered before.\nEven if Apple says there is no way for it to create a backdoor, there's always one other option the government has up its sleeve: the threat of heavy financial sanctions.\nBy sheer coincidence, it was exactly a year ago on September 11, 2014 that Yahoo was able -- for the first time -- to shed light on its secret FISA Court battle with the US government almost a decade earlier. The Bush administration was pushing the Web giant into \"joining\" the PRISM program, a move that Yahoo \"refused to comply with what we viewed as unconstitutional and overbroad surveillance.\"\nThe administration pushed for contempt, at which point Yahoo buckled. The company was faced with daily fines of $250,000 per day, which would double each month. By month five, Yahoo would have faced fines upwards of the entire U.S. national debt, and then some.\nCould that happen to Apple, or any other company?\n\"The courts can effectuate their own orders and hold companies in contempt or impose sanctions,\" said EFF staff attorney Andrew Crocker. \"If you look at the litigation from 2007 that Yahoo was fighting in the [FISA Court]... that was an example of a fairly extreme attempt of a court trying to enforce its own order.\"\nA company like Apple with that much money -- said to be more than $200 billion in cash -- wouldn't go down without a fight, and could potentially have a considerably negative effect on U.S. stock markets.\nThe Justice Dept.'s ongoing, sealed case against against Apple could escalate from the federal court it's at now -- if it hasn't already -- to the same secretive Washington DC-based surveillance court to which Yahoo was summoned. Security expert Bruce Schneier said in a recent blog post that there is \"a persistent rumor going around that Apple is in the secret FISA Court, fighting a government order to make its platform more surveillance-friendly -- and they're losing.\"\nApple declined to comment on the record.\nBecause of the secretive nature of the FISA Court, we may never know if Apple has been, or will be in the future, forced to comply with a seemingly immoral or technologically impossible task.\nApple may have power and might, and more of the public on its side than any party in politics ever will, but the government has the power to bring that all crashing down by levying unreasonable and far-reaching financial sanctions.",

        "title": "IFixit finds evidence that Apple quietly made the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus more liquid-resistant.",
        "body": "On Friday, we tore down Apple\u2019s two newest iPhones and found something new lurking (quite literally) just below the surface. When we opened up the 6s, we discovered some mystery adhesive around a display that\u2019s already secured with screws. Weird. It\u2019s not as if past iPhone displays were in danger of falling out of the phone. In fact, they can be pretty tough to remove (which is why grunt-saving tools like the iSclack have a favored place in our tool bag).\nSo if the iPhone display didn\u2019t need adhesive, what was Apple up to?\nWe had our suspicions, based in part on Apple patent filings in one particular area: waterproofing. Apple has been investigating a waterproof (or, more accurately, liquid proof) iPhone for at least the last several years. If that strip of sticky goop on the 6s wasn\u2019t put there to hold the display in, then maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014it was designed to keep liquids out. Like a gasket!\nOf course, that was only a theory. But over the weekend some brave Apple fans introduced their new iPhones to a life aquatic. The phones didn\u2019t always emerge unscathed, but the overall trend is clear: the 6s and 6s Plus are dramatically less prone to liquid damage than their predecessors. (They aren\u2019t, of course, completely waterproof\u2014so don\u2019t jump into a pool with them or anything.)\nSo, what changed? After disassembling a couple of new iPhones in the name of science, here\u2019s what we found.\nFirst, Apple takes this gasket business pretty seriously: they didn\u2019t just run a strip of glue around the existing display like they were caulking a bathtub. Instead, it appears the iPhone\u2019s frame has been subtly reworked to accommodate the new gasket. We noted a slight, but measurable, increase in the width of the lip running along the perimeter of the frame\u2014it\u2019s about 0.3 mm wider than on the iPhone 6, making it just wide enough for that little gasket to land on. One-third of a millimeter may not seem like much, but given how tight the iPhone\u2019s tolerances are nowadays, the change is big enough to see with the naked eye. And it\u2019s almost certainly enough of a change that other components had to be subtly tweaked to match. Make no mistake, Apple gave this careful thought.\nThe logic board brought a bigger surprise. Every cable connector on the board\u2014from the battery and display, to the Lightning port and buttons\u2014is surrounded by what appears to be a tiny silicone seal. Those little connectors are the most vulnerable bits of the device\u2014quick to short out and corrode during unplanned aquatic excursions. Apple filed a patent for waterproof silicone seals on board-to-board connectors just this past March. It appears this is one patent they\u2019ve rapidly put into production. (The jury is still out on the second piece of that patent, a hydrophobic conformal coating for printed circuit boards. We\u2019ll update this post if our tests can confirm whether it\u2019s there.)\nOther parts of the iPhone 6s did not change dramatically in terms of waterproofiness. As we noted in our initial teardown, the power and volume buttons underwent a minor redesign, but they haven\u2019t yet adopted the more radical waterproof profile seen in Apple patent filings. Perhaps Apple will save that particular innovation for the iPhone 7 (rumors have pegged the iPhone 7 as fully \u201cwaterproof,\u201d as opposed to just water resistant.)\nNo obvious signs of waterproofing in the speaker or headphone jack, either. The speaker sports a slightly finer mesh weave than that of the iPhone 6, but it doesn\u2019t appear to repel water any better\u2014in our tests, both speakers seemed to gulp down liquids at about the same rate. The SIM tray has been slightly altered as well, but it doesn\u2019t look to be any more waterproof.\nSo, there are still places for water to get into the case. Maybe that strip of goo around the display isn\u2019t for waterproofing after all, but has some other nefarious purpose; 3D Touch is a new technology, so it\u2019s hard to say. Nevertheless, we think this is an exciting step forward for the iPhone and its fans. You can repair your iPhone 6s just as easily as its predecessor\u2014and while it\u2019s not necessarily \u201cwaterproof,\u201d the added water resistance means you\u2019re less likely to have to repair it in the first place.\nWe call that a win. Here\u2019s a video summary of our investigation:\nWe\u2019ve updated the existing teardown with our newest findings, too. So wander on over to the teardown for more pictures and analysis on the entire device.",

        "title": "Daring Fireball: The iPhones 6S",
        "body": "The iPhones 6S\nThe pattern is pretty clear. In even-numbered years (2008, 2010, 2012, 2014) Apple releases all-new iPhone form factors: 3G, 4, 5, 6/6 Plus. In the subsequent years, they release \u201cS\u201d variants: iPhones that look nearly identical to their predecessors, but with improved components.\nWhy do they do this?\nThere are some ecosystem advantages to this tick-tock1 schedule. Most iPhone cases, for example, fit both the tick and tock iPhones. (The rare exceptions are certain hard cases with extremely tight tolerances. The iPhones 6S, for example, are both a few tenths of a millimeter bigger, wider, and thicker than their corresponding siblings from last year.) I think there are some branding advantages to this two-year cycle as well. iPhones are iconic devices. The devices themselves are recognizable. Keeping each new form factor around for two model years lets that iconic appearance seep deeper into the mass market collective consciousness.\nReleasing a new generation of iPhones every year \u2014 year in, year out \u2014 is an aggressive pace given the scale and scope of the iPhone, and its importance to Apple financially. Sure, other handset makers put out dozens of different models every year. But Apple is playing an entirely different game. With one exception \u2014 the iPhone 5C two years ago (a phone which, as time goes by, seems more and more curious strategically) \u2014 Apple has never made a new iPhone other than a new top-of-the-line industry-leading flagship. In the same way that automobiles don\u2019t change form factors every year, I don\u2019t think it would be feasible for Apple to change the iPhone\u2019s form factor every year. I think it takes more than a year for Apple\u2019s design team to create a new iPhone design \u2014 at least to create a new design that is different because it is better, not merely different for the sake of being different.\nThe glaring downside to this tick-tock schedule is that we as a culture \u2014 and particularly the media, both on the tech/gadgetry side and the business side \u2014 are obsessed with \u201cnew\u201d. And, well, the S-model iPhones don\u2019t look new. This year there is a new rose gold aluminum finish, but at a glance, the iPhones 6S look like last year\u2019s iPhones 6. Every year is an iterative improvement over the previous one, whether it\u2019s an S year or not. But it\u2019s hard not to see the S years as more iterative, less impressive, updates, simply because they look the same.\nI think that\u2019s a trap \u2014 a way to be fooled by your eyes. If you put aside what the phones look like, the S model years have brought some of the biggest changes to the platform. The display changes came in non-S years, of course \u2014 the iPhone 4 going retina; the iPhone 5 expanding from 3.5 to 4 inches diagonally and changing the aspect ratio; and of course last year\u2019s 6/6 Plus expanding to 4.7 and 5.5 inches and higher display resolutions. But it was the 3GS that first improved on CPU performance and gave us the first improvements to the camera. The 4S ushered in Siri integration and a much faster camera. The 5S was Apple\u2019s first 64-bit ARM device, years ahead of the competition, and was the first device with Touch ID. For a typical iPhone user on a two-year upgrade cycle, I think the S years are the better phones, historically.\nHere\u2019s a passage from my 5S/5C review two years ago:\nRefinement, in the eyes of these naysayers, does not count as innovation. Only revolution counts. But the iPhone needs no revolution. It continues to sell better year-over-year, year after year, without lowering its prices. Every step of the way between 2007 and that lone original iPhone \u2014 running an OS with no third-party apps, no multitasking, not even copy-and-paste \u2014 and today\u2019s world, where Apple is on the cusp of selling its 700 millionth iOS device and the lineup ranges from the iPod Touch to the iPhones to two sizes of iPad, has been about just that: refinement. The iPhone 5S shows that there remains much room for refinement.\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been more of a trap to approach an S-model iPhone as \u201cjust a slightly improved version of last year\u2019s iPhone\u201d than this year.\nI used to think \u2014 and maybe it was even true \u2014 that one of the advantages to Apple of the tick-tock cycle is that during the S years, they\u2019re already experts at manufacturing a bunch of the components. That they\u2019ve already got a year of experience making that case, that display, those buttons. That manufacturing-wise, Apple could just swap in a few new components, like a new A-series CPU, and call it a day. But the iPhones 6S don\u2019t use the same case as last year\u2019s models. They\u2019re now made out of an altogether new \u201c7000 series\u201d aluminum alloy. This isn\u2019t just a new material that needs to be obtained in massive quantities, it also requires new CNC machining to carve and polish the frames. The displays are the same sizes as last year, but Apple is using a new glass that it calls \u201cthe strongest in the smartphone industry\u201d.2 Even the Touch ID sensor is new. Everything you can touch on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus is new.\nInternally, Apple has added force sensors to enable 3D Touch. They\u2019ve replaced the chintzy old vibrating engine with a \u201cTaptic\u201d engine. Both LTE and Wi-Fi now support faster speeds (and LTE supports more bands, increasing compatibility with networks around the world). The camera now supports 4K video and shoots better (and bigger) still photos. On the iPhone 6S Plus, image stabilization now works with video in addition to stills. The CPU and GPU improvements in the A9 system-on-a-chip are more dramatic compared to the A8 than the A8 was to the A7.\nApple has even \u2014 dare I say finally \u2014 increased the amount of RAM, from 1 GB to 2.\n\u201cThe Only Thing That\u2019s Changed Is Everything\u201d is the slogan of Apple\u2019s marketing campaign for the iPhones 6S. I can\u2019t beat that. I\u2019ve been testing both models for 12 days, and what Apple is saying about the new iPhones is true. They don\u2019t look new, but almost everything about them is new.\nI think it\u2019s backwards to think that in an S year, Apple simply takes the previous model and makes a few tweaks. Instead, I think what\u2019s obvious is that knowing the basic industrial design at least two years ahead of time gives the engineering teams inside Apple an opportunity to make significant changes to the components and the materials used to construct them. The timeline for iPhones, because of the massive scale at which they must be manufactured, is such that, right now, as I\u2019m typing this, the design for next year\u2019s iPhone 7 is either locked down or very close to it. The company will now spend the next year hustling to make it work and put it into production so it can start shipping a year from now. But that means there are also teams already at work on the iPhone 7S slated for 2017 \u2014 and they have a massive head start in terms of knowing the shape and dimensions of the device.\nBenchmarks\nAs usual, I\u2019ll leave in-depth performance analysis to others, but I did run the Geekbench 3 general-purpose benchmark. All devices were running the release version of iOS 9.0. I ran the benchmark three times after restarting the device, and put all devices in airplane mode during the tests. I\u2019ve rounded the scores to the nearest tens digit. For both the iPhone 6 and 6S, the scores for the 5.5-inch Plus models were effectively identical to the 4.7-inch models, so they aren\u2019t broken out separately.\nTest iPhone 5S iPhone 6 iPhone 6S 6S vs. 6 Factor Single Core 1360 1610 2500 1.6\u00d7 Multi-Core 2430 2890 4340 1.5\u00d7 Memory (Single) 1420 1650 2540 1.5\u00d7 Memory (Multi) 1770 1840 2560 1.4\u00d7\nTwo observations here. First, there is a noticeably bigger performance increase across the board going from the 6 to the 6S than there was last year, going from the 5S to the 6. In broad strokes, the non-S iPhones are about physical style, the S models are about performance. (At the introduction of the 3GS in 2009, Phil Schiller claimed the \u201cS\u201d stood for \u201cspeed\u201d. Since then, Apple hasn\u2019t said what any of the S\u2019s stand for, but \u201cspeed\u201d still fits)\nSecond, take a look at Geekbench\u2019s aggregate results for Android devices. (Here\u2019s a screenshot as it stands today, for posterity.) In terms of single-core performance, there isn\u2019t a single Android phone that beats the two-year-old iPhone 5S. Android devices fare better in multi-core benchmarks, because they have more cores (some have eight, many have four \u2014 the iPhones 6S still have only two cores), but single-core performance is a better measure for the sort of things you can feel while using a device. Apple is literally years ahead of the industry. Even if you don\u2019t agree that single-core performance is the more meaningful benchmark, you can\u2019t deny that iPhone benchmarks don\u2019t look anything like the benchmarks for high-end Android devices. With the Mac, Apple uses the same Intel chips as its PC competition. On mobile, though, Apple\u2019s in-house chip team has given the company a tremendous advantage over the rest of the industry.\nSpeaking of the Mac and performance, again looking at single-core performance, Geekbench results put the iPhone 6S at roughly the same score as a 2012 or 2013 MacBook Air. Even more intriguing is a comparison to the new single-port MacBook:\nTest iPhone 6S MacBook\n(1.3 GHz) MacBook\n(1.2 GHz) MacBook\n(1.1 GHz) Single Core 2500 2631 2420 2295 Multi-Core 4340 5268 5018 4464\nThe new iPhone 6S beats the new MacBook in single-core performance on Geekbench, and is within spitting distance in multi-core. That\u2019s astounding. I can\u2019t wait to see the scores for the iPad Pro later this year.\n3D Touch\n3D Touch can be used in a few ways:\nQuick Actions: The pop-up menu you see from the home screen when you press on an app icon. Peek and Pop: Press a little to get a peek, press harder to pop whatever you\u2019re peeking at open. This works mostly on list items. So in Mail, from your list of messages, you can peek to look at a message, then pop to open it all the way up. It works almost everywhere in Apple\u2019s own apps: Messages, Camera, Maps, Weather, Safari (page previews on links), Notes, Calendar, and more. It pays to explore. Multitasking: As an alternative to double-pressing the home button, you can now press on the left edge of the display. Press-and-swipe all the way across and you switch back to the previous app you were using. Press-and-swipe just a little and you\u2019re left in the \u201ccard view\u201d where you can switch to any previous application. The former is like hitting Command-Tab just once. The latter is like hitting Tab repeatedly while holding down the Command key. This is quickly addictive, and a great accommodation now that the iPhones are bigger than they used to be \u2014 you can switch between apps without changing your grip to allow your thumb to reach the Home button. Trackpad Mode: Press on the keyboard and it turns into a trackpad. iPads running iOS 9 can trigger this trackpad mode, too, with a two-finger swipe on the keyboard. Doing it with a single finger on the iPhone, though, is a tremendous boon to text editing. This might be the single best new feature for text editing on the iPhone since the addition of selection and Copy/Paste in iOS 3 in 2009. In addition to moving the insertion point around, you can press again and switch to selection mode \u2014 like double-clicking the mouse button on a Mac. Trackpad mode is a once-you\u2019ve-used-it-you-can\u2019t-go-back addition to iOS.\nThere are other uses for 3D Touch as well. When drawing in the new Notes app or using Markup to annotate an image in Mail, you can press harder to draw thicker strokes. (The same also applies when drawing Chinese characters on Chinese handwriting keyboards.) If you press on one of the new \u201cdynamic wallpapers\u201d on the lock screen, it animates for a few seconds, like a Live Photo. (Or you can set your lock screen wallpaper to a Live Photo you\u2019ve taken yourself. But Apple\u2019s \u201cdynamic wallpapers\u201d have a higher frame rate than the live photos you can take yourself; they\u2019re obviously like live photos, but they\u2019re not the same thing as the ones you can take with the iPhone 6S camera.)\nThe wallpaper animation is gimmicky, but fun. Most of the other uses for 3D Touch, though, are legitimate productivity gains. I find myself using the shortcuts on the icons for Messages (to jump to one of your three most-active recent threads) and Camera (to choose which mode to start in: front-facing self-portrait, video, slo-mo, or still) frequently. It\u2019s habit-forming.\nPeek-and-pop for, say, reading email \u2014 I wasn\u2019t too sure about that at first. But watching Tim Cook\u2019s appearance on Stephen Colbert, I took note when Cook claimed it helps him get through his inbox faster. I tried it again, and noticed for the first time that while peeking, you can slide the message left or right to trash or archive it. It really is an efficient way to triage messages, especially ones that you can\u2019t get the gist of from the two- or three-line preview in the message list itself. And, you can drag a message up to get an activity sheet with additional actions, like Reply, Forward, Notify Me, and more. The productivity gain with this workflow is that you don\u2019t have to go \u201cback\u201d after finishing. Peek, swipe to the side to archive, and it\u2019s gone. Anywhere you can peek, try sliding the peek around.\nI have only two bad things to say about 3D Touch. First, Apple missed an opportunity to borrow a great feature from Apple Watch. On Apple Watch, you can force touch in the notification list and you get an option to Clear All. 3D Touch has no effect in iOS 9\u2019s notification list, and there remains no way to clear all notifications at once.\nSecond, I find myself triggering the Quick Action menu inadvertently when I want to enter \u201cjiggle mode\u201d on the home screen, to either delete or move an app. Tap-and-wait long-pressing has always been a little frustrating to me. I don\u2019t like to wait. I\u2019m impatient. So when I go to move an app on the iPhone 6S, I press on it, and more often than not, I press hard enough to register as a 3D Touch. For apps that don\u2019t have any Quick Actions (which is to say, as of this writing, all third-party apps), what happens next is that you get a wee bit of haptic feedback to let you know your press registered as a 3D Touch event, but that there are no Quick Actions for this app. It feels like two very quick gentle taps. This haptic feedback is very clever. There is no alert, and no sound. Just that little feedback that feels like the haptic equivalent of your phone telling you \u201cUh-uh\u201d. But the experience is frustrating, because now it\u2019s taking me even longer to enter jiggle mode: first, without thinking about what I\u2019m doing, I accidentally trigger the \u201cUh-uh, no quick actions for this app\u201d 3D Touch. Then I have to let go, purposefully tap-and-hold gently, and wait. I expect to get used to this over time, but at this point, 3D Touch and long-pressing feel like they\u2019re at odds with each other.\nOverall, it seems very clear to me that 3D Touch will spread across the entire iOS device line. Like Touch ID and retina displays, it\u2019s simply debuting on the iPhone first.\nTaptic Engine\nSpeaking of the new Taptic Engine, it\u2019s excellent. It doesn\u2019t just provide for 3D Touch feedback, but it also serves as the vibrator for notifications. It is stronger, more noticeable, and in my opinion more pleasing than any previous iPhone vibrator. Back in 2011, Apple switched to a superior oscillating vibrator in the iPhone 4S (and the Verizon/CDMA iPhone 4). All previous iPhones used a cheaper rotational vibrator. The oscillating vibrator in the iPhone 4S was noticeably nicer. For whatever reason, Apple went back to a rotational vibrator in the iPhone 5, and stuck with it through the iPhone 6. The new taptic engine in the 6S feels as good or better than the old iPhone 4S vibrator. It\u2019s just stronger and more pleasing.\nThe 3D Touch feedback is well-designed. Peeks feel gentle, pops feel stronger \u2014 sort of like a half tap and a full tap. When you press something in the interface that has only one level of 3D Touch (like the Quick Action menu on a home screen icon), you get the full-strength tap feedback, which is a way of letting you know, by feel, that there\u2019s no reason to press harder. If you feel a peek, you know you can press hard to pop; if you feel a pop, you know you\u2019re done. Once you get used to it, peek/pop is as intuitive as the shutter button on a camera, where you can press halfway to engage autofocus and set the exposure, and press the rest of the way to take a picture.\nCamera\nSpeaking of which, the iPhone 6S cameras are terrific. They\u2019re fast, responsive, and accurate \u2014 accurate meaning that unedited, right off the camera roll, the color and light reproduction look like how the scene appeared to my eyes. More than any other aspect of the iPhone, the camera exemplifies the advantages of Apple\u2019s integration of hardware and software.\nI\u2019m still not sure what to make of the Live Photos feature. Is it a gimmick? I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m still shooting with the feature turned on. Technically, the way it seems to work is that the iPhone creates two files: a 12 MP JPEG (exactly the same as when you shoot a still image with Live Photo disabled), and a three-second-long MOV file. When looked at through Image Capture on a Mac running OS X 10.10.x, you see both files in the iPhone camera roll: \u201cIMG_1234.JPG\u201d and \u201cIMG_1234.MOV\u201d. Both files have same numeric index after the \u201cIMG_\u201d prefix, and both files have the same creation date. The MOV file is 1440 \u00d7 1080 pixels, at 12.77 frames-per-second.\nTechnically, of course, a MOV file is a video. But I think one of the reasons Apple is adamantly refusing to describe Live Photos as \u201cvideo\u201d is that these animated sidecars aren\u2019t high-quality videos in and of themselves. That they are video files, under the hood, is just an implementation detail.\nIt\u2019s also worth emphasizing that these Live Photos are not implemented by burst mode. You can still engage burst mode by holding down the shutter button, but you still only get about six or seven frames per second. When taking a burst of stills, Live Photo is disabled \u2014 you just get a regular series of still images, grouped together in the camera roll just like on the iPhone 6.\nSo the way Live Photo works, I think, is this: when you\u2019re in still photo mode with Live Photo turned on, the iPhone is constantly capturing 1440 \u00d7 1080 video at 12.77 FPS, but keeping only the most recent 1.5 seconds. Then when you tap the shutter to capture a still, it takes a 12-megapixel still image in between capturing frames of the video. Then the camera continues capturing another 1.5 seconds of video. So you wind up with 1.5 seconds of video prior to hitting the shutter, one still image at the maximum resolution of the image sensor, and another 1.5 seconds of video from after the shutter press. Because there is only one 12-megapixel still image captured, you can\u2019t change the \u201ckey frame\u201d of a Live Photo.\nIn iOS 9.0, the timing of this video capture is hard-coded. You get 3 seconds of video \u2014 1.5 seconds on each side of the still capture \u2014 every time. This means, however, if you snap your photo and then lower the camera, you wind up with a \u201cdroop\u201d at the end of your live photo animation \u2014 usually a blurry view of the floor. Apple has already addressed this in the betas for iOS 9.1. In 9.1, the camera will use the accelerometer to detect when you lower the camera after snapping a shot, and truncate the animation at that point. So in 9.0, all live photos are 3 seconds long, but many will have an unfortunate droop at the end. Starting in 9.1, live photos will be up to 3 seconds long, with no droops.\nYou cannot edit Live Photos. Well, you can edit them, but doing so turns them into stills.\nOne other camera feature demands mention, and it breaks my heart. Last year, the iPhone 6 Plus, and only the Plus, included optical image stabilization. This year, OIS remains a Plus-only feature, and Apple has made it even better, because it now works with video. The advantages of OIS for video are even greater than for still images, in my opinion. You know how when you watch a video someone shot on their phone \u2014 any phone \u2014 and when they walk around, you can see the picture rock up and down with each step they take? It\u2019s a signature of amateur video shot on consumer cameras, and it\u2019s unpleasant to say the least.\nOIS for video reduces this jerkiness. And in my testing on the iPhone 6S Plus, the effect is dramatic. It\u2019s a poor man\u2019s Steadicam, built right into the iPhone 6S Plus. I say that this breaks my heart because, personally, I have no interest in owning the 6S Plus \u2014 I much prefer the pocketability and feel-in-hand of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6S. I could tell myself last year that the 6 Plus\u2019s camera was only a wee bit better than the regular 6\u2019s, and only under certain conditions. This year, OIS for video means the iPhone 6S Plus is capable of something the regular 6S is not: shooting smooth full-size videos while you walk around or pan the camera.3\nLastly, I can\u2019t write about the camera without complaining that the bump for the lens is still there. I understand the physics and optics involved, but it bothers me every single day that I can feel that nubbin. The best argument for forgiving the camera bump is that a vast majority of iPhone owners use a case of some sort, and with a case, the camera bump is a non-issue. But for those of us who don\u2019t use cases, and who appreciate Apple\u2019s general attention to every little detail, it\u2019s a very minor but daily irritation. My number one hope for next year is that Apple can continue to improve image quality while somehow getting rid of the bump.\nMiscellany\nOne thing that hasn\u2019t changed from last year\u2019s iPhone 6 models: storage tiers of 16, 64, and 128 GB. The units I received for testing (one 6S, one 6S Plus) were both 128 GB. I\u2019m sure most people can get by easily with the 64 GB models. For anyone who is not completely certain that they don\u2019t need much storage, I would recommend against the 16 GB models. It\u2019s too easy to fill them up. I wish Apple had switched the baseline from 16 to 32 GB. 4K video is off by default (the default is 1080p at 30 FPS), but forget about shooting 4K with a 16 GB device. Apple says 4K video takes up 375 MB per minute. Here\u2019s the thing that nags me whenever I complain about these 16 GB phones. My gut feeling is that they\u2019re too small. Data from third-party app analytics suggests they\u2019re too small for many of the people who buy them. But Apple has more data on iPhone usage than anyone, and the company is obsessed with customer satisfaction. They measure customer satisfaction through surveys as accurately and scientifically as they can. How often does Tim Cook speak in public without the words \u201ccustomer sat\u201d coming out of his mouth? If last year\u2019s 16 GB baseline adversely affected customer satisfaction, you\u2019d think Apple would have done something about it this year, right? The only other explanation that makes sense is that it does adversely affect customer satisfaction, but they\u2019re willing to take the hit in the name of higher average selling prices, because of the people who wind up buying 64 GB models who would have bought a 32 GB model for $100 less if that had been an option. Again, to me, 16/64/128 is not good/better/best \u2014 it\u2019s OK/better/best.\nAlso seemingly unchanged from last year: the effective battery life of the device. I didn\u2019t perform any sort of battery life tests, but in heavy daily usage, the iPhone 6S felt like it got the same battery life as the iPhone 6 I\u2019ve been using for a year. No better, no worse. Like last year, the iPhone 6S Plus clearly gets way better battery life than the regular 6S, simply because it has room for a far larger battery.\nThe 6S models are heavier than last year\u2019s phones: the 6S is 14 grams heavier than the 6 (143/129g); the 6S Plus is 20 grams heavier than the 6 Plus (192/172g). Some of this might be due to the new Taptic Engine (which looks bigger in Apple\u2019s see-the-components promotional video) and the sensors for 3D Touch, but I presume most of the difference is due to the switch to higher-grade 7000-series aluminum. Well worth it for the additional structural integrity \u2014 I don\u2019t expect any complaints about bending this year. [ Update: According to The Verge, most of the weight gain is from the touch sensors in the new display assembly, not the aluminum.] This is subjective, but it seems to me that the new iPhones feel different to the touch. It\u2019s not dramatic, but I think they\u2019re less slippery. I\u2019ve gone case-less with every iPhone I\u2019ve owned, and the only one I\u2019ve ever dropped and had the screen crack was the iPhone 6. The larger size and rounded edges made the iPhone 6 less grip-able than my beloved old iPhone 5S. It could just be the extra weight, but in blind testing, I can feel the difference between my old iPhone 6 and the new 6S. It\u2019s just a wee bit more tacky, and it\u2019s either due to the material, or the wear and tear of a year\u2019s usage on my iPhone 6.\nApple is billing the new Touch ID sensor as \u201cup to 2\u00d7 faster\u201d. They\u2019re underselling it. It\u2019s so fast now that every single time I press it, it unlocks the phone, no matter how brief the contact is between my finger and the sensor. I can sit here and try to use the home button to get to the lock screen, and I can\u2019t unless I purposefully only touch a small portion of the button or use an unregistered finger. It\u2019s that fast. This actually takes some getting used it, if, like me, you sometimes use the home button just to get to the lock screen to check the date or time. With the new Touch ID sensor, the home button instantly unlocks the phone and I need to use the sleep/wake button to get to the lock screen.\nYou know those FCC-mandated regulatory logos etched on the back of your iPhone? They\u2019re gone. Last year the FCC issued new guidelines that allow manufacturers to put all these labels in software, for display on screen, and Apple has done just that. (You can see them in Settings: General: Regulatory.) It\u2019s such a little thing, but those little turds have always bothered me. Curiously, one previous iPhone also lacked these regulatory etchings: the Verizon iPhone 4. I have no idea why that one iPhone was able to omit them but subsequent ones were not. Replacing the regulatory turds is a simple \u201cS\u201d under the \u201ciPhone\u201d on the back of the phone. Previous S-model iPhones were not labeled as such.\nI don\u2019t plan to use one, but Apple\u2019s new cases are very nice. Both the silicone and leather cases come in nicer colors than last year \u2014 and they complement/match Apple\u2019s lineup of Sport and leather straps for Apple Watch nicely. They really seem to have upped their game with leatherwork. Just for kicks I spent a few days of my review period with the iPhone 6S in the saddle brown case, and I really liked the way it looked and felt. It seems like the sort of leather that will look better as it ages. The biggest thing keeping me from using this case for real, going forward, is that the raised edge along the side of the display gets in the way of performing edge-based gestures, primarily swiping to go back, and the new press-and-swipe to switch between apps with 3D Touch.\nThe Bottom Line\nNew-number iPhones (4, 5, 6) are about showing off Apple\u2019s design prowess. The S models are about showing off Apple\u2019s engineering prowess. Storage capacities and battery life are unchanged from last year\u2019s iPhones. Everything else \u2014 the materials they\u2019re made from, the performance of their custom CPU/GPU, the quality of the cameras, the smoothness of the user interface \u2014 is noticeably, tangibly improved.",

        "body": "After the new fourth-generation Apple TV was announced on September 9, Apple provided developers with Apple TV Dev Kits to be used to create tvOS apps for the device. Teardown site iFixit took apart one of those Apple TV units meant for developers and has now run into some repercussions for doing so.\nAccording to a post on the iFixit blog, the teardown, which unveiled all of the internal components of the new Apple TV, violated Apple's terms and conditions. As a result, iFixit's developer account was banned, leading to the removal of the iFixit app from the App Store.\niFixit's Apple TV unit was sent directly from Apple with the same restrictions placed on Apple TV units sent to other developers, but iFixit ignored the fine print. \"We weighed the risks, blithely tossed those risks over our shoulder, and tore down the Apple TV anyway,\" reads the blog post.\nA few days later, we got an email from Apple informing us that we violated their terms and conditions--and the offending developer account had been banned. Unfortunately, iFixit's app was tied to that same account, so Apple pulled the app as well. Their justification was that we had taken \"actions that may hinder the performance or intended use of the App Store, B2B Program, or the Program.\" Live and learn.\nWith the iFixit app removed from the Apple Store, iFixit is instead planning to revamp its mobile website and does not have plans to rewrite the app. The decision to focus on the iFixit mobile site came before the app was pulled by Apple, so it was not a huge loss to iFixit. The site says the app was outdated and riddled with bugs caused by iOS 9.\nFollowing the release of Apple TV Developer Kits, many other developers shared photos, unboxings, and feature tidbits about the device. It is unknown if Apple has also contacted these developers about non-disclosure violations.",

However, the case once again demonstrates the opposition that exists within government to Apple\u2019s stance on user privacy.\nIn a previous open letter, F.B.I. director James Comey argued that the top-notch security on devices like the iPhone have potential to aid terrorist groups like ISIS.\nTim Cook, meanwhile, has argued that Apple is taking a moral stance by not mining user data. In an interview with the Telegraph newspaper in the U.K., Cook commented that:\n\u201cNone of us should accept that the government or a company or anybody should have access to all of our private information.

        "body": "I\u2019ve pulled Peace from the App Store. I\u2019m sorry to all of my fans and customers who bought this on my name, expecting it to be supported for longer than two days. It\u2019ll keep working for a long time if you already have it, but with no updates.\nIf you want a refund, here\u2019s how you do that.\nUpdate: Apple is refunding all purchases automatically.\nAs I write this, Peace has been the number one paid app in the U.S. App Store for about 36 hours. It\u2019s a massive achievement that should be the highlight of my professional career. If Overcast even broke the top 100, I\u2019d be over the moon.\nAchieving this much success with Peace just doesn\u2019t feel good, which I didn\u2019t anticipate, but probably should have. Ad blockers come with an important asterisk: while they do benefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don\u2019t deserve the hit.\nPeace required that all ads be treated the same \u2014 all-or-nothing enforcement for decisions that aren\u2019t black and white. This approach is too blunt, and Ghostery and I have both decided that it doesn\u2019t serve our goals or beliefs well enough. If we\u2019re going to effect positive change overall, a more nuanced, complex approach is required than what I can bring in a simple iOS app.\nI still believe that ad blockers are necessary today, and I still think Ghostery is the best one, but I\u2019ve learned over the last few crazy days that I don\u2019t feel good making one and being the arbiter of what\u2019s blocked.\nAd-blocking is a kind of war \u2014 a first-world, low-stakes, both-sides-are-fortunate-to-have-this-kind-of-problem war, but a war nonetheless, with damage hitting both sides. I see war in the Tao Te Ching sense: it should be avoided when possible; when that isn\u2019t possible, war should be entered solemnly, not celebrated.\nEven though I\u2019m \u201cwinning\u201d, I\u2019ve enjoyed none of it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m withdrawing from the market.\nIt\u2019s simply not worth it. I\u2019m incredibly fortunate to be able to turn away an opportunity like this, and I don\u2019t begrudge anyone else who wants to try it. I\u2019m just not built for this business.\nI suggest you use Ghostery on the desktop and one of these competitors on iOS instead, both of which are good apps that were probably about to surpass Peace anyway:\nAnd again, if you want a refund on Peace, here\u2019s how to get it.\nI know pulling Peace from the store after just two days is going to be an immensely unpopular move, and subject me to a torrent of unpleasantness. But that\u2019ll end soon enough, and that\u2019s better than how I\u2019d feel if I kept going.\nLast night, in an effort to improve my morale, I did some low-level technical work on Overcast, which I greatly enjoy. It was a breath of fresh air: rather than a tricky business of messy distinctions and low technical challenge, I got to engage the technical part of my brain and make something great that doesn\u2019t hurt anyone, with no asterisks or qualifications.\nThat\u2019s my peace.",

        "title": "iPhone 6S announced: 3D Touch, 12-megapixel rear camera, rose gold finish, available September 25th for $199",
        "body": "Apple is putting a 12-megapixel rear camera in the new iPhone. This is the first time that Apple has bumped its camera's megapixel count since the iPhone 4S in 2011. It's long held that it wasn't worth adding pixels because it would lead to noisier images, but Apple claims that it's now managed to make the change without doing that. The camera is also now capable of recording 4K video, and it's supposed to have an improved autofocus in all cases. It also says that the camera has an improved autofocus. One thing that hasn't changed? The lens still protrudes from the back of the phone.\n5MP front camera and a flash for selfies\nThe front camera is getting a change, too. It's now a 5-megapixel camera, and Apple has figured out a neat way of giving it a flash: the phone's display just lights up really bright \u2014 apparently up to three times brighter than it usually would. It'll also customize the color that it flashes to match the ambient lighting of the environment a photo is being taken in.\nYou're also going to be taking a lot more videos with this new phone. Apple is introducing a feature called \"live photos,\" which will capture a short clip of video alongside every photo that you take. You can turn the feature off, but it's on by default, capturing a second and a half to both sides of every photo. A 12 megapixel image is still captured right in the middle. It's a pretty neat idea \u2014 even if HTC and others tried features like this years ago \u2014 but there's one reason to be worried about it: storage. All that video is going to take up a lot of space, regardless of how \"space efficient\" Apple claims they'll be.\nA pricing plan is, strangely enough, among the most interesting announcements\nApple is also demonstrating new animated wallpapers on the phone \u2014 those may be part of iOS 9 in general, however.\nThe iPhone 6S is also supposed to be getting faster wireless speeds over both Wi-Fi and LTE. Apple says that Wi-Fi should be twice as fast, and LTE is improving with the addition of more bands, now up to 23. Touch ID is also supposed to be improved on this model of the iPhone. Apple didn't go into a lot of detail there, but presumably it'll be faster or more accurate than the sensor on the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6.\nThe new iPhone will be available starting at $199 on a two-year contract, starting at 16GB of storage and going up to 64GB and 128GB for $100 more per tier. But most carriers are moving away from two-year contracts and over to payment plans now, so Apple is offering some of those, too. The 6S will be available for $27 per month. But there's another more interesting payment plan: for $32 per month, you can lease an iPhone and then return it for a new model every single year. It also includes the AppleCare+ warranty from Apple. Preorders begin September 12th, with sales beginning September 25th.\nSee all of the Apple news right here!",

        "title": "New Apple TV Will Feature Universal Search, Start At $149",
        "body": "On Wednesday, Sept. 9, Apple will unveil its next-generation Apple TV, as we've already told you. And, as we've also already told you, the device is a significant overhaul of its hoary predecessor, with more powerful innards and a new remote that sources say has been \"drastically improved\" by a touchpad input and, as first reported by TechCrunch and independently confirmed by BuzzFeed, motion sensors that will allow it to function as game controller.\nThat's the hardware. As for software, the forthcoming Apple TV will debut with a number of big features we reported back in March \u2014 an App Store of its own and Siri integration that will support what sources in position to know describe as \"some pretty hardcore voice control.\" Recall that Siri figures prominently in Apple's invitation to its upcoming event.\nBut there's another tentpole feature coming to the new Apple TV as well \u2014 and it's one for which anyone with the old Apple TV has been pining for years.\nUniversal search.\nEssentially, you'll be able to search for a show or movie once, and see results from all sorts of different sources.\nSources familiar with Apple's plans say that a cornerstone of the the company's new set-top box is a universal search feature that will enable searches across multiple streaming video services as well as Apple's iTunes Store. Instead of searching the catalogs of multiple video services one at a time for a particular movie, you'll now be able to search all \u2014 or most of them \u2014 at once and then choose the service on which you'd like to watch it. You'll also be able to search for actors and directors, and run other more targeted searches as well \u2014 all with Siri. While Apple's intelligent personal assistant is core to this feature, sources say there's another engine driving it as well \u2014 Matcha, the video discovery startup Apple acquired back in 2013. iOS 9's \"Proactive\" search is also likely part of the mix here, as 9to5Mac reported.\nUniversal search will dramatically improve the Apple TV experience, which has suffered for years from a largely text-based, frustrating, and not nearly as intuitive as it once was user interface. It's a big deal, and it will very clearly position the Apple TV as an entryway for video consumption from all kinds of different sources and services.\nIn many ways, this makes the forthcoming Apple TV the first \"true\" Apple TV in that it's the first to really begin delivering on Apple's vision of what the TV viewing experience should be.\nOne last thing: The new Apple TV will start at $149, the lower of the two price points 9to5Mac first reported. Apple will soon have a subscription internet TV service to sell and the faster it ramps up its installed base of new Apple TV households, the better.\nApple declined comment.",

        "title": "Every major Tech company but Apple (Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla) And Others Partner To Create Next-Gen Open Video Format",
        "body": "Amazon, Cisco, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla and Netflix today announced that they have formed a new open source alliance \u2014 the Alliance for Open Media \u2014 with the goal of developing the next generation of royalty-free video formats, codecs and other related technologies.\nIt\u2019s not often we see these rival companies come together to build a new technology together, but the members argue that this kind of alliance is necessary to create a new interoperable video standard that will work across vendors and platforms. While it goes unmentioned in the announcement, it\u2019s also clear that none of the members involved in this alliance want to have to pay royalties to the likes of MPEG LA.\nAs Mozilla notes, part of the reason for forming this alliance is not just to share technology, but also to \u201crun the kind of patent analysis necessary to build a next-generation royalty-free video codec.\u201d\nThere is no dearth of royalty-free next-gen codec projects, of course. Mozilla has Daala, Cisco has Thor, and Google is working on VP9 and 10. It\u2019s no surprise then that the Alliance\u2019s first project is to create a new video codec specification that\u2019s based on the previous work of its members.\nThis work is part of the larger effort of creating a format that\u2019s open and interoperable, as well as optimized for the web and scalable to any device and bandwidth. The format is also meant to support real-time video delivery and usable for commercial and non-commercial content. This last part is important, because this means the format will offer support for content encryption \u2014 something Amazon, Netflix and others have to support in order to be able to get the licensing rights for most of their content.\nThe group plans to publish its code under the Apache 2.0 license and it will operate under W3C patent rules, meaning the members will waive royalties from the codec implementations and their patents on the codec itself.",

        "title": "Apple Releases watchOS 2",
        "body": "Apple just released the final version of watchOS 2. The updated operating system is now available to download for everyone. It is available as an over-the-air update. You may not see the update right away as it takes a few minutes to hit all the servers. Apple may also be using a queue system to ensure speedy downloads.\nAs a reminder, Apple initially planned to release watchOS 2 on September 16. But the company had to delay the release at the last minute due to an unexpected bug.\n\u201cWe have discovered a bug in development of watchOS 2 that is taking a bit longer to fix than we expected,\u201d an Apple spokesperson told TechCrunch at the time. \u201cWe will not release watchOS 2 today but will shortly.\u201d But now everything is fixed.\nThe updated operating system adds a handful of features just five months after Apple launched the Apple Watch. In particular, app developers can now build native apps and take advantage of all the sensors with watchOS 2. Other features include transit directions, expanded Siri support, a few new watch faces, third-party complications, a night stand mode, the ability to go forward in time to check the weather, appointments and more. Read more in our full review.\nHere\u2019s how you can update to watchOS 2. Open the Watch app on your iPhone, go to \u2018General\u2019 then \u2018Software Update.\u2019 Apple should then prompt you to update.\nThere\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t update to watchOS 2. In many ways, it feels like the Apple Watch was in beta, and watchOS 2 is the final version of Apple\u2019s vision. Things load faster, developers are going to take advantage of the new features and everything is more reliable.",

        "title": "The Apple iOS 9 Review",
        "body": "2015 has been a pretty big year for Apple as a company. Product launches this year included the Apple Watch, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, the iPad Mini 4, the iPad Pro, and the new Apple TV. This month is a big month for their software launches, with today marking the release of iOS 9 as well as watchOS 2, and OS X El Capitan launching at the very end of the month. In time I hope to do some sort of review of the new features in watchOS 2, but today's article focuses strictly on iOS 9 and everything new that Apple is bringing to their biggest operating system for both users and developers.\nWhat's interesting about iOS 9 is how Apple has involved their community of users in the development process by creating a public beta program. OS X Yosemite famously was the first version of OS X to have a public beta (with the exception of the OS X 10.1 Kodiak beta 15 years ago), but Apple had never done anything like it for their mobile devices until now. However, many users found ways to install the developer betas of iOS on their devices by bypassing the activation or having a service register their UDID for beta installation. With more and more features being added to iOS, and more and more users adopting devices that run it, it appears that Apple felt that expanding their beta user base beyond developers would be a good way to collect information on bugs and stability, as well as general feedback about what does and doesn't work well.\nOpening up iOS 9 with a public beta also plays into the focus of the new release. iOS 7 was an enormous release that redesigned the entire operating system, and iOS 8 added features like continuity and extensibility to improve how apps communicated on iOS, and how iOS devices and Macs communicate with each other. With all those changes there has been concern that there hasn't been enough attention to polish and eliminating bugs in iOS. While it's not something explicitly stated, it's clear that iOS 9 does go back to basics in some ways, and focuses on improving performance and stability. There are still new features, and some of them are very integral to keeping iOS competitive as a mobile platform, but the key focus is on solidifying the existing foundations.\nThe polish and improvements that will be most obvious to the end user are those that involve visual or functional changes to the apps they use on a daily basis. With that in mind, it makes most sense to start off the review by taking a look at some of the general changes made to the UI and the system in iOS 9, so let's dive in.\nTable Of Contents",
