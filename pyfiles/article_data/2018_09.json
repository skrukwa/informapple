        "title": "In customer survey, better battery life tops list of most wanted iPhone features, \u2018remove the notch\u2019 comes dead last",
        "body": "Thanks to the relentless rumor mill, we already have a decent idea what features to expect from the iPhone XS and iPhone 9 (final name TBA) when they are unveiled on September 12. As the iPhone X closes in on retirement, USA Today/SurveyMonkey conducted a survey of 1,665 US adults to ask what customers most want.\nThe iPhone X\u2019s notched screen was controversial when it debuted last year, but has become mostly accepted by critics over time (and has now been copied for almost every new Android phone outside of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy devices). This survey says customers don\u2019t care that much either; \u2018remove the notch\u2019 was picked by 10 percent of respondents, the lowest feature request on the list. It probably isn\u2019t too hard to guess what come in at the top spot \u2026\nSure enough, a whopping 75 percent of respondents wanted new iPhones to offer better battery life. Despite generations of technical advancement on other features, battery technology has not advanced much in recent years and iPhones can still struggle to last a full working day with normal usage.\nWith iPhone X, Apple actually uses a two-cell L-shaped battery to maximise internal capacity. The iPhone is also 7.7mm thin, which is the thickest iPhone since the iPhone 5. However, customer surveys continue to show that people (at least think they) would trade a little less portability for a couple extra hours of juice.\nFor iPhone XS, we aren\u2019t expecting any major leaps but it is possible that the larger 6.5-inch iPhone XS does tout more hours of usage time, as the device chassis grows disproportionately to the additional power draw of the bigger screen area.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that wireless charging is an alternative answer to the problem of having your iPhone last all day. With wireless Qi pads dotted around your house/office, it becomes a lot easier to keep your phone topped up. We are still waiting for Apple to launch the AirPower mat, with the September event marking a year since AirPower was first announced (for \u20182018\u2019 availability).\nIn second place was durability: namely a shatter-proof screen. Corning recently announced the sixth-generation of its hardened glass, which could appear in the new iPhone models. However, a truly shatter-proof screen is still a fantasy than a reality. Physics.\nComing in third is expandable storage options, something Apple has consistently shown it is not interested in offering (and there are definitely complexities that come with expandable storage: file management etc). For iPhone XS, Apple is expected to offer a 512 GB iPhone option for the first time. This helps people who are craving more local storage space, but it will no doubt cost a fortune and obviously can\u2019t be expanded later.\nThe infamous headphone jack removal still appears to play on customer\u2019s mind, coming in with 37 percent of the vote. People are still upset that it is nigh-impossible to charge a modern iPhone and listen to music with wired headphones at the same time. Apple, of course, is pushing towards a wireless headphone future here with products like the AirPods.\nThere is also some USB-C love in this survey (29 percent), along with improvements to Face ID recognition, and general speed gains. In a separate question where customers were asked to pick just one feature, better battery life still won out with more than a third of the votes.\nThe classic adage is that \u2018customers don\u2019t know what they want\u2019 and it\u2019s certainly true that Apple could release new iPhones that do not address any of these points and still comprise compelling updates for consumers. Live Photos or Portrait Mode are examples of features that no survey would have ever demanded, but have clearly been a big hit. Nevertheless, it\u2019s interesting to check in with surveys like this to get a general barometer on the average of customer complaints and wishes.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "body": "As it\u2019s been learned over the years, Google pays Apple to remain the default search engine in Safari on iOS. While neither company publicly speaks on the agreement, analysts believe payments are made in the billions.\nAccording to analyst Rod Hall (via Business Insider), Google may be paying Apple upwards of $9 billion this year to remain the default search engine for Apple\u2019s Safari browser on iOS. Hall believes that this number will only continue to grow, potentially leading to a payment of $12 billion in 2019.\nThe relationship between Google and Apple has always been interesting. While Apple uses Google as the default search engine in Safari on iOS, the company also uses Bing in various other places such as searching the web via Siri. Despite this, Hall says that \u201cApple is one of the biggest channels of traffic acquisition for Google.\u201d\nRecently, Apple has been touting that services will be a huge area of growth for the company, as sales of its hardware start to peak. Apple Music has seen steady growth since its inception back in 2015. While the free iCloud storage tier still remains at just 5GB, more users are now willing to pay the monthly fee to get access to more storage.\nRelated stories:\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "body": "Reviews suggest that the iPhone XS camera is a significant upgrade on the one in last year\u2019s iPhone X \u2013 but some owners are complaining that the front-facing camera comes with one upgrade that is unwanted and can\u2019t be switched off.\nThe selfie camera is reportedly applying heavy and unrealistic skin smoothing \u2026\nOne thread begins with a close crop of skin smoothing which is so heavy it makes the shot look out of focus.\niPhone XS is applying skin smoothing/beauty filter on the front facing camera without telling you and no way to disable it. This is not acceptable.\nOthers quickly chimed in with complaints.\nWhen you compromise the integrity of the camera without telling anybody and no option to turn it off, you\u2019re deliberately selling consumers a gimped product. Also, it\u2019s just not possible than a filter algorithm can work 100% in a blanket way. It\u2019ll probably lead to the uncanny valley effect.\nSeveral suggest that the filter makes caucasian skin appear orange.\nThe \u201cfilter\u201d looks so **** as well. It\u2019s like really poor photoshopping by someone trying to \u201cairbrush\u201d with no clue about how to subtly touch up a photo. Hint: caucasian skins aren\u2019t dayglo orange. Mine almost makes me look like I\u2019m a character from the sims.\nMany compare the effect to a Snapchat filter.\nI just got my phone and love it, but when I opened the camera app to the front facing camera, my face looked like it had a Snapchat filter on it. My skin looks too smooth. I am so frustrated with this camera. I look stupid in snaps. It looks like I\u2019m using an air brush filter. Please find solution to this\nLewis Hilsenteger from the Unbox Therapy YouTube channel even made an entire video about it (below).\niPhone XS portrait seems like it\u2019s doing more aggressive skin smoothing [\u2026] Somehow the device was putting me in some kind of automatic beauty mode or something.\nBusiness Insider notes some are referring to the phenomenon as \u2018beautygate.\u2019 Are you seeing this in your own selfies? Let us know in the comments below, and any sample photos would be great.\nUpdate: Abdul Dremali, whose photos are shown above, told us that \u2018Apple reached out to me yesterday and are working on this issue actively.\u2019",

The data suggests customers are adopting iOS 12 at a slower rate than iOS 11 and iOS 10.\nLast year, iOS 11 was installed on 10 percent of devices just 24 hours after launching, and in 2016, iOS 10 was installed on 14.45 percent of devices within 24 hours.\nCustomers may be reluctant to adopt a new operating system after all of the bugs and issues that were seen with iOS 11 software updates, but Apple made an effort to focus on the underlying code of iOS 12 and thus far, the update has been stable.\nAs should be no surprise, MacRumors readers are early iOS 12 adopters. Over 80 percent of readers queried so far have installed iOS 12 just two days after it launched. Follow us on Twitter and vote to let us know if you've upgraded to iOS 12.\nDid you install iOS 12 yet? \u2014 MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) September 19, 2018\niOS 12 is an update that brings significant speed and performance improvements to older devices, so most customers installing the software should see notable speed improvements over iOS 11 after updating.\nOn the iPhone 6 Plus, for example, apps launch up to 40 percent faster, while the keyboard can appear up to 50 percent faster. Opening the camera on the Lock screen to take a photo can be done 70 percent faster.\nApple has made animations smoother and more responsive across the operating system, so accessing Control Center, scrolling in apps, or swiping up when multitasking feels more fluid.\niOS 12 also includes optimizations for when the operating system is under load. Apps launch up to twice as fast under a heavy load, as does the Share Sheet.\nWith iOS 12 installed on 10 percent of devices, iOS 11 adoption has dipped to 82 percent and will continue to fall as more people adopt iOS 12. Installation could jump this weekend as some people wait until they have a free block of time to complete a major software update.\niOS 12 is a free download that's available for the iPhone 5s and later, iPad mini 2 and later, and the 6th-generation iPod touch. In addition to noticeable and useful speed and performance improvements, the update introduces Screen Time for monitoring device usage, Memoji and new Animoji, ARKit 2.0, and a new Shortcuts app for creating customized automations.

        "title": "No. 1 paid utility in Mac App Store steals browser history, sends it to Chinese server",
        "body": "[Update 8:54 am PT: Apple has pulled Adware Doctor from the Mac App Store. See below for more.]\nAdware Doctor, the number one paid utility in the Mac App Store, is secretly logging the browser history of users, and sending it to a server in China.\nSecurity researcher Patrick Wardle says that he notified Apple of this a month ago, but the malware app still remains available in the Mac App Store today \u2026\nThreatpost notes that everything about the app would appear legitimate.\nThe app is currently listed on Apple\u2019s Mac App Store as the company\u2019s fourth-highest \u201cTop Paid\u201d software programs, behind Final Cut Pro, Magnet and Logic Pro X. It is also the store\u2019s No. 1 paid utility. The app currently costs $4.99, is validly signed by Apple, and its listing on the Mac App Store is accompanied a majority of lavishly positive [likely fake] five-star reviews. Adware Doctor promotes its app as preventing \u201cmalware and malicious files from infecting your Mac.\u201d\nThe app originally posed as Adware Medic, an app owned by Malwarebytes (and subsequently renamed to Malwarebytes for Mac), leading Apple to pull it. But when it changed its name to Adware Doctor, Apple allowed it back into the App Store.\nWardle did a deep dive into the app to find out what it was doing, after being alerted to it by Privacy 1st.\nHe found that the app creates a password-protected archive called history.zip. It then uploads that file to a server which appears to be based in China. Wardle found that the password was hard-coded, enabling him to open the zip file and examine its contents. He found that it contained browser history from Chrome, Firefox and \u2013 yes \u2013 Safari.\nWardle notes that sandboxing ought to prevent Mac apps getting access to data belonging to other apps, but that Adware Doctor requests universal access when first run \u2013 which would be expected to allow a malware scan, so wouldn\u2019t appear suspicious. However, he found that the app was also able to access running processes, something that sandboxing should still prevent.\nIronically, he found that the app circumvents this protection by using Apple\u2019s own code.\nIt\u2019s (likely) just a copy and paste of Apple\u2019s GetBSDProcessList code (found in Technical Q&A QA1123 \u201cGetting List of All Processes on Mac OS X\u201d). Apparently this is how one can get a process listing from within the application sandbox! I\u2019m guessing this method is unsanctioned (as it clearly goes against the design goals of sandbox isolation). And yes, rather amusing the code Adware Doctor uses to skirt the sandbox, is directly from Apple!\nThe app also logs the apps you\u2019ve downloaded, and their source.\nAs of the time of writing, the server collecting the data is offline, possibly as a result of the attention it has now received, but it could be easily reactivated.\nWardle says his greatest concern is why Apple has left the malware in the Mac App Store a month after he alerted the company to his findings.\nUpdate: We understand Apple\u2019s view is that the app doesn\u2019t defeat sandboxing, since the intention is to ensure users are in control of what apps can and can\u2019t do, and it is users who granted permission. That said, macOS Mojave does increase sandboxing protections, so that even if a user grants permission for total access, it will still protect sensitive information like Safari history and cookies.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Apple can delete purchased movies from your library without telling you - when you buy a movie on iTunes, it\u2019s yours forever, until such a time as when Apple maybe loses the rights to distribute it, and then it will disappear from your library without a trace",
        "body": "When you buy a movie on iTunes, it\u2019s yours forever, until such a time as when Apple maybe loses the rights to distribute it, and then it will disappear from your library without a trace. This is what happened to Anders G. da Silva, who goes by @drandersgs on Twitter, and who tweeted about losing three movies bought on the iTunes Store.\nWhen da Silva wrote to Apple to complain about the missing movies, Apple wrote back to him that \u201cthe content provider has removed these movies from the Canadian Store. Hence, these movies are not available in the Canada iTunes Store at this time.\u201d For his trouble in notifying Apple that it had disappeared three of his ostensible belongings for incredibly dubious legal reasons, Apple offered da Silva not even a refund, but two credits for renting a movie on the iTunes Store \u201cpriced up to $5.99 USD.\u201d After he argued that he was not in the market for rentals and would just like the movies he purchased, please, Apple tried to appease him with two more rental credits.\nTo be completely fair, the iTunes Store\u2019s Terms of Service, which surely no one has ever read, do address this kind of incident. Years ago, Apple began offering \u201ccloud storage\u201d for content purchased from its store, meaning that if a user deleted the content from any device, it could be re-downloaded to that same device, or a different authorized device, later.\nMe: Hey Apple, three movies I bought disappeared from my iTunes library.\nApple: Oh yes, those are not available anymore. Thank you for buying them. Here are two movie rentals on us!\nMe: Wait... WHAT?? @tim_cook when did this become acceptable? pic.twitter.com/dHJ0wMSQH9 \u2014 Anders G da Silva (@drandersgs) September 10, 2018\nMe: I see... So, that \"Buy\" button is meaningless? It should maybe be called: \"Feelin Lucky?\"\nApple: I see you are unhappy. Have two more rentals on us.\n3/7 \u2014 Anders G da Silva (@drandersgs) September 11, 2018\n\u201cYou may be able to redownload previously acquired Content (\u2018Redownload\u2019) to your devices that are signed in with the same Apple ID (\u2018Associated Devices\u2019),\u201d says the TOS, but also, \u201cContent may not be available for Redownload if that Content is no longer offered on our Services.\u201d For reasons that are easy to guess, Apple has never widely advertised that, by deleting locally stored content, users are actually rolling the dice as to whether they will ever be able to get it back.\nThis is not the first time tech overlords have made digital content rights inconsistent with any person\u2019s normal understanding of what a \u201cpurchase\u201d is. Back in 2009, Amazon customers noticed that their copies of 1984 and Animal Farm by George Orwell were suddenly missing. It turned out the copies were created by a seller that did not have the rights to the books, and when Amazon found this out, it pulled the books directly off of all the Kindles that had downloaded them. Later, the company acknowledged this was maybe not the best course of action.\nIn 2012, Amazon decided to terminate the account of another user who then lost access to 43 Kindle books she had purchased. When she protested, Amazon\u2019s UK arm chided her, \u201cAmazon.co.uk and its affiliates reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders at their sole discretion.\u201d\nAs da Silva and others have pointed out before, the \u201cBuy\u201d button in digital stores is, at best, mislabeled. You cannot truly buy any digital thing online; you can only rent it, and any online video store is little more than an expensive, glorified, extremely convenient Blockbuster. In conclusion, let\u2019s go back to DVDs. We have requested comment from Apple and will update if we hear back.\nUpdate 9/17/2018 2:50PM: By way of explanation, an Apple PR representative sent me this link, which explains that the reason da Silva can\u2019t access the movies he paid real dollars for is that they are stuck on a different region of the iTunes Store (Canada vs. Australia); to access the movies, he simply needs to relinquish his Australian iTunes Store subscriptions and credits, obtain a Canadian billing address and a Canadian credit card, switch back over to the store, hope the movies are still available, redownload them in a secure location and locally store them when Apple claims you don\u2019t need to do this, and then undo all of the settings so he can go back to his new native iTunes Store of Australia. Apple, appearing to have finally realized some elements of this are absolutely ridiculous, is \u201cpromising to send him a workaround.\u201d Blessings to the company for clarifying.",

        "body": "Apple\u2019s latest mobile operating system, iOS 12, was released to the public earlier today, and that means it\u2019s a great time to get well acquainted with some of its more useful new features. One of those is Password Autofill, a password manager tool that lets you store login credentials for the dozens of apps and services you likely access more on mobile today than ever before.\nEven better: Apple will let you import password data from third-party providers so you don\u2019t have to solely use its existing iCloud Keychain feature or give up using a trusted extension. Starting today with iOS 12\u2019s release, multiple services have released mobile updates that allow you to set them as Password Autofill\u2019s designated provider. Among the more popular services to support the feature are 1Password, Dashlane, and LastPass, all of which now support the autofill feature by authenticating your identity using Face ID, Touch ID, or a separate pin code.\nThe way to enable this is to head over to Settings, scroll down to Passwords & Accounts, and tap on Autofill Passwords. From there, you can enable a third-party app like LastPass and disable iCloud Keychain if you like. Once you\u2019ve done that, open any app that doesn\u2019t keep you perpetually logged in, like a banking app for example, and you should see a \u201cPassword\u201d option next to a black key icon when you tap the credentials field. (Some mobile apps, like Bank of America\u2019s and PayPal\u2019s, will independently verify your identity using FaceID, obviating the need for Password Autofill in some cases.) Tapping it should fill in the necessary info from your password vault.",

        "body": "The New Yorker today published broad profile on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The profile dives into Zuckerberg\u2019s love of board games and winning, his role making crucial decisions at the helm of Facebook, and more. For Apple specifically, the profile notes how Apple\u2019s decisions can influence Facebook\u2019s.\nBack in July, Facebook took action against Alex Jones and Infowars after mounting pressure due to Jones\u2019 spreading of Sandy Hook conspiracy theories. But it was a relatively basic punishment, with Facebook only removing four of Jones\u2019 videos and handing him a one month ban, despite continued calls for his permanent ban.\nA week after Facebook\u2019s initial decision, Apple announced it had removed five Infowars podcasts due to hate speech. Shortly thereafter, Facebook announced its ban on Jones \u2013 and Zuckerberg now admits the decision was influenced by Apple.\nZuckerberg explained that Facebook doesn\u2019t ban people unless they are \u201cdirectly inciting violence.\u201d When Apple\u2019s decision to take action against Jones was made, Facebook was plotting what to do about growing user concern over older posts from Jones:\n\u201cThe initial questions were around misinformation.\u201d He added, \u201cWe don\u2019t take it down and ban people unless it\u2019s directly inciting violence.\u201d He told me that, after Jones was reduced, more complaints about him flooded in, alerting Facebook to older posts, and that the company was debating what to do when Apple announced its ban. Zuckerberg said, \u201cWhen they moved, it was, like, O.K., we shouldn\u2019t just be sitting on this content and these enforcement decisions. We should move on what we know violates the policy. We need to make a decision now.\u201d\nThe full piece from The New Yorker is definitely worth a read and does a great job of highlighting the many quirks to Facebook\u2019s increasingly powerful CEO.\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "body": "Apple turned against customers and its own employees after the death of co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs, a fired Apple engineer claims in a lawsuit.\n\u201cNo corporate responsibility exists at Apple since Mr. Jobs\u2019 death,\u201d Darren Eastman alleged in a lawsuit over his termination and patents related to his work at the Cupertino tech giant.\nApple declined to comment on the claims made in the lawsuit.\nEastman, who is representing himself in court, started working as an engineer for Apple in 2006, largely because Jobs was interested in his idea for a low-cost Mac for education, and wanted him hired straight out of graduate school, Eastman said in the filing. Eastman claims to have invented the \u201cFind my iPhone\u201d function.\nWhen Jobs headed Apple, he told Eastman to notify him of any unresolved problems with the company\u2019s products, and employees in general were expected to raise such concerns, Eastman said in a lawsuit filed Thursday in Santa Clara County Superior Court.\nThat changed after Jobs died in 2011, he claimed.\n\u201cMany talented employees who\u2019ve given part of their life for Apple were now regularly being disciplined and terminated for reporting issues they were expected to (report) during Mr. Jobs tenure,\u201d Eastman alleged in the filing.\n\u201cCronyism and a dedicated effort to ignore quality issues in current and future products became the most important projects to perpetuate the goal of ignoring the law and minimizing tax.\n\u201cComplying with the law and paying what\u2019s honestly required is taboo at Apple, with judicial orders and paying tax (of any kind) representing the principal frustration of Apple\u2019s executives.\u201d\nUnder the leadership of new CEO Tim Cook, the response to workers raising concerns is dramatically different from what occurred under Jobs, Eastman alleged.\n\u201cNotifying Mr. Cook about issues (previously welcomed by Mr. Jobs) produces either no response, or, a threatening one later by your direct manager,\u201d Eastman claimed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no accountability, with attempts at doing the right thing met with swift retaliation.\u201d\nIn 2014, a manager was fired after \u201csuggesting in a large meeting that a proposed project would cost millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of hours of labor without any success,\u201d Eastman alleged.\nThat fired manager\u2019s daughter, an Apple employee, was terminated soon after, for reporting toxic mold in the building where she worked, Eastman claimed.\n\u201cDespite contractors confirming the building could never be rid of mold, Apple signed a new multiyear lease, and, encouraged staff to return to the office after simply repainting,\u201d he claimed.\nIn sacking workers, timing was very important to Apple, Eastman claimed, alleging a \u201cdisturbing practice\u201d of illegally firing employees just before the end of the company\u2019s fiscal calendar.\n\u201cThis means that compensation due for the current (year\u2019s) work (including stock which may have taken multiple years to vest) is not granted,\u201d claimed Eastman, whose filing said he was terminated in 2014.\n\u201cThe stock can then be reallocated to other employees and becomes an added bonus for managers to terminate experienced staff \u2014 this keeps both salary and tax costs minimized.\u201d\nEngineers \u201cstarted to disappear suddenly\u201d when stock options were due or when a performance review was expected to trigger large bonuses or raises, Eastman claimed.\n\u201cApple evolved from an honest company into a rampant and regular abuser of contract, discrimination and employment law,\u201d Eastman claimed, \u201cin addition to regularly acting without good faith in business dealings.\u201d\nHe claimed he\u2019s been forced to represent himself in the case because Apple made sure he depleted his funds for legal representation.\n\u201cEven when Apple is presented with litigation, it files ridiculous motions which regularly challenge the rule of law and disrespect both the judiciary and due process,\u201d Eastman alleged.\nWith Apple management focused on \u201celiminating quality assurance and engineering positions,\u201d employees became tied up dealing with litigation, \u201coften for embarrassing and simple causes which never had previously happened at Apple,\u201d Eastman alleged.\n\u201cUpdates for every product are often untested, causing more significant issues than those they resolved \u2014 sometimes rendering applications or basic functionality to be completely unusable until another update fixes the regression,\u201d he claimed.\nHe was regularly assigned to help customers who wrote to company executives after being ignored by Apple, he claimed.\nHe would diagnose the problem at hand and come up with a solution, but his fixes never became updates, Eastman alleged. Customers he\u2019d dealt with ended up suing Apple, he claimed.\n\u201cThe executive team\u2019s main focus,\u201d Eastman claimed, \u201cis eliminating tax liability and bad PR being disseminated about Apple.\u201d\nEastman is seeking a re-grant of 735 shares of Apple common stock (worth about $165,000 in total as of Sept. 28), damages of $326,400 plus $32,640 in interest, and resolution of the alleged patent-ownership issue.",

        "title": "YSK: Apple\u2019s $29 battery replacement program ends on December 2018. If you believe your IPhone 6 or later is suffering from battery issues now is the time to get it replaced.",
        "body": "All rechargeable batteries are consumable components that become less effective as they chemically age.\nAs lithium-ion batteries chemically age, the amount of charge they can hold diminishes, resulting in shorter amounts of time before a device needs to be recharged. This can be referred to as the battery\u2019s maximum capacity \u2014 the measure of battery capacity relative to when it was new. In addition, a battery\u2019s ability to deliver maximum instantaneous performance, or \u201cpeak power,\u201d may decrease. In order for a phone to function properly, the electronics must be able to draw upon instantaneous power from the battery. One attribute that affects this instantaneous power delivery is the battery\u2019s impedance. A battery with a high impedance may be unable to provide sufficient power to the system that needs it. A battery's impedance can increase if a battery has a higher chemical age. A battery\u2019s impedance will temporarily increase at a low state of charge and in a cold temperature environment. When coupled with a higher chemical age, the impedance increase will be more significant. These are characteristics of battery chemistry that are common to all lithium-ion batteries in the industry.\nWhen power is pulled from a battery with a higher level of impedance, the battery\u2019s voltage will drop to a greater degree. Electronic components require a minimum voltage to properly operate. This includes the device\u2019s internal storage, power circuits, and the battery itself. The power management system determines the capability of the battery to supply this power, and manages the loads in order to maintain operations. When the operations can no longer be supported with the full capabilities of the power management system, the system will perform a shutdown to preserve these electronic components. While this shutdown is intentional from the device perspective, it may be unexpected by the user.",

In addition, the display company is preparing to begin mass-production of OLED panels at two manufacturing lines of its E6 plant, which have been operational only for a test run until recently.\nApple usually likes to split its component orders between at least two suppliers, both to improve the reliability of its supply chain and to improve its negotiating position. It would likely ideally want Samsung and LG to each make half the displays, even paying $2.7B for the company to create an iPhone-exclusive production line, but LG has reportedly been struggling to hit the volumes Apple wanted.\nReports have so far suggested that LG would make between two and five million screens in its initial production run.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

We are awaiting refreshed iPad Pro models with major upgrades like an edge-to-edge design with slimmer bezels and Face ID, along with updates to the MacBook, Mac mini, and other machines.\nBased on ASCI's numbers, Amazon is closing in on Apple with an ASCI score of 82, with customers satisfied with design, ease of operation, and sound/graphics quality on the company's line of tablets.\nSamsung tied with Amazon, also earning a score of 82. Samsung also scores well across the customer experience, but can't match Apple on features that include operating system, preloaded apps, and data storage.\nAccording to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, overall customer satisfaction with personal computers (a category that includes laptops, desktop machines, and tablets) continues to earn a score of 77 on the ACSI scale.\nSmartphones outpaced personal computers in customer satisfaction back in 2014, and customers continue to be more satisfied with their handheld devices, using them for more tasks that had previously been limited to computers.\nAmong PC owners, desktop machines earned the highest overall satisfaction score, followed by tablets and then laptops. Just 17 percent of respondents to the ACSI survey purchased a desktop computer in the last year, but customer satisfaction grew 4 percent. Satisfaction with tablets also grew 4 percent, while laptop satisfaction declined.\nTo create its scoring system and compile device scores, the ACSI uses data from interviews with approximately 250,000 customers each year, analyzing customer satisfaction with more than 380 companies across 46 industries.",

        "body": "Liquidation specialist B-Stock reported back in July that the average resale value of an iPhone X was 85% of the full retail price, a record for any iPhone at that point in the sales cycle.\nNote: You can quickly and easily get cash for your desk full of iPhones here with our highly rated service.\nA tech trade-in site says that today\u2019s trade-in value is still 68% of the original sales price even a week before this year\u2019s models are revealed, in strong contrast to one of Samsung\u2019s flagship phones \u2026\nWith the latest report suggesting that this year\u2019s iPhone X successor, expected to be called the XS or Xs, could start from $800, that could represent an opportunity for a very cheap upgrade to the new model if you have a spare phone you could use to span the gap.\nIn fact, says MusicMagpie, all iPhone models hold their value better than any of the competition. The iPhone X has depreciated 32%, the iPhone 8 Plus by 43%, the iPhone 8 45% and the iPhone 7 by 44%. This is in sharp contrast to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S9+, which has already lost almost half its value just five months after launch.\nOther Samsung models have depreciated by between 58% and 59%, with even worse news for other brands \u2013 as shown below.\nThe worst purchase of all was the HTC Desire 820, which lost 95% of its value in one year.\nPhoto: Reuters/Peter Nicholls\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "No, Apple didn't delete that guy's movies. Here's what really happened",
        "body": "Perhaps you've heard a story that goes like this:\n\"Apple's 'buy' button is a sham, because Apple has the right to remove movies from your iTunes library after you've bought them. If Disney decides it no longer wants to offer a particular movie in your country, your 'purchase' is no better than an extended rental. Only Blu-rays and DVDs are safe.\"\nHere's the thing: Some of that may be true. But the story about disappearing digital copies isn't. Or, at the very least, it's a lot more complicated than that.\nThough his tweets went viral, and though he did chat with Apple Support, the company didn't delete or actively \"remove\" the movies that disappeared from Anders Gon\u00e7alves da Silva's iTunes library and his devices. It seems to have been a more complicated mix-up, based on the fact that da Silva moved his residence from one country to another.\nMost importantly: Apple tells CNET that it won't delete your movies, either. At least, not ones you've downloaded.\nThe tweet that started it all\nIt's not too surprising that the original tweetstorm caught fire:\nIt's tough not to be outraged by a seemingly tone-deaf letter like the one above. \"A customer bought these movies, they're gone, and he's only getting a couple rentals in return?\"\nIndeed, dig deeper into Apple's Terms of Service, and you'll see that it quietly warns that you may not be able to redownload content if it's \"no longer offered on our Services.\" It's not hard to see why headlines like \"Apple can delete the movies you purchased without telling you\" started spreading around the web.\nBut take a closer look at da Silva's tweet, and there's something interesting going on. Apple Support thinks he's in Canada, while da Silva's Twitter profile and LinkedIn show he's from Australia. That's a rather large geographical difference.\nWhen we reached out to da Silva, he clarified the disparity: He moved to Canada, roughly nine months ago, after purchasing the films in Australia. Not only is that two separate countries, it's two separate iTunes Store regions. Perhaps Canada doesn't offer those films anymore, and that left him unable to access them in his new location?\n\"Content may not be available for Redownload if that Content is no longer offered on our Services.\" Screenshot by Sean Hollister/CNET\nThe thing is, those three titles -- Cars, Cars 2 and The Grand Budapest Hotel, according to da Silva -- are still available to purchase in both Australia and Canada, CNET confirmed. He could buy new \"Canada\" copies right now. So why are his \"Australia\" copies gone?\nAnd it doesn't seem to be a matter of Australian purchases not working in Canada, either. \"I have other purchases made while in Australia, and using the same Australian iTunes account, that are working perfectly fine,\" da Silva told CNET.\nGenerally, you can take iTunes purchases with you when you travel, though Apple's fine print does include a caveat in case they disappear:\nEnlarge Image The word \"might\" might be important here. Screenshot by Sean Hollister/CNET\nBut there's another possibility: Perhaps da Silva still has access to the Australian versions of these movies, but not the Canadian ones?\nApple's statement\nThat's certainly what Apple seemed to be hinting when we asked the company about it this weekend. Apple said:\n\"Any movies you've already downloaded can be enjoyed at any time and will not be deleted unless you've chosen to do so. If you change your country setting, some movies may not be available to redownload from the movie store if the version you purchased isn't also available in the new country. If needed, you can change your country setting back to your prior country to redownload those movies.\"\nSure, Apple's statement doesn't say exactly what happened to da Silva's movies, or admit that Apple Support may have made a mistake when parsing the original response. But it clearly states that the company doesn't delete movies without your permission -- and that you should even be able to redownload movies from your \"prior country\" if they're not available in the new one.\nTwo possible culprits\nMore likely, the phrase \"if the version you purchased isn't also available\" speaks volumes about what actually happened here. Few films have a single version sold throughout the world. For a variety of reasons, a movie may get trimmed in one country to get a more approachable rating (say, PG-13 in the US), or to cut politically or culturally sensitive content. And that's not even counting directors' cuts, in which multiple versions of the same film may be sold in the same region.\nThe other issue is that \"region hopping,\" a common tactic among film lovers worldwide to get earlier or different versions of movies, is becoming harder and harder. So, even when someone has legitimately moved from one region to another, as da Silva has, he may be penalized by the digital walls that sellers like Apple, Amazon are continuing to raise to close cross-region loopholes. (Amazon, Vudu and any other retailers of digital content have the same sort of contracts with the studios that Apple does.)\nIndeed, those movies may still be stored in da Silva's Australian account -- but he can't easily switch back to the Australian region to download them again.\nWhen we asked him to try, he sent us this photo:\nAnders G. da Silva\nApple generally requires customers to have a local credit card or PayPal account on file, which generally means he'd need a local billing address too. Since he now lives in Canada, not Australia, that's a little difficult -- though da Silva says Apple Support is promising to send him a workaround.\nBut even the workaround isn't particularly user-friendly. To get back into the Australian store, da Silva will have to forfeit his Canadian store subscriptions and store credits, he says. (Apple's support page suggests the same.) And if he wants to go back to the Canadian store, he'll need to download them to a Mac or iOS device, and use them as a local server, in order to stream them to his Apple TV.\nWhat we still don't know\nThe reason da Silva's missing movies got so much attention: they seemingly revealed Apple wouldn't stand by its customers if the studios tried to pull their films. We now know it's premature to say anything like that.\nTo be clear, the ability to buy or rent movies on services like iTunes and Amazon already fluctuates according to studio \"windowing\" calendars. But even if a movie you could buy on iTunes becomes unavailable to purchase for a few weeks -- or months -- it remains accessible in the cloud to those customers who bought it when it was being sold.\nAt least, that's how it's worked so far. We can't be sure what will will happen if Disney -- or any other content provider -- \"recalls\" a digital purchase, as a publisher did with an ebook of George Orwell's 1984 on Amazon back in 2009. It sounds like your \"already downloaded\" movies are safe, but what about cloud-based movies you've only ever streamed? Apple doesn't say.\nWe may have to cross that bridge when we come to it. As for da Silva, he now admits that his situation was a bit of an edge case:\n\"I fell into a licensing crack, it seems.\"\nWatch this: How to buy a media streamer in 2018 02:54\nHow to update your iPhone to iOS 12: You've got two options.\nA 5G iPhone?

        "title": "Report says AirPower mat faced overheating and coil interference problems, AirPower name may be used for significantly different product",
        "body": "Apple infamously unveiled AirPower alongside the iPhone X and Apple Watch Series 3 in September 2017 with a vague \u20182018\u2019 availability promise. In June, the product was still nowhere to be seen and Bloomberg reported on the major issues delaying the AirPower release, saying that the project had been pushed back to fall. With the September 2018 event now over, and even fewer mentions of AirPower on the Apple website, the prospects of the product being released in the last few months of 2018 are certainly bleak.\nSonny Dickson has published a report, citing Apple sources, that details three separate classes of problems that the company faced in bringing AirPower to market \u2026\nDickson\u2019s article echoes the overheating rumors that have been flying around. It says the mat produces far too much heat, which affects the charging rates of the devices laid on it. In addition, the heat is overloading the onboard silicon, a custom Apple charging chip that runs a stripped down version of iOS.\nThe report also says that the device communication software is also buggy. Data transfer about charging activation and charge levels is apparently buggy. Part of the appeal of AirPower is the flashy animated iPhone lock screen that reports the battery status of each device on the mat, so communication issues represent a significant issue.\nThe promise of AirPower is that there is no \u2018sweet spot\u2019, and you can charge up to three devices at a time. This is something that no other Qi charging mat on the market offers. Dickson says beneath the white surface of the charging mats sits between 21 and 24 different power coils of various sizes. This is the mechanism which enables a user to place a phone, watch or AirPods, on the mat in any location.\nHowever, the article notes that the tightly packed nature of this arrangement has led to interference issues between coils, reducing charging efficiency and causing excess heat. Dickson notes that the need for the coils to overlap is a particularly complex challenge. Several filed patents have shown glimpses of this internal structure before.\nThe Dickson report does not mention whether the project has been scrapped entirely. John Gruber has said that Apple has either gone back to the drawing board and started from scratch, or given up. Dickson suggests that Apple may use the AirPower trademark on a significantly different wireless charging product than what was originally envisioned and presented, perhaps due in Spring 2019 at the earliest.\nApple has so far refused to make comments to the press on the matter. We are impatiently awaiting a press release or some acknowledgement of the status of AirPower. Apple is widely expected to host an October event featuring new iPad Pros and MacBook updates, this is probably the last pole to cling on to if you are hoping for an AirPower launch before the end of the year. Apple promised a 2018 release, so technically it has three months left before it has to share the bad news.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "iOS 12 on the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPad Mini 2: It\u2019s actually faster!",
        "body": "When we tested iOS 11 on the iPhone 5S, it was clear that it was slower than iOS 10 had been but that the iPhone 5S\u2019 hardware was fast enough to keep everything usable. That\u2019s especially true if you tempered your expectations: the phone was going on four years old at the time.\nBut at the time, some of you asked us to test a handful of other older iOS devices, particularly the A7-equipped iPad Air and Mini 2 and the A8-equipped iPhone 6 Plus. In the iPads, the same A7 CPU and GPU that powers the iPhone 5S\u2019 screen has to adequately support a tablet with more than three times as many pixels. And the A8 in the 6 Plus draws a 2208\u00d71242 image which is then downscaled to the phone\u2019s 1080p screen; that means using a CPU that was around 25 percent faster than the A7 and a GPU that was only 50 percent faster to support a phone with 277 percent as many pixels.\nThe upshot is that those devices can often feel sluggish or laggy compared to subsequent models. Later Apple chips\u2014from the A8X in the iPad Air 2 and the A9 in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus onward, approximately\u2014remain more than fast enough to run iOS 11 without any huge degradation of performance. But with iOS 12 this year, we\u2019re testing an iPad Mini 2 and iPhone 6 Plus in addition to the old 5S to get an idea of how well Apple was able to improve the responsiveness of these older devices, many of which are still in use as secondary phones and tablets or hand-me-downs (or by people who just see no particular reason to upgrade).\nEach device was signed into a test iCloud account and allowed to fully sync mail, bookmarks, notes, and other data before being tested, and every device has a gently used battery that should be unaffected by battery-related slowdowns. In the case of the iPhone 5S, we also have data from last year\u2019s iOS-10-to-iOS-11 comparison\u2014we\u2019re using exactly the same 16GB iPhone to test iOS 12, which means we don\u2019t need to worry about the normal differences between units (like total storage capacity or NAND chips from different manufacturers or manufacturing runs). If trying this at home, your absolute test results may differ slightly from ours, but your relative results should be similar.\nAdvertisement\nApp launch times: iPhone 5S\nApplication iOS 10.3.3 iOS 11.0 iOS 11.4.1 iOS 12.0 GM Difference (%) Safari 1.2 seconds 1.5 seconds 1.44 seconds 1.15 seconds -20.6% Camera 0.9 seconds 0.9 seconds 0.97 seconds 0.81 seconds -16.2% Settings 0.9 seconds 1.3 seconds 1.16 seconds 0.86 seconds -26.1% Mail 1.4 seconds 1.8 seconds 1.67 seconds 1.36 seconds -18.5% Messages 0.8 seconds 1.1 seconds 1.03 seconds 0.89 seconds -14.2% Calendar 0.8 seconds 1.2 seconds 0.94 seconds 0.85 seconds -9.6% Maps 2.2 seconds 3.2 seconds 2.60 seconds 2.32 seconds -10.7% Notes 1.5 seconds 2.0 seconds 1.89 seconds 1.59 seconds -15.9% Cold boot 26.6 seconds 38.6 seconds 27.67 seconds 25.28 seconds -8.7%\nNote: iOS 10.3.3 and iOS 11.0 data is rounded to the nearest tenth of a second.\nAs usual, our first tests compare app launch times. App launch times aren\u2019t necessarily indicative of how a phone will feel to use once the apps are launched, but small increases or decreases in app launch time can have a large performance impact over time. We launched Safari, Camera, Settings, Mail, Messages, Calendar, Maps, and Notes, force-quitting the apps in between launches. The times below represent the average of three launches, which were tracked with a stopwatch. We also tested the boot time of each device.\nJumping from iOS 10.3.3 to iOS 11.0 resulted in a handful of small performance regressions that are marginally improved in iOS 11.4.1, but for the most part iOS 11\u2019s performance has stayed level. By comparison, across the board, iOS 12 performs almost as well as iOS 10, whether you\u2019re launching a lighter app like Settings, a heavier one like Maps, or cold booting your phone. It\u2019s an impressive, noticeable gain and a huge improvement for anyone out there who\u2019s still getting by with a 5S.\niPhone 6 Plus\nApplication iOS 11.4.1 iOS 12.0 GM Difference (%) Safari 1.23 seconds 1.02 seconds -17.3% Camera 1.0 seconds 0.82 seconds -18.3% Settings 0.95 seconds 0.75 seconds -21.7% Mail 1.27 seconds 1.14 seconds -10.5% Messages 0.79 seconds 0.73 seconds -7.2% Calendar 0.76 seconds 0.67 seconds -11.9% Maps 2.25 seconds 1.88 seconds -16.3% Notes 1.39 seconds 1.18 seconds -15.1% Cold boot 25.49 seconds 22.18 seconds -13.0%\nWe don\u2019t have data from iOS 10 for the iPhone 6 Plus, but measuring app launch times shows pretty much the same improvements that we saw on the iPhone 5S (and the 6 Plus was already as fast running iOS 11 as the iPhone 5S is after iOS 12\u2019s improvements). The percentage improvements are usually in the 10 to 15 percent range, with a handful of outliers in either direction.\niPad Mini 2\nApplication iOS 11.4.1 iOS 12.0 GM Difference (%) Safari 1.78 seconds 1.62 seconds -9.0% Camera 1.04 seconds 0.96 seconds -7.1% Settings 1.46 seconds 1.26 seconds -13.5% Mail 2.24 seconds 2.08 seconds -7.4% Messages 1.13 seconds 1.02 seconds -9.2% Calendar 1.14 seconds 0.93 seconds -18.5% Maps 3.54 seconds 2.61 seconds -26.2% Notes 2.54 seconds 2.32 seconds -8.7% Cold boot 27.31 seconds 23.34 seconds -14.5%\nThe iPad Mini 2\u2019s struggles are apparent in both iOS 11 and iOS 12. The iPad is slower across the board, and though it does benefit from iOS 12, the improvements are a bit smaller than they are for either phone.\nKeyboard display speed\u2014no difference we can see\nWe also tried to test Apple's claims of a faster keyboard display, which the company says is up to 50 percent faster in iOS 12 (based on comparing a beta build of iOS 11.4 to a beta build of iOS 12.0 on an iPhone 6 Plus). Using another iPhone, we shot a 240FPS slow-mo video to measure how long it took for the keyboard to spring up after tapping the screen. However, though we tested all three of our test devices in both Notes and Safari, we weren't able to detect a measurable difference in keyboard load time between iOS 11.4.1 and the GM build of iOS 12.\nAdvertisement\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that Apple is misrepresenting iOS 12's performance; we aren't privy to the exact conditions Apple tested under, and faster app load times ultimately mean faster keyboard loads anyway. But if you were hoping that iOS 12 might solve keyboard lag while bringing the keyboard up or while typing on it, it doesn't look like much has changed since iOS 11.\nAn argument against forced obsolescence\nI\u2019ve been testing iOS on old devices for six years, and I\u2019ve never seen a release that has actually improved performance on old devices. At best, updates like iOS 6, iOS 9, and iOS 10 didn\u2019t make things much worse; at worst, updates like iOS 7 and iOS 8 made old devices feel like old devices. Anyone using an older device can safely upgrade to iOS 12 without worrying about speed, and that\u2019s a big deal. You\u2019ll notice an improvement most of the time, even on newer devices (my iPad Air 2, which had started to feel its age running iOS 11, feels great with iOS 12).\nAgain, it\u2019s not all rosy. We didn't notice any improvements in keyboard display times. You may still run into trouble running newer games, since there's no software update that can transform an old GPU into a new one. And the iPad Air and Mini 2, in particular, are going to continue feeling kind of slow in general\u2014an iPhone-class processor and 1GB of RAM are just not enough power to keep a high-resolution tablet feeling snappy for five years. With devices as old as these, the condition of the battery can significantly affect performance, too. If you\u2019ve never replaced your battery (or if it has been more than two or three years since you did it last), make an appointment with the Genius Bar before those $29 battery replacements go away at the end of 2018.\nBut if nothing else, iOS 12 is a convincing counterargument to the theory that Apple intentionally hobbles its old devices to force people to buy new ones. In addition to running more like iOS 10 did, it supports devices going all the way back to 2013, which sets a new record for iOS\u2019 software support window. Given their age, these phones and tablets feel reasonably good in everyday real-world use, including browsing, emailing, and using most apps.",

        "title": "Apple Filed Patents for Larger Apple Watch Displays with Smooth Edges and an OLED Display Burn-In Solution",
        "body": "On Thursday the US Patent & Trademark Office published two patent applications from Apple relating to larger Apple Watch interfaces that appear smoother on curved edges and an anti-burn-in solution for OLED displays.\nPixel Array Antialiasing to Accommodate Curved Display Edges\nApple notes in this patent application that a display may have one or more curved edges. For example, the display may have curved edges associated with rounded corners in the housing. The display may have an array of pixels with jagged edges along the curved edges.\nThe display may include full-strength pixels and may have a band of antialiasing pixels having selectively reduced strengths relative to the full-strength pixels. The antialiasing pixels may be provided with a pattern of strengths that visually smooth content displayed along the curved edges.\nThe pixels may be organic light-emitting diode pixels, liquid crystal display pixels, or other display pixels. Organic light-emitting diode pixels may have drive transistors and associated organic light-emitting diodes. The strength of the antialiasing pixels may be selectively reduced by modifying drive transistor geometry, adding series resistances, or by forming opaque light blocking structures that selectively limit the amount of light emitted by the organic light-emitting diodes. Liquid crystal display pixels may include electrodes of different shapes and/or opaque layer openings of different sizes to form antialiasing pixels with reduced strengths.\nAccording to Apple, \"hardware-based antialiasing techniques may be used to smooth the appearance of images along the curved edges of display 14 in FIG. 3 below.\nIn particular, the strengths of pixels along the curved edges may be arranged in an antialiasing pattern that visually smooths content that is displayed on the display along the curved edge and reduces undesired jagged image artifacts.\nApple's patent FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an illustrative electronic device (Apple Watch); FIG. 3 is a diagram of an illustrative curved edge of a pixel array in a display.\nApple's patent application may, in the end, be coming to market in Apple Watch Series 4 if 9to5Mac's posted photo on Thursday actually launches in September.\nHall had noted that \"The biggest change is the all-new edge-to-edge display. Apple has been rumored to be working on ~15% bigger displays for both sizes of Apple Watch.\" Hall added that it appears that \"Apple has achieved this by dramatically reducing the bezel size around the watch display.\"\nLike all patents, Apple doesn't restrict their invention to the Apple Watch, which is shown to be the preferred device in this invention. Apple notes that it could apply to any iDevice, a device embedded in eyeglasses, a head mounted display, a display in a vehicle and more.\nApple's patent application 20180246363 titled \"Pixel Array Antialiasing to Accommodate Curved Display Edges,\" was filed back in Q2 2018. Parts of this invention dates back to at least 2016.\nIt should also be noted that Apple was granted a patent in April 2018 covering both round and curved display advancements for a future Apple Watch interface.\nConsidering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.\nCompression Techniques for Burn-In on OLED Displays\nApple notes in their patent filing that new compression challenges are arising as computing device capabilities are improved through hardware and software advancements. For example, organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays--which are becoming a popular choice for computing device displays--can degrade in a non-uniform manner over their lifespans and lead to unwanted color/brightness artifacts.\nTo address this concern, burn-in statistics--which record historical usage information associated with a given OLED display--can be used to artificially adjust the operation of the OLED display to substantially restore visual uniformity throughout its operation.\nIt is also desirable to store the burn-in statistics in a more efficient manner.\nApple's invention covers techniques for compressing high-resolution, multiple-channel images that store burn-in statistics for display devices. In particular, the techniques involve pre-processing the images (i.e., prior to compression) in a manner that can enhance resulting compression ratios when the images are compressed using lossless compressors.\nAfter a plurality of pixels are quantized, the method involves performing a series of operations against each modified pixel of the plurality of modified pixels.\nIn particular, a first operation involves applying an invertible transformation to the at least two sub-pixel values for the modified pixel to produce an equal number of transformed sub-pixel values.\nA second operation involves applying a predictive coding to at least one of the transformed sub-pixel values of the modified pixel, where applying the predictive coding involves establishing a differential value by subtracting a corresponding and previously-processed sub-pixel value from the at least one of the transformed sub-pixel values.\nA third operation involves encoding the differential value into two corresponding bytes, and encoding each of the other transformed sub-pixel values (different from the at least one of the transformed sub-pixel values) into respective two corresponding bytes.\nA fourth operation involves serially storing the corresponding bytes as a data stream into a buffer.\nFinally, a fifth operation involves compressing the data stream in the buffer, where the outputs of the compressed data streams for each of the modified pixels are continuously joined together to produce a compressed image.\nApple's patent FIG. 1 illustrates an overview / flowchart of a computing device that can be configured to perform various techniques as it relates to the current invention to safeguard against OLED display burn-in.\nApple makes reference in their filing that their invention relates to OLED displays for iPhones, iPads and Apple Watch.\nApple's patent application 20180247589 was filed in August 2017 and published this week by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\nPatently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications and/or granted patents with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

        "body": "Update: A previous version of this article described the L-shaped battery as \u2018single-cell\u2019. This is incorrect. The story has been corrected.\nWith iPhone XS and Apple Watch Series 4 officially launching on Friday, expect a wave of teardowns, drop tests, speed tests and such over the next few days. The first complete teardown we\u2019ve seen is by FixjeiPhone.\nThey managed to get their hands on a 5.8-inch iPhone XS ahead of time, which lets us see how the internal design has advanced since the iPhone X.\nUnfortunately, the video is narrated in Dutch but you can follow along with English captions.\nThe technician disassembling the device noted that separating the display from the chassis is harder now that Apple has added more dust and waterproofing seals. Apple iPhone XS touts IP68 water resistance, which means it is rated to survive 30 minutes submerged in 2 meters of fresh water.\nThe main difference we can see is a new battery component. With iPhone X, Apple started using L-shaped batteries. However, the iPhone X was really two separate battery cells in a L-shaped layout \u2014 there was a clear crease in the component where the batteries were joined up. With iPhone XS, Apple is now using a two-cell L-shaped battery design, with everything contained in a single package. It now looks like a single part.\nIn terms of battery capacity, iPhone XS battery is 2658 mAH. This is actually slightly lower than the iPhone X\u2019s 2716 mAH battery. Nevertheless, Apple says the iPhone XS battery life in use is better than its predecessor, lasting up to 30 minutes longer with typical usage. This is presumably because the new A12 chip is more power-efficient thanks to its 7 nanometer process.\nWatch the full teardown here:",

But now the Treo 650 and the Sony 910 have shown hardware layouts that work well. The software however is still a mess.\nIf Apple came up with the iPhone, it would be a great inducer into the G5. An executive with a smartphone has to sync well. The elegant sync between the iPhone and the bosses' G5 would be the beginning of a tidal wave of conversions away from the PCs.\nSmartphone executives have the money. The influence. And it takes very little for the boss to throw away all the PCs and replace them with MACs. But the MIS nerd would never do that on his own. It takes the boss to issue the want. And believe me, that boss holds his phone as his most important tool. To see seamless sync between his iPhone and his G5 would be too seductive to ignore.\nTo put it another way: If Apple has enjoyed the bonanza of iPods and Minis generating converts, imagine how leading from the top with the iPhone will do the job. iPod and Mini buyers are the young executives. iPhone buyers are also the top executives, a market that Apple could leverage greatly into its largest conversions away from clunky PCs into MACs.\nThis is an important opportunity for Apple. And the window is a good three years. Right now Windows phones are stuck in a dead end with bugs, crashes and an operating system that needs to be purged. But their ego and inertia won't let them backpedal.\nBrushedTooth\nRemember To Shop Smart Shop S Mart\njoin:2001-02-12\nWesterville, OH BrushedTooth Member Although I love my Powerbook and Mac's and would love to see Apple develop an OS for phones, Microsoft's Smartphone 2003 SE is a very good OS for a phone, one of the few things I feel they have gotten right. I had an Audiovox SMT 5600 and now an Motorola MPX220 and they are great phones.\nosme\nPremium Member\njoin:2001-09-07\nBrantford osme to Cortland\nPremium Member to Cortland\nSo you're saying that companies should throw away their PCs, get Macs and all the compatibility issues that will come with switching (a lot of companies would have their own programs written, which would not be multiplatform), not to mention the comparatively astronomical prices of Macs, just for a nifty little phone? Right.\nstonhinge\nPremium Member\njoin:2003-07-28\nTopeka, KS stonhinge Premium Member Ah, but it's only a higher initial price, over the long term, the Macs would actually be cheaper, especially when one factors in tech support costs, which in general are lower for Macs than Windows machines.\nCortland\nPremium Member\njoin:2002-08-24\nMiami, FL Cortland to osme\nPremium Member to osme\nLook at it this way. Say Donald Trump got the iPhone. He would then get a Mac. Then his whole organization would get MACs. It is leading from the top.\nThe iPod is not used by Donald Trump. It may be used by his young assistants with no power.\nYou can bet Donald is in his Limo saying \"darn, what's the name of that guy?\" You can bet when he is alone he is on the phone.\nApple enamoured the young with the iPod, now it can enamour the decision makers with the phone.\nThe only person who can influence the MIS manager is the President. Get the president his toy and you get a lot back.\nMacThrasher\nPremium Member\njoin:2002-04-26\nChagrin Falls, OH MacThrasher to Cortland\nPremium Member to Cortland\nI think the phone market is well saturated enough that the iPhone would not be much money for Apple. Let the Motorolas', Nokias', and LG's beat it out. With Bluetooth, my Motorola and PowerBook communicate just fine. Most phone companied are throwing in the phone when you place a two or three year contract.\nrjackal\nPremium Member\njoin:2002-07-09\nPlymouth, MI rjackal to Cortland\nPremium Member to Cortland\nsaid by Cortland:\nLook at it this way.

Then his whole organization would get MACs.\nThe president and MIS manager are also under the gun to cut costs, and a paradigm shift in computing, throwing out all your existing PC-only software, is not a good way to do that. I think the leap between the exec getting the Mac and the whole company getting Macs is flawed. Have you worked in a company? The boss' computer usually bears little resemblance to the 'real' computers in a company. For example, my 3 bosses have little Sony Vaio laptops, thin and light. They travel a lot, and all they need to do is run Excel and read email. In the rest of engineering, we use Dell mid-towers with 21\" CRT displays.The president and MIS manager are also under the gun to cut costs, and a paradigm shift in computing, throwing out all your existing PC-only software, is not a good way to do that.\nThe Dv8or\nJust call me Dong Suck Oh, M.D.\nPremium Member\njoin:2001-08-09\nDenver, CO ARRIS TG862\nCisco 2811\nTP-Link Archer AX10\nThe Dv8or to Cortland\nPremium Member to Cortland\nMgauss must not work in a corporate environment. High level managers typically HATE any kind of change. You wouldn't believe the hurdles I have to jump through so I can install Acrobat Reader 7 on my CEO's and COO's computer. God forbid there is any kind of UI or workflow change, even if a click button is moved a half inch to the left on the newest version of whatever, the senior admin asst has a shitfit. This is not uncommon throughout corporate environments.\nNot a chance my boss is about to toss his laptop and learn how to use a Mac.\niDonDon\njoin:2001-12-21\nFort Lauderdale, FL iDonDon Member So true, if you change the color of their desktop you have to train.\nCortland\nPremium Member\njoin:2002-08-24\nMiami, FL Cortland Premium Member mgauss works on top management. You guys are middle.\nTop management has the power to change the eternally anal attitude of the MIS manager or VP. It requires a \"paradigm shift.\" That is something MIS managers get from top management.\nBut OK let's ignore that pearl. Where is the iPod going? Phones now have 2 gig memory cards that cost under $ 100. Phones are playing MP3's. In a year there will be SD cards with 6 and 20 Gigs!\nSoon even the densest will acknowledge that carrying a phone and an iPod won't make sense.\nSo again, Apple has the opportunity to make the \"hot product one always carries with one\" -- the multifunction color screen/storage/phone/backup/mp3/movies/speakerphone/calculator/email/web browser micro safari/come on you'd buy it in a second...\nGod\nTHE Dslr Troll\nPremium Member\njoin:2002-07-01\nColorado Springs, CO God Premium Member i dont think that it would be a smart idea for apple to get into this market area, as much as i like what apple has done with the whole music/ipod segment, there is way to much competition in the phone market. As was mentioned before, let the motorolas and ericsons of the world beat each other up. If you combine everything into one little package you make a confusing mess. They have failed before in the PDA segment, Ahem newton, and i dont think that they would do the same ever again.\nCortland\nPremium Member\njoin:2002-08-24\nMiami, FL Cortland Premium Member To say that Apple failed in the all in one market is the same as expecting the .com boom to have worked on dial up.\nTechnology is now at the point where speed, storage and battery life are fantastic. What is now needed is precisely what Apple does best: streamlining, simplifying the complex, and making it work.\nSmart phones sell for $ 500. There is margin there. And also Apple can get a chunk of the monthly payment...selling programs itself.\nLook at the Treo 650 and at the Sony p910 in google.com\nThink of the earning power of the salespeople in the field who cannot lug a 5 pounder.\nNow Motorola or Sony can make it for Apple.\nCome on I'm I alone here?\nOr look at this equation\nWhat is iPod + (Mac Mini - drive) + iSuite?

As soon as the Ipod was windows compatible (and it syncs just as elegantly in windows as it does on a Mac...in fact my ipod actually has higher sustained transfer speeds via my desktops firewire then it does via my G4 Powerbooks...) it begun to sell in large amounts.\nWhat your expecting to happen is beyond me. A smartphone no matter how revolutionary is not going to cause a CEO of a company...especially a publically owned/traded company to scrap their whole PC infrastructure and start over.\nYou also state \"Say Donald Trump got the iPhone.

Of course the MIS manager cannot appreciate that. He needs top management to tell him: Bruce, we know it is expensive, but we think personal productivity will be higher with the Apples. They are simply a pleasure to use.I know you think some magical Linear Programming Optimization program runs high end decisions at a top management level. Watch the Apprentice. The higher the organization level, the more subjective decisions become. At that level the productivity of the employee is more important than the MIS budget.5 years ago a computer was $ 5000. Today it is $ 500. The hardware is not the issue now. The issue is easy of use, that \"fun\" component, all those subtle things that make us read this forum.If you were to ask a young person if they wanted a MAC or a PC for their first computer, 90% would pick a MAC. The thing is they get a PC from Best Buy.Yes, Apple has to overcome the inertia of the PC world. An iPod/iPhone combination would make the connection in people's minds. Of course the iPhone, like the iPod has to work in both platforms. But even a casual user would know in their gut where all that elegance/ease of use came from.You keep repeating if a company would change \"all their hardware\"...companies continuosly replace hardware, and I bet you the division that changes first to MAC will show productivity improvements.Yes, top management is subjective. Yes your tirade is an ad for Gates. And yes people look at the iPhone and the MAC of the boss.As the boss walks around the company he wonders why he has the MAC and his best men don't. Leadership secrets from Atila the Hun. Great book. All are looking at the boss and emulating.The Apple revolution is here. Steve Jobs knows it, he's fought all this way and never has he had it so close.\nI can afford a G5 easily, but why would I? What can a G5 do that my curent PC and G4 Powerbook can't? Nothing other then prohibit me from running some apps that I have that are PC only. What I meant when I said it was \"cost prohibitive\" for me to replace my PC with a Mac I wasn't saying that I could afford it, merely that the costs of me switching to one (which would be in excess of $6,000 dollars once I go out and rebuy all my software)...now what does that $6,000 bucks spent do for me? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It doesn't make my work go any faster, it doesn't save me time, it certainly doesn't save me money...so whats my incentive..because it's pretty? I can buy a pretty case for my PC for less then 6,000 if I so choose...\nOf course you can't tell us what company your with...because you choose not too. I don't know of a single company that prohibits employees from letting others know they work there, but anyway lets once again point out your flaws.\n\"But productivity is a much more important issue than hardware and software costs\"\nYes, but a MAC DOES NOT INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY!!!! What do you fail to understand about that? In fact with all the switching out of hardware, rewriting internal applications that are PC only, etc, etc you have actually DECREASED productivity.\nThe fact that you just said \"Watch the Apprentice. The higher the organization level, the more subjective decisions become. At that level the productivity of the employee is more important than the MIS budget.\" is beyond ridiculous.\nI have met and talked to both Mark Burnett and Donald Trump (Hence how I know they both use G4 17\" Powerbooks) In fact to satisfy your telling me to \"watch the apprentice\", I was there during one of the challenges being filmed, hence how I met Mr Trump and Mr Burnett.\nIf you think the apprentice is an accurate representation of how a company is run then I begin to highly doubt your salary and credentials.\n\"If you were to ask a young person if they wanted a MAC or a PC for their first computer, 90% would pick a MAC. The thing is they get a PC from Best Buy.\"\nWhat young people are you talking to? I live in the center of a college town of over 30,000 students and live adjacent to the campus, students walk by my door every day and you know what I see the majority of them carrying? Computer bags with the word \"DELL\" emblazoned right on the side. When I goto the coffeeshops around here some of which offer free WiFi access I RARELY see Mac's...all you see are PC's. This is not because the student's parents just blindly went out and bought them a PC, it's because the student WANTED a pc. You also don't take into the account that most young people like to play games on their computer, that IMMEDIATELY rules out a Mac. Mac's are not for gamers, this is known world round, it's an indisputable fact that the large majority of games DO NOT run on Mac.\nAlso to cover some bases in case you bring up the end user/company installing a program such as Virtual PC to access their PC only applications...Well not only did you just lower productivity due to having to open another interface, wait for the guest OS to load etc etc, but you also greatly sacrificed system stability that supposedly made you switch to Mac in the first place.\nI'd love to know where your pulled the 90% figure from since all that shows is that you have an insane love of Mac and you think young kids share the same.\n\"Yes, Apple has to overcome the inertia of the PC world.

In fact Trump had other people with him who were also carrying laptops...not one of them was a Mac. Tell me, why did Trump not immediately go out and buy them Macs? Oh thats right THERE IS NO FRIGGIN REASON FOR HIM TO SWITCH THEM!!!!!!\nYou have yet to name ONE way in which a department full of Mac's will show any increased productivity versus a department of PC's. Don't try and bring up \"less crashes, less maintenance\" because that is completely subjective and Mac's crash just like a PC does.\nAlso in a corporate environment PC's are maintained by staff, they usually all have the same programs on them, employees aren't constantly installing/uninstalling programs/drivers/etc therefore the majority of reasons for a crash are greatly reduced.\nEveryone has given you very VALID reasons why a company won't up and switch to Mac, but you have yet to give ONE VALID reason why a company would.\nMac's are becoming nicer/smaller and more people want them for this reason, but lets not kid ourselves into believing there is any sort of revolution on the way cause there is not and there never will be a mass migration to Mac.\nAlso the cheapest mac currently available...the Mac Mini...is actually MORE expensive then alot of smaller PC's and doesn't run as fast with it's stock config. The fact that Apple includes only 256MB of ram in all thier stock mini configs shows that they are intentionally forcing users to upgrade to their insanely inflated ram prices (Explain to me why Apple attempts to charge me 200+ dollars for ram that I can buy for 60 bucks elsewhere and that works exactly the same?)

I realize that \"upper management\" doesn't care. So be it. I can also say the just because \"upper management\" has a new and nifty toy, uses it, and perhaps even has a productivity increase, that there will suddenly be a paradigm shift in the way IT within an organization does business.\nBut to think that your position, income, etc. makes \"lower\" employees slavishly want to follow your every stylistic whim is silly at best, if not just plain pompous. You claim to have a position of great authority and responsibility yet you come off as having the subtlety and nuance of a hyperactive third-grader armed with a megaphone and a (small) sledgehammer. Your position is high and mighty, but your attitude about it should not be. Learn humility. Listening is a gooood thing.\nPersonally, I'm just a grunt and even I know the type of revolutions you imply that iPhones would create do not take place in companies, or at least within companies that will maintain any hope of long-term viability.\nAs has already been eloquently said by others in this thread, yes there is top-down management, but it's never instantaneous, and doesn't happen in the monkey see-monkey do way you indicate. Furthermore, any IT manager / VP / executive worth his salt isn't going to be bullied by some guy with a slightly better parking space and a shinier Porsche because of a phone. PUH-LEASE. If anything, the responsible manager will take it under consideration, do due diligence, and provide a cost/benefit analysis, which would show the obvious: changing the enterprise due to a gadget is not worth it.\nAnd any person, like yourself, in \"upper management\" would hope that their IT folks had the good sense to do this. But like I said, I'm just a lowly low-paid grunt, so what do I know? I'm happy that you make more than ten times what I do. Congratulations. You should be very very proud that you are able to do so much with so little actual knowledge of how things really work.\nHeck, if doing what the CEO did was what everyone in the corporation should do, then there would be a LOT more private jets in the air. A lot more stretched Mercedes-Benzes, too.\nNow, if you were talking about a slow progression toward Macs because Apple offered a superior product (we know they do) AND there was the type of software available that businesses needed (there likely is) AND users would adapt to the change instantly (not bloody likely) AND corporate IT departments changed courses like the breeze (think glacier) THEN and ONLY THEN I might agree with you. Somewhat.\nThere's not a single product in the universe, much less a phone, that can be the catalyst for that much change. Probably a good idea.
