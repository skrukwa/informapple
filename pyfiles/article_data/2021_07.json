        "body": "With iOS 14.5 released to the public earlier this year, iPhone and iPad users now have the ability to easily opt out of cross-site and cross-app tracking and targeting. New data from analytics firm Branch indicates that just 25% of users are opting in to tracking, which is causing panic in the advertising industry.\nAs detailed in a new report from Bloomberg, the impact is being felt in particular by Facebook advertisers. Facebook is reportedly no longer able to provide certain metrics to advertisers to help them know whether their ads are working:\nFacebook advertisers, in particular, have noticed an impact in the last month. Media buyers who run Facebook ad campaigns on behalf of clients said Facebook is no longer able to reliably see how many sales its clients are making, so it\u2019s harder to figure out which Facebook ads are working. Losing this data also impacts Facebook\u2019s ability to show a business\u2019s products to potential new customers. It also makes it more difficult to \u201cre-target\u201d people with ads that show users items they have looked at online, but may not have purchased.\nWhile Facebook declined to respond to Bloomberg\u2019s report, data from Branch shows that roughly 75% of iPhone users are now running iOS 14.5 or later with App Tracking transparency and that just 25% of those users have tapped on \u201cAllow\u201d when they see the prompt.\nFacebook says that it is working on new features to help make up for the data lost due to App Tracking Transparency, including \u201cnew advertising features that require less data to measure an ad\u2019s success.\u201d The company is also reportedly exploring ways to deliver ads based on data stored on the user\u2019s device.\n\u201cApple\u2019s policy is hurting the ability of businesses to use their advertising budgets efficiently and effectively, and the limitations being created are driven by Apple\u2019s restrictions for their own benefit,\u201d the spokesman added, noting that Facebook has tried to prep advertisers with notices, blogs and webinars. \u201cWe believe that personalized ads and user privacy can coexist.\u201d\nThe full report at Bloomberg is well worth a read and provides more details from some of the advertisers affected by the changes.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "Apple AirPod batteries are almost impossible to replace, showing the need for right-to-repair reform",
        "body": "In this article AAPL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nSecond-generation Apple AirPods with wireless charging indicator Todd Haselton | CNBC\nWhen AirPods were first released in 2016, they were a marvel of miniaturization. To ditch cords and go wireless, Apple packed several chips, microphones and speakers into each headphone, which weigh about 4 grams. Without a cord, the earbud gets its power from a tiny cylindrical battery that has about 1% of the capacity of an iPhone's battery. But lithium-ion batteries, like those used by the AirPods, wear out the more they are used. Some owners have noticed that, after a few years, used AirPods eventually will last only an hour or so before needing to be recharged -- a big decay from the four-to-five-hour battery life they have when new. Because each AirPod is so small and so tightly packed into its housing, it's almost impossible to swap out the old battery for a new one. Most people give up and just buy a new pair. The limited lifespan of AirPods is exactly the kind of problem that the \"right-to-repair\" movement wants to fix. Repair shops and lobbyists that support repair reform want lawmakers to implement a variety of rules, including increased access to manuals and official parts and consumer protections around warranties. But one of their most important requests is for companies to design products with repair in mind, instead of packing gadgets with unlabeled parts and sticking them together with glue, forcing users to use a knife to take them apart. This desire puts repair advocates at odds with hardware companies like Apple, whose business models depend on customers upgrading to the latest model every few years. When Apple offered cheap iPhone battery repairs a few years ago, it hurt sales as consumers were able to hang on to their old phones for longer instead of upgrading. Apple also charges customers for repairs and extended warranties. \"We design our products for durability in order to minimize the need for repair,\" Apple wrote in an environmental report earlier this year. \"But in the instance a repair is needed, we believe our customers should have convenient access to safe and reliable repair services, to get their product back up and running as quickly as possible.\"\nThe right-to-repair movement gains steam\nPolicymakers have started to engage more closely with right-to-repair advocates in recent years. State-level bills have been introduced in a majority of states, but electronics companies have lobbied against them and none have passed. In May, the Federal Trade Commission released a 56-page report on repair restrictions, concluding that repair restrictions have \"steered consumers into manufacturers' repair networks or to replace products before the end of their useful lives\" \u2014 exactly the problem users are running into with their AirPods. The Biden administration on Friday ordered the FTC to write new regulations targeted at limiting manufacturers' ability to hamper independent or do-it-yourself repairs as part of a sweeping executive order. New repair rules have not yet been drafted. \"Tech and other companies impose restrictions on self and third-party repairs, making repairs more costly and time-consuming, such as by restricting the distribution of parts, diagnostics, and repair tools,\" the White House wrote in a fact sheet about the order on Friday, linking to a story about fixing Apple products. Apple declined to comment on the White House executive order. The FTC has not said what it plans to do, but repair advocates want a few key policy changes, as detailed in its May report. They want companies to be required to make official replacement parts available. They want access to tools that could make repairs easier without reverse-engineering the tools or parts themselves. And ultimately, they want products to be designed with longer lifespans. Apple is not the only company that would be affected by these policies. Much of the recent pressure is on medical device companies and tractor manufacturers. But given Apple's ubiquity, it has become a poster child for repair, especially because it promotes its environmental efforts as a corporate value. Apple has launched a program it calls the \"Independent Repair Program\" which gives repair shops the option to enter into a certification process and contract with Apple in order to get access to authentic Apple parts, tools and manuals. Apple has also reduced the price of its battery replacement for iPhones, and recent models have been designed to make it easier to replace a battery or cracked screen, according to iFixit. Plus, compared to other consumer electronics companies, Apple has a large existing network of stores and authorized repair shops. Still, many Apple products remain challenging to repair at home or as a business with no contact with Apple.\nThe only AirPods battery replacement company\niFixit, a company that provides disassembly instructions and sells replacement parts for gadgets, gives AirPods models a score of zero out of 10 for repairability. According to iFixit, repairing these earbuds involves soldering, hot air guns and slicing through glue \u2014 that is, if replacement battery parts are even available. In the end, a would-be home repairer would have to put the four-gram computer back together again. Apple provides \"battery service\" for AirPods, at the cost of $49 per earbud. But functionally, Apple simply gives you a replacement pair, and the old earbuds are recycled. It's not a repair, it's a replacement. And it's expensive. AirPods originally cost $159, so opting for battery service costs more than half of the price of a new pair. Apple sold about 72.8 million AirPods units in 2020, according to a CounterPoint research estimate, so tens of millions of consumers will face the same lack of choice in the coming years.\nReplacement AirPods from PodSwap CNBC\nPodSwap is a Miami company founded by Emma Stritzinger and Emily Alpert which aims to keep AirPods \"out of the landfill.\" They're not associated with Apple. They believe they're the only company performing AirPod battery replacements, although other companies \"refurbish\" old AirPods, the founders told CNBC. The company was formed after the founders experienced dying AirPods themselves and thought that upgrading or replacing them would be wasteful and impractical. I recently replaced a pair of AirPods that were only holding a charge for 45 minutes -- too short to complete a phone call. I paid $59 on PodSwap's Shopify site and a few days later received a replacement pair of AirPods with new batteries. They weren't my old AirPods, they were another set that had their batteries replaced. Along with those new pods, PodSwap includes a box and a return label. It wants your old AirPods back. It then cleans and sanitizes the old pair, puts in new batteries and sends them out to the next person who wants to change the battery in their old AirPods. But PodSwap faces many challenges that show why repair advocates want new rules. Alpert said the design of the AirPod makes it challenging for repair shops or companies like theirs to do a lot of battery replacements. PodSwap's process uses both robotics and manual labor, the founders said. \"The process was developed through trial and error and a large number of units were 'sacrificed' and ultimately recycled. One major challenge we faced was overcoming the uniqueness of this product. Each AirPod is assembled with slight differences, which creates complexity in the disassembly,\" Alpert said.\nPodSwap includes a box to send old AirPods back. CNBC",

However, not everyone seems willing to return to the office, and now some employees are saying they will leave the company as it is denying requests for remote work.\nIn a new report from The Verge, it was revealed that Apple has been denying even more requests from employees who want to continue working from home instead of the new hybrid model. In a Slack channel with 6,000 members, employees argue that they will leave Apple if the company doesn\u2019t change its decision.\nWhile Apple historically discouraged employees from working from home, there were one-off exceptions to the rule, and some teams were more lenient than others. Now, employees say that even those exceptions are being denied. In a company Slack channel where employees advocate for remote work, roughly 10 people said they were resigning due to the hybrid work policy or knew others who\u2019d been forced to quit.\nSome employees who are \u201ccurrently on an Americans with Disabilities Act accommodation\u201d can work from home. However, if Apple decides to return to the office permanently, the accommodation will be denied. The company gives employees 30 days to find a new job if it denies medical accommodation.\nThe Verge was told that the company has been asking for medical records to decide if employees will be approved to work from home which, according to them, \u201cmade some people uncomfortable.\u201d\nLast month, an internal survey organized by Apple employees showed that at least 90% of employees want flexibility when it comes to working remotely, but the company argues that working in person is essential and expects everyone to be back in the office soon. Employees even sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook asking for changes, but these requests were all denied.\nApple declined to comment on the report.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

First, TG spoke to Tim Millet, VP of platform architecture at Apple who said the priority with Apple silicon was to make the best chip on the market:\n\"If somebody else could build a chip that was actually going to deliver better performance inside that enclosure, what's the point? Why would we switch?,\" said Tim Millet, Vice President of platform architecture at Apple.\" \"And so for my chip architects, that was the target.\"\nMillet noted how Apple started work on Rosetta years before Apple silicon to make sure that the transition to Apple silicon would be seamless, and that \"everything worked out the box as expected\", he also spoke of the pride of Apple's graphics folks:\n\"Of course, you can imagine the pride of some of the GPU folks and imagining, 'Hey, wouldn't it be great if it hits a broader set of those really intense gamers,'\" said Millet. \"It's a natural place for us to be looking, to be working closely with our Metal team and our Developer team. We love the challenge.\"\nBut the really fantastic revelation from the piece came from Apple's VP of worldwide product marketing, Bob Borchers, who told TG that the first time his team saw the Apple's M1 chip in action, they assumed the battery indicator was broken due to a bug because it performed so well:\n\"When we saw that first system and then you sat there and played with it for a few hours and the battery didn't move, we thought 'Oh man, that's a bug, the battery indicator is broken,'\" said Bob Borchers, VP of worldwide product marketing for Apple.\nMillet was present and laughed them off stating \"nope, that's the way it's supposed to be\", Borchers said it was \"pretty phenomenal.\"\nApple's MacBook Air with M1 and 13-inch MacBook Pro with M1 deliver best-in-class battery life and performance thanks to the energy efficiency of the M1 chip, as well as pretty staggering power and performance.\nThe company is expected to debut a new M1X chip with 10-cores including 8 high-performance cores in a new set of MacBook Pro models later this year.",

        "title": "\"Your iPhone left behind\" feature coming to the Apple Watch",
        "body": "A feature has been uncovered in watchOS 8 Beta for those amongst us that are forgetful. Your Apple Watch has gained the ability to nag you if you leave your iPhone or iPad behind.\nIf you\u2019ve ever forgotten your smartphone at home, you know how annoying this can be. Even worse is forgetting your phone in a public place such as a restaurant. A new feature coming to the Apple Watch wants to make this a thing of the past.\nThe watchOS 8 Beta is currently circulating around. Announced in June it comes with useful new features such as respiratory info, new mindfulness tools, some additional workout types, along with a handful of other smaller upgrades.\nAnd while all of these features were talked about at the Apple\u2019s Developer Conference, there is one new one that wasn\u2019t mentioned. It\u2019s a very useful one.\n\u201cNotify When Left Behind\u201d\nThe Apple Watch on your wrist can detect if your iPhone is no longer detected near you. The feature has been around in Beta for Apple AirTags for a few versions, but now it works between iOS devices!\nThe Apple Watch telling you \u2013 \u201cHey, you forgot your phone!\u201d will be a godsend to some of us. Even if you\u2019ve never left your phone behind, there\u2019s always the chance you will.\nThe feature can be found in the Find My app. This needs to be run initially for the functionality to kick in.\nYou can locate the app via the Digital Crown on your Apple Watch. Run it and then simply choose the device, iPhone, iPad, etc. You\u2019ll notice an option \u201cNotify When Left Behind\u201d. This can be switched on or off. You may also need to switch on Location Services in the Settings section on your iPhone in order for everything to work properly.\nPresumably adding this type of functionality wasn\u2019t too much of a challenge. After all, the Apple Watch has always been aware if it is not close to your phone \u2013 as it needs this info to know when to switch from WiFi to cellular.\nAs mentioned AirTags functionality is part of the Beta, as well. For example, if you attach an AirTag to your car keys, the watch will ping you with a reminder if you\u2019ve left them behind.\nWhich means you get the best of both worlds. Both AirTags functionality ported over to the Apple Watch, plus the ability for reminders to work between individual iOS devices.\nEssential reading: Top fitness trackers and health gadgets\nThis is definitely useful functionality and we hope it makes it to the official release in September. Early reports are that it works well. If you want to try out the feature right now you will need to install watchOS 8 Beta.\nIt also works the other way around\nThe Apple Watch \u201cNotify When Left Behind\u201d feature is part of a wider rollout that works on the whole Apple ecosystem. The aim of this is to get devices communicating with each other seamlessly.\nThis means you can pick and choose from various combinations consisting of devices that can run iOS15, iPadOS 15 watchOS 8 and MacOS Monterey. Basically, this allows you to keep tabs on all devices connected to your Apple ID.\nSo for example, you can set it up to notify you on your iPhone if you\u2019ve left your Apple Watch behind. Or if you\u2019ve forgotten your iPad. If you want to track non-Apple devices you will need to attach an AirTag to the item to get these types of alerts.\nSetting up the \u201cNotify When Left Behind\u201d feature on the iPhone and iPad is similar to the procedure for the iPhone. Basically you need to:\nOpen the Find my app on the device, Then tap on the Devices tab along the bottom You\u2019ll get a list of all the devices connected to your Apple ID Choose one of them and scroll down in the menu until you see the \u201cNotify When Left Behind\u201d feature under \u201cNotifications\u201d. Toggle it ON.\nThe setup options are richer on iOS 15 and iPad OS 15 then on watchOS 8. On these platforms you can also choose to omit some locations. So for example, you can choose your home address as a place where you don\u2019t want to receive these types of alerts.\nWhats more, you can also set a range, something similar to GeoFencing. The options are Small, Medium and Large for the range \u2013 choose this and select Done to save the changes. This is essentially how far you need to be away from the item in order to get the Left Behind alert.\nHow to upgrade to watchOS 8 Beta\nApple has made the pre-release software available to the public. But installing Beta versions comes with risks. The software is work in progress so likely to feature some bugs. Plus, once you\u2019ve installed watchOS 8 Beta it is very difficult to revert back to the previous version.\nIf you\u2019d still like to upgrade, we\u2019ve written a handy guide on how to install watchOS 8 Beta, even if you\u2019re not a developer. Remember, your iPhone also has to be in Beta to run the new Apple Watch software.\nLike this article? Subscribe to our monthly newsletter and never miss out!",

The FTC will be able to decide on the size and the scope of the order, so it is not yet clear how Apple might be impacted.\nMultiple states have proposed right to repair legislation, which Apple has continually lobbied against. Apple claims that allowing independent repair shops to work on Apple devices without oversight would lead to security, safety, and quality issues. Many of the right to repair bills that have circulated call on tech companies to provide repair manuals and easy access to device components for repair purposes.\nApple does its own repairs in house at Apple retail stores and repair centers around the world, but it also works with Apple Authorized Service Providers to provide repair options. AASPs are managed by Apple and must meet Apple requirements, with some repairs and components limited.\nWhen Right to Repair bills began surfacing, Apple also launched a worldwide Independent Repair Program that is designed to provide repair shops that are not AASPs with genuine parts, tools, repair manuals, and diagnostics for performing out-of-warranty repairs on Apple devices.\nRepair shops have complained that Apple's program is too limited as it requires an Apple-certified technician to perform the repairs (available under a free program), and some parts are not provided to independent repair shops.\nBiden's executive order is expected to be released in the coming days, and White House economic adviser Brian Deese on Friday said that it is meant to spur \"greater competition in the economy\" as well as lower prices for American families.\nBack in November, the European Parliament also voted to develop new Right to Repair rules that will require companies to provide explicit information about the repairability and lifespan of products on consumer packaging. Under the terms of this order, manufacturers will need to provide a repair score, something that France has already enacted.",

        "body": "Apple will no longer prohibit marijuana delivery services from being hosted on its App Store\u2014one of the latest pro-cannabis developments to come out of the tech industry.\nThe policy was updated last month to remove the ban, with some restrictions. A marijuana app must be geo-restricted to jurisdictions where cannabis is legal, and the program must be \u201csubmitted by a legal entity that provides the services, and not by an individual developer.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what the previous policy said:\n\u201cApps that encourage consumption of tobacco and vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies), marijuana, or tobacco is not allowed.\nThe new policy, which was updated on June 7, reads:\n\u201cApps that encourage consumption of tobacco and vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies and licensed or otherwise legal cannabis dispensaries), or tobacco is not allowed.\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cApps that provide services in highly-regulated fields (such as banking and financial services, healthcare, gambling, legal cannabis use, and air travel) or that require sensitive user information should be submitted by a legal entity that provides the services, and not by an individual developer. Apps that facilitate the legal sale of cannabis must be geo-restricted to the corresponding legal jurisdiction.\u201d\nTechCrunch first reported on the new guidelines, and WeedWeek later flagged the marijuana-specific guidance.\nIn contrast, Google\u2019s Android app hub updated its policy in 2019 to explicitly prohibit programs that connect users with cannabis, no matter whether it is legal in the jurisdiction where the user lives.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t allow apps that facilitate the sale of marijuana or marijuana products, regardless of legality,\u201d it says, adding that some examples of violations would be \u201callowing users to order marijuana through an in-app shopping cart feature\u201d or \u201cassisting users in arranging delivery or pick up of marijuana.\u201d\nIt also says that \u201cfacilitating the sale of products containing THC(Tetrahydrocannabinol), including products such as CBD oils containing THC\u201d is against its policies.\nChris Vaughn, CEO of the California delivery service Emjay, told WeedWeek that he believes Apple\u2019s decision was informed by the continuing legalization movement in states like New York, as well as Amazon\u2019s recent announcement that it will no longer be drug testing workers for cannabis in addition to lobbying for a federal legalization bill. He added that he thinks Google will \u201cfollow quickly\u201d to update its own policies.\nThe tech industry has had a strained relationship with the marijuana industry, even as a growing number of states have decided to legalize and regulate the sale of cannabis.\nFacebook, which in 2019 showed off its artificial intelligence technology that\u2019s capable of identifying images of marijuana, continues to prohibit the commercial advertising of cannabis products, regardless of the legality of the business under state law.\nNoncommercial cannabis news sites such as Marijuana Moment and state regulatory bodies like the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission have also been caught up in the anti-marijuana policy despite the fact that they do not promote or sell cannabis products. In some cases, it appears these organizations have been hidden from appearing in search results\u2014a practice known as \u201cshadowbanning.\u201d\nDespite marijuana firms being banned from Google\u2019s app market, some of the company\u2019s top officials seem pretty bullish about loosening cannabis laws. Google co-founder Sergey Brin joked about supplying employees with joints at a post-election meeting in 2016.\n\u201cI was asking if we could serve joints outside on the patio, but apparently these things take a little while to take effect,\u201d Brin said, referring to the implementation of California\u2019s cannabis legalization measure. \u201cIt was a huge, huge disappointment.

        "body": "Credit: Google\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nApple has dramatically increased the amount of data that it stores on Google's cloud services, suggesting that its storage needs have grown faster than it can handle with its own servers.\nAs of May 2021, Apple was on track to spend about $300 million on Google cloud storage services in 2021, about a 50% increase year-over-year, a source told The Information.\nBack in November 2020 alone, Apple increased the amount of user data it stored on Google services by about 470 petabytes, bringing the total amount of data it had on Google's cloud to more than 8 exabytes. For reference, a single exabyte is enough to record a video call that's more than 237,000 years long.\nApple now ranks as the largest corporate client of Google's cloud services. Within Google, Apple even has a name indicative at its size: Bigfoot. Back in 2018, Apple confirmed that it used Google for user data storage needs.\nThe data needs of Apple also far eclipse any other Google customer. Apple's 470-petabyte increase in November was about the same as the total amount of storage used by Google's second largest customer, TikTok maker ByteDance.\nApple also appears to be getting a great deal for Google cloud storage. According to cost calculators on Google's website, storing 8 exabytes of data costs about $218 million per month. Apple, again, pays Google about $300 million per year storing the same amount.\nIt isn't clear why Apple's storage on Google cloud services has increased so dramatically. However, the purchase suggests that either it is more cost-effective for Apple to buy storage than it is to build out new capacity, or Apple has grown so big so quickly that it couldn't source, build, and maintain the first-party servers in a timely fashion that is needed to store the data.\nAfter Apple and ByteDance, Spotify was Google's third largest customer with about 460 petabytes of data, Twitter came in fourth with 315 petabytes, and Snapchat ranked third with about 275 petabytes.\nApple stores user iCloud data on both Amazon Web Services and Google's cloud. That data is encrypted by Apple, meaning that neither Amazon nor Google can obtain the the customer's iCloud information.\nAlthough AWS still accounts for a lion's share of the total cloud storage market, Google has carved out a niche for itself. Apple, for example, uses a form of Google cloud storage known as object storage, which is designed to handle data needs like audio and video files, as well as documents.",

However, while Apple Podcasts has evolved quite a bit since the \u201ctape player\u201d 1.0 version, it\u2019s not perfect. Today, I want to look at the good, the bad, and the ugly of Apple Podcasts with a particular focus on how the app still struggles to sync across multiple devices.\nI\u2019ve been listening to podcasts since 2004, so I consider myself somewhat of a veteran of the industry. I\u2019ve used every major podcast app on the market. I remember sideloading MP3 files into iTunes using iPodderX. I remember when Apple wouldn\u2019t approve third-party podcast apps because they \u201cduplicated functionality\u201d. As a result, I am pretty opinionated on how podcasts app should work and firmly believe that it\u2019s not a podcast unless you can subscribe in the app of your choice (don\u2019t try to convince me otherwise).\nThe Good\nApple Podcasts is a good app, but it\u2019s not great. It makes it easy to find new shows, follow them, and find the most recent episodes. It works great for shows where you need to listen in a particular order. In addition, it makes it easy to share a show over iMessage to friends. With iOS 15, it\u2019s even easy to see what shows have been shared with you. I really like the interface as it follows the same overall style as Apple Music. It\u2019s tightly integrated into the OS, so it\u2019s easy to use.\nI love the end-user experience of paying for premium content for specific shows. I subscribe to several premium podcasts directly with the creator, but the process of subscribing isn\u2019t as seamless as it is when you do it now in Apple Podcasts. I know Apple\u2019s payments aren\u2019t as easy on creators as Patreon or Memberful, but it\u2019s easy for the user.\nOverall, the app provides a great interface for sharing and finding new shows.\nThe Bad\nApple Podcasts isn\u2019t for power users, and that\u2019s okay. Apps like Overcast, Castro, and Pocket Cast can fill out the features that power users want. Apple does need to keep striving towards making it a great experience, though.\nAs I\u2019ve added more shows to my following list, the app has gotten slower and slower. I\u2019ve noticed this on iOS 14 and iOS 15. Apple Podcasts feels much heavier than Overcast in day-to-day usage. When you mark an episode as played, it can often take 4-5 seconds to actually reflect that status in the interface. With Overcast and Castro, marking as played is automatic and the UI immediately updates. I am not sure if this problem is a symptom of how many shows I subscribe to, but it makes the app almost unusable/\nThe Ugly\nThe syncing of followed shows on Apple Podcasts seems to work well. What doesn\u2019t seem to sync well is the Listen Now and Latest Episodes section of the app. I primarily listen to podcasts on my iPhone but occasionally like to listen to my Mac or iPad. Whenever I launch the apps, it\u2019s a hot mess as it tries to sync everything and never ends up getting the Listen Now and Latest Episodes in sync with what\u2019s on my iPhone. Then, if I do finally get them in sync manually, the iPhone somehow gets out of sync.\nWhat tends to happen is an episode that\u2019s marked as played on one device will show as played on another, but it will still be in the Listen Now. So why would it be in Listen Now if it\u2019s marked as played?\nThe image above shows what happened when I turned on syncing on Apple Podcasts on my Mac. It completely screwed up my library on my iPhone and brought back episodes previously marked as played into Up Next despite the fact they\u2019ve already been marked as played.\nTechnically, I am sure this is not easy to implement at Apple\u2019s scale. On the other hand, Overcast and Pocket Casts have figured out how to keep everything in sync across all of your devices so why can\u2019t Apple?\nIn 2021, seamless syncing to other devices is table stakes for a podcast app, and Apple has yet to figure out how to keep the apps in sync. Do you know how slow iMessage feels on your Mac if it\u2019s been closed for a week while you\u2019re on vacation and it\u2019s trying to catch up on processing messages? Apple Podcasts syncing behaves that way daily.\nWrap up\nApple focuses on the content side of podcasts, but I want them to spend equally as much effort on making the app faster and figure out what is keeping the apps from staying exactly in sync while adding new features. I want to love Apple Podcasts, but I\u2019ve found that the only way I can use the app is to only use it on my iPhone. Otherwise, it\u2019s hot garbage. I find myself wanting to use it every few weeks and quickly realize why it never sticks for me. The app is slow and struggles to sync across all of my devices.\nDo you use Apple Podcasts, or are you using a third-party alternative?

        "title": "Apple closing down internal Slack channels where employees debate remote work",
        "body": "Apple is closing down internal Slack channels to stop employees discussing remote working options, reports Zoe Schiffer from The Verge.\nMany Cupertino employees are currently engaged in a Cold War of sorts with their employer over the remote working arrangement coming out of the coronavirus pandemic. As the arguments flare up among staff, Apple has taken the step of shuttering the Slack channels where these are taking place.\n\u201cApple \u2026 recently began cracking down on Slack channels that aren\u2019t directly related to work,\u201d Schiffer wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe company bans channels \u2018for activities and hobbies\u2019 that aren\u2019t directly related to projects or part of official employee groups \u2014 but this wasn\u2019t always enforced, employees say.\u201d\nThe battle over remote working\nIn June, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that employees should get ready to return by early September. This is after more than one year working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Apple proposed a hybrid model in which employees would work at least three days a week in the office. The rest of the week would be spent working from home. It recently pushed these plans for an office return back until at least October. This was due to more coronavirus case flare-ups around the world.\nBut many Apple employees are none too happy about it. Two public letters from Apple employees have requested more flexible working conditions. A recent petition this month was shared on Apple\u2019s internal Slack channel, with more than 6,000 members discussing remote work. It noted that:\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned that this one-size-fits-all solution is causing many of our colleagues to question their future at Apple. With COVID-19 numbers rising again around the world, vaccines proving less effective against the delta variant, and the long-term effects of infection not well understood, it is too early to force those with concerns to come back to the office.\u201d\nAccording to Schiffer, \u201cinternally, [many] people feel like [Apple] isn\u2019t listening to their demands.\u201d She continues that: \u201cSince Friday, three Apple employees have resigned specifically because of the remote work policies. One had been at the company for nearly 13 years. I\u2019ve seen a bunch of these resignation notes and they\u2019re pretty heart wrenching.\u201d\nWhere things go from here\nIt remains to be seen what happens next: whether Apple softens its hybrid working model or some of the more vocal employee-critics back down (or quit.) However, removing Slack channels discussing the subject could be viewed as simply fanning the flames. If employees feel like Apple\u2019s ignoring their requests, then deleting the platforms in which they discuss these matters isn\u2019t going to be met with favorable responses.\nWhat do you think the solution to this stand-off is? Has your own place of work had to rethink the way work is carried out as a result of the pandemic, particularly when it comes to the return to the office? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.",

        "body": "Apple is planning to launch the \"M2\" chip with redesigned MacBook Air models in the first half of 2022, according to the leaker known as \"Dylandkt.\"\nOn Twitter, Dylandkt claimed that a new \u200cMacBook Air\u200c model is \"on track\" to launch in the first half of 2022, featuring an \u200cM2\u200c chip and a more colorful design. They also claimed that the \"M1X\" chip is being reserved for high-end \"Pro\" Macs, which could include the MacBook Pro and a larger, more powerful iMac model.\nJust wanted to share some details on when to expect the next generation M2 (not the M1X which is reserved for the Pro Mac devices). This processor is on track to release in the first half of 2022 alongside the upcoming colorful Macbook (Air). \u2014 Dylan (@dylandkt) July 5, 2021\n\u200cDylandkt\u200c's claim is not entirely new, given that Jon Prosser has previously said that the next-generation \u200cMacBook Air\u200c will feature a complete redesign, a range of iMac-like color options, and an \u200cM2\u200c chip.\n\u200cDylandkt\u200c has been resolute in previous comments about the \"M1X\" being destined for the next-generation MacBook Pro, while the \"\u200cM2\u200c\" will apparently be a lower-end chip for the \u200cMacBook Air\u200c, but it is worth noting that this does not seem to fit very well with the specific thoughts of reliable Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman about Apple's upcoming custom silicon chips for the Mac.\nNevertheless, \u200cDylandkt\u200c has correctly predicted details about a number of Apple's recent product launches. As early as November 2020, Dylandkt claimed that the next-generation iPad Pro would feature an M1 chip. This was five months before the device emerged. Before the launch of the 24-inch \u200ciMac\u200c earlier this year, \u200cDylandkt\u200c correctly predicted that the new, redesigned \u200ciMac\u200c would replace the smaller entry-level \u200ciMac\u200c only and feature an \u200cM1\u200c chip rather than an M1X. \u200cDylandkt\u200c's claim about the \u200cMacBook Air\u200c with the \u200cM2\u200c chip may therefore be more believable.",

        "body": "July 28, 2012: Apple buys biometrics company AuthenTec, acquiring the technology that will power future authentication and secure payments initiatives.\nWith a price tag of $356 million, the deal gives Apple the right to use AuthenTec hardware, software and patents. In the short term, Apple engineers start working to build Touch ID sensors into the iPhone 5s. Longer-term, AuthenTec\u2019s mobile wallet tech paves the way for Apple Pay.\niPhone fingerprint sensor: A long time in the making\nAlthough the dream of using fingerprint sensors on smartphones had been around for a while, AuthenTec\u2019s technology didn\u2019t work quite as planned at first.\nSpeaking in 2013, company co-founder F. Scott Moody recalled how an early demo for IBM went wrong in the worst possible way: It mistook IBM\u2019s chief technology officer for the other AuthenTec co-founder.\nHowever, once changes were made and a final product was exhibited, it didn\u2019t take long for companies including Motorola, Fujitsu and Apple to make overtures regarding a potential buyout. Apple ultimately won.\nNonetheless, Motorola actually beat Apple to the marketplace by two years when its Mobility Atrix 4G shipped with a fingerprint sensor in 2011. But while Motorola\u2019s technology worked reasonably well, it proved less than intuitive. The fingerprint scanner resided on the phone\u2019s back. And users needed to swipe it rather than simply touch it for authentication.\nAuthenTec tech makes Touch ID better\nApple\u2019s Touch ID solution, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t just secure. It proved very speedy as well \u2014 considerably quicker and easier than tapping in even a short, four-digit PIN.\n\u201cThe biggest thing Apple gets out of this is probably a strong play for using biometrics for identity in general \u2014 for online and brick-and-mortar purchases, for logging into websites and even for digital signatures,\u201d Cult of Mac wrote at the time of the AuthenTec acquisition.\nTouch ID arrived on the iPhone 5s in 2013, used initially only to unlock the handset. A year later, for the launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Apple expanded Touch ID\u2019s usefulness. Suddenly the fingerprint sensor worked to authenticate iTunes and App Store purchases via Apple Pay.\nTouch ID, Face ID and the future of Apple biometrics\nWith the launch of Face ID, the facial-recognition feature Apple rolled out in 2017 with the iPhone X, it appeared the days of Touch ID were largely at an end. However, Apple still incorporates the technology into its entry-level products.\nThe third-generation iPhone SE, released in early 2022, and the ninth-gen iPad, released in 2021, both utilize Touch ID in their old-school Home buttons.\nWhat did you think of Touch ID the first time you saw or used it? Are you happy that it\u2019s been replaced on newer iPhones? Leave your comments and recollections below.",

        "body": "Article Hero Image\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nLegendary Beatles producer Giles Martin in an interview this week discussed the advent of Dolby Atmos, the technology on which Apple's Spatial Audio format is built, revealing that he intends to create a new mix of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" because the current version \"doesn't sound quite right.\"\nSpeaking with Rolling Stone, Martin explained that \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" was among the first albums \u2014 perhaps the first \u2014 to receive a Dolby Atmos mix. While the result sounds \"good,\" it doesn't sound \"right\" in part because the mix was meant to be a theatrical presentation.\n\"Sgt. Pepper's,' how it's being presented right now, I'm actually going to change it. It doesn't sound quite right to me. It's out in Apple Music right now. But I'm gonna replace it. It's good. But it's not right,\" Martin said. \"Sgt. Pepper's was, I think, the first album ever mixed in Dolby Atmos. And we did that as a theatrical presentation. I liked the idea of the Beatles being the first to do something. It's cool that they can still be the first to do something. So Sgt. Pepper's is a theatrical mix that's then being converted into a smaller medium. Therefore, it's not quite right.\"\nThe mix lacks bass and \"a little bit of weight,\" he added, noting that the Dolby Atmos version of \"Abbey Road\" is \"much better-functioning\" because it is sonically closer to the stereo version.\n\"It's a bit like someone you love for years having a slightly different haircut. And you realize you still love them,\" Martin said of the new mixes.\nMartin also shared insight on Dolby Atmos for headphones, a technology that is incredibly difficult to get right. There has been \"exponential growth\" in the sector over the past two years, he said, but the technology is still in its infancy. While products like Apple's Spatial Audio is a good experience, it will get better as companies learn how to tweak their products to suit user needs.\n\"You can hear the difference with spatial audio. It may not always be better, but there's a difference,\" Martin said. \"I think we're learning the tools to provide that difference for people. What's great is that it creates more of a lean-in listening environment where you're paying attention to it, as opposed to just having audio being played into your head to stop you from thinking.\"\nInterestingly, Martin believes that advanced biometric tech like facial recognition, body measurements and in-ear pressure testing will one day be used to customize the listening experience. Perception of Dolby Atmos mixes in headphones is dependent on multiple variables, from head size to bone structure, and new technologies are needed to present recorded music as intended, he explains.\nApple introduced a form of hardware adaptation with the AirPods Pro ear tip fit test, which analyzes an earbud's seal by capturing speaker output with onboard microphones. AirPods Max goes a step further with Dynamic EQ, a system that measures sound signals within the headphone's ear cushions and adjusts sound output in real time.",

Apple had previously only contracted SMT, or Taiwan Surface Mounting Technology as its supplier for SMT processes in the mini-LED 12.9-inch iPad Pro and the upcoming MacBook Pros.\nApple first introduced a mini-LED display in its high-end 12.9-inch \u200ciPad Pro\u200c this past April. While the new iPad was announced in April, shipments of the device did not begin until later in May due to high demand and difficult production yield rates. Fueled by a global chip shortage and the continued global health crisis, Apple and its suppliers have faced challenges the past year in maintaining production of new devices.\nThe upcoming MacBook Pros are expected to be in high demand thanks to several long-awaited features and changes. Alongside a more powerful Apple silicon chip, the new MacBook Pros are rumored to include the first major redesign to the MacBook Pro since 2016, including flat-edges, removing the Touch Bar, and additional ports.\nDigiTimes says the new MacBook Pros are expected to launch in the fourth quarter of the year, which runs from October through December. The publication previously cited sources claiming an end-of-third-quarter launch for the new models, but early fourth quarter is more in line with industry expectations. Apple last year announced its M1 Apple silicon processor and an updated Mac mini, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro at a digital event in November.",

Beale, who claims his mother was on board the flight Thursday, an unnamed teen sent images of an airsoft gun to nearby iPhones via AirDrop, reports NBC's Bay Area affiliate.\nBound for Orlando, United Airlines Flight 2167 was preparing to leave the gate when passengers reported the incident, said airport spokesperson Doug Yakel. Everyone aboard was forced to disembark and go through a second screening process \"out of an abundance of caution,\" Yakel said.\nThe teen also made threats, according to Beale's account, as relayed by Gizmodo.\nIt was determined the photos were taken at an earlier date and not at the airport, and the teen did not have the gun on his person. Passengers reboarded after officials carried out a security inspection of the plane, and the teen was banned from the flight. It is unclear if he is facing further legal ramifications for his actions.\nHow the teen was identified is unclear. As Gizmodo notes, iOS users can anonymously send pictures, video and other media through AirDrop simply by changing their device name in system settings. It is theorized that the culprit forgot this crucial step or simply had no concerns about being caught.\nRecipients of AirDropped media are shown a preview of the image or video, which they can either accept or decline. This mechanic has caused problems in the past, as pranksters or unsavory characters can use the feature to present inappropriate content to victims.\nUsers can secure AirDrop and prevent receipt of unwanted photos by limiting AirDrop discoverability to known contacts. First, open Control Center by swiping down from the top right corner of the screen (iPhone X and newer) or up from the bottom of the screen (iPhone 8 and older), then press and hold the Bluetooth icon and tap on the AirDrop icon.

While the data is an indication of intent, the presence of a number in the data does not reveal whether there was an attempt to infect the phone with spyware such as Pegasus, the company\u2019s signature surveillance tool, or whether any attempt succeeded. The presence in the data of a very small number of landlines and US numbers, which NSO says are \u201ctechnically impossible\u201d to access with its tools, reveals some targets were selected by NSO clients even though they could not be infected with Pegasus. However, forensic examinations of a small sample of mobile phones with numbers on the list found tight correlations between the time and date of a number in the data and the start of Pegasus activity \u2013 in some cases as little as a few seconds. What did forensic analysis reveal? Amnesty examined 67 smartphones where attacks were suspected. Of those, 23 were successfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration. For the remaining 30, the tests were inconclusive, in several cases because the handsets had been replaced. Fifteen of the phones were Android devices, none of which showed evidence of successful infection. However, unlike iPhones, phones that use Android do not log the kinds of information required for Amnesty\u2019s detective work. Three Android phones showed signs of targeting, such as Pegasus-linked SMS messages. Amnesty shared \u201cbackup copies\u201d of four iPhones with Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto that specialises in studying Pegasus, which confirmed that they showed signs of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab also conducted a peer review of Amnesty\u2019s forensic methods, and found them to be sound. Which NSO clients were selecting numbers? While the data is organised into clusters, indicative of individual NSO clients, it does not say which NSO client was responsible for selecting any given number. NSO claims to sell its tools to 60 clients in 40 countries, but refuses to identify them. By closely examining the pattern of targeting by individual clients in the leaked data, media partners were able to identify 10 governments believed to be responsible for selecting the targets: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, India, and the United Arab Emirates. Citizen Lab has also found evidence of all 10 being clients of NSO. What does NSO Group say? You can read NSO Group\u2019s full statement here. The company has always said it does not have access to the data of its customers\u2019 targets. Through its lawyers, NSO said the consortium had made \u201cincorrect assumptions\u201d about which clients use the company\u2019s technology. It said the 50,000 number was \u201cexaggerated\u201d and that the list could not be a list of numbers \u201ctargeted by governments using Pegasus\u201d. The lawyers said NSO had reason to believe the list accessed by the consortium \u201cis not a list of numbers targeted by governments using Pegasus, but instead, may be part of a larger list of numbers that might have been used by NSO Group customers for other purposes\u201d. They said it was a list of numbers that anyone could search on an open source system. After further questions, the lawyers said the consortium was basing its findings \u201con misleading interpretation of leaked data from accessible and overt basic information, such as HLR Lookup services, which have no bearing on the list of the customers' targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products ... we still do not see any correlation of these lists to anything related to use of NSO Group technologies\u201d. Following publication, they explained that they considered a \"target\" to be a phone that was the subject of a successful or attempted (but failed) infection by Pegasus, and reiterated that the list of 50,000 phones was too large for it to represent \"targets\" of Pegasus. They said that the fact that a number appeared on the list was in no way indicative of whether it had been selected for surveillance using Pegasus. What is HLR lookup data? The term HLR, or home location register, refers to a database that is essential to operating mobile phone networks. Such registers keep records on the networks of phone users and their general locations, along with other identifying information that is used routinely in routing calls and texts. Telecoms and surveillance experts say HLR data can sometimes be used in the early phase of a surveillance attempt, when identifying whether it is possible to connect to a phone. The consortium understands NSO clients have the capability through an interface on the Pegasus system to conduct HLR lookup inquiries. It is unclear whether Pegasus operators are required to conduct HRL lookup inquiries via its interface to use its software; an NSO source stressed its clients may have different reasons \u2013 unrelated to Pegasus \u2013 for conducting HLR lookups via an NSO system.

Thank you for your feedback.\nForensics analysis of a small number of phones whose numbers appeared on the leaked list also showed more than half had traces of the Pegasus spyware.\nThe Guardian and its media partners will be revealing the identities of people whose number appeared on the list in the coming days. They include hundreds of business executives, religious figures, academics, NGO employees, union officials and government officials, including cabinet ministers, presidents and prime ministers.\nThe list also contains the numbers of close family members of one country\u2019s ruler, suggesting the ruler may have instructed their intelligence agencies to explore the possibility of monitoring their own relatives.\nThe disclosures begin on Sunday, with the revelation that the numbers of more than 180 journalists are listed in the data, including reporters, editors and executives at the Financial Times, CNN, the New York Times, France 24, the Economist, Associated Press and Reuters.\nThe phone number of a freelance Mexican reporter, Cecilio Pineda Birto, was found in the list, apparently of interest to a Mexican client in the weeks leading up to his murder, when his killers were able to locate him at a carwash. His phone has never been found so no forensic analysis has been possible to establish whether it was infected.\nNSO said that even if Pineda\u2019s phone had been targeted, it did not mean data collected from his phone contributed in any way to his death, stressing governments could have discovered his location by other means. He was among at least 25 Mexican journalists apparently selected as candidates for surveillance over a two-year period.\nWithout forensic examination of mobile devices, it is impossible to say whether phones were subjected to an attempted or successful hack using Pegasus.\nNSO has always maintained it \u201cdoes not operate the systems that it sells to vetted government customers, and does not have access to the data of its customers\u2019 targets\u201d.\nIn statements issued through its lawyers, NSO denied \u201cfalse claims\u201d made about the activities of its clients, but said it would \u201ccontinue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action\u201d. It said the list could not be a list of numbers \u201ctargeted by governments using Pegasus\u201d, and described the 50,000 figure as \u201cexaggerated\u201d.\nThe company sells only to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies in 40 unnamed countries, and says it rigorously vets its customers\u2019 human rights records before allowing them to use its spy tools.\nThe Israeli minister of defence closely regulates NSO, granting individual export licences before its surveillance technology can be sold to a new country.\nLast month, NSO released a transparency report in which it claimed to have an industry-leading approach to human rights and published excerpts from contracts with customers stipulating they must only use its products for criminal and national security investigations.\nThere is nothing to suggest NSO\u2019s customers did not also use Pegasus in terrorism and crime investigations, and the consortium also found numbers in the data belonging to suspected criminals.\nHowever, the broad array of numbers in the list belonging to people who seemingly have no connection to criminality suggests some NSO clients are breaching their contracts with the company, spying on pro-democracy activists and journalists investigating corruption, as well as political opponents and government critics.\nThat thesis is supported by forensic analysis on the phones of a small sample of journalists, human rights activists and lawyers whose numbers appeared on the leaked list. The research, conducted by Amnesty\u2019s Security Lab, a technical partner on the Pegasus project, found traces of Pegasus activity on 37 out of the 67 phones examined.\nQ&A What is the Pegasus project? Show The Pegasus project is a collaborative journalistic investigation into the NSO Group and its clients. The company sells surveillance technology to governments worldwide. Its flagship product is Pegasus, spying software \u2013 or spyware \u2013 that targets iPhones and Android devices. Once a phone is infected, a Pegasus operator can secretly extract chats, photos, emails and location data, or activate microphones and cameras without a user knowing. Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation, and Amnesty International had access to a leak of more than 50,000 phone numbers selected as targets by clients of NSO since 2016. Access to the data was then shared with the Guardian and 16 other news organisations, including the Washington Post, Le Monde, Die Zeit and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. More than 80 journalists have worked collaboratively over several months on the investigation, which was coordinated by Forbidden Stories. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\nThe analysis also uncovered some sequential correlations between the time and date a number was entered into the list and the onset of Pegasus activity on the device, which in some cases occurred just a few seconds later.\nAmnesty shared its forensic work on four iPhones with Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto that specialises in studying Pegasus, which confirmed they showed signs of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab also conducted a peer-review of Amnesty\u2019s forensic methods, and found them to be sound.\nThe presence of a number in the data does not mean there was an attempt to infect the phone. NSO says there were other possible purposes for numbers being recorded on the list.\nRwanda, Morocco, India and Hungary denied having used Pegasus to hack the phones of the individuals named in the list. The governments of Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, the UAE and Dubai did not respond to invitations to comment.\nThe Pegasus project is likely to spur debates over government surveillance in several countries suspected of using the technology. The investigation suggests the Hungarian government of Viktor Orb\u00e1n appears to have deployed NSO\u2019s technology as part of his so-called war on the media, targeting investigative journalists in the country as well as the close circle of one of Hungary\u2019s few independent media executives.\nThe leaked data and forensic analyses also suggest NSO\u2019s spy tool was used by Saudi Arabia and its close ally, the UAE, to target the phones of close associates of the murdered Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the months after his death. The Turkish prosecutor investigating his death was also a candidate for targeting, the data leak suggests.\nClaudio Guarnieri, who runs Amnesty International\u2019s Security Lab, said once a phone was infected with Pegasus, a client of NSO could in effect take control of a phone, enabling them to extract a person\u2019s messages, calls, photos and emails, secretly activate cameras or microphones, and read the contents of encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal.\nBy accessing GPS and hardware sensors in the phone, he added, NSO\u2019s clients could also secure a log of a person\u2019s past movements and track their location in real time with pinpoint accuracy, for example by establishing the direction and speed a car was travelling in.\nThe latest advances in NSO\u2019s technology enable it to penetrate phones with \u201czero-click\u201d attacks, meaning a user does not even need to click on a malicious link for their phone to be infected.\nGuarnieri has identified evidence NSO has been exploiting vulnerabilities associated with iMessage, which comes installed on all iPhones, and has been able to penetrate even the most up-to-date iPhone running the latest version of iOS. His team\u2019s forensic analysis discovered successful and attempted Pegasus infections of phones as recently as this month.\nApple said: \u201cSecurity researchers agree iPhone is the safest, most secure consumer mobile device on the market.\u201d\nNSO declined to give specific details about its customers and the people they target.\nHowever, a source familiar with the matter said the average number of annual targets per customer was 112. The source said the company had 45 customers for its Pegasus spyware.",

        "title": "Gurman: Face ID on the Mac Coming Within a 'Couple of Years'",
        "body": "Apple plans to bring Face ID to the Mac within the next \"couple of years,\" respected Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman said today in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter.\nIn the newsletter, Gurman says that he believes Apple's ultimate goal is to shift all of its products to \u200cFace ID\u200c, including the lower-end iPhones such as the iPhone SE and the iPad Air, which feature Touch ID. Gurman says \u200cTouch ID\u200c remains an important part of Apple's product lineup, especially for lower-end models, thanks to it being a \"cheaper alternative\" to \u200cFace ID\u200c while continuing to provide security to users.\nBut I expect that to eventually change. It won\u2019t happen this year, but I\u2019d bet Face ID on the Mac is coming within a couple of years. I expect all iPhones and iPads to transition to Face ID within that timeframe, too. Eventually, a camera embedded in the screen would help differentiate Apple\u2019s pricier devices by eliminating the notch at the top. The facial recognition sensor gives Apple two central features: security and augmented reality. Touch ID, more convenient or not, only provides the former.\nGurman had previously reported that as Apple was planning its recently launched redesigned 24-inch iMac, it had initially planned to include \u200cFace ID\u200c, but that \u200cFace ID\u200c implementation has been delayed to an upcoming \u200ciMac\u200c redesign instead. Unlike iPhones and iPads, Mac laptop screens are significantly thinner, making it harder to fit the necessary depth sensors for \u200cFace ID\u200c, Gurman notes.\nFurther down the line, Gurman says Apple will eventually embed \u200cFace ID\u200c into the screens themselves, abandoning the need for a notch on the iPhone. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes such an \u200ciPhone\u200c may debut as early as 2023. As for the Mac desktop, Apple is continuing to develop a replacement for the 27-inch iMac which may feature a larger screen and a more powerful \"M2X\" chip. Apple earlier this year paused work on the larger \u200ciMac\u200c to focus on the 24-inch \u200ciMac\u200c, which was released this past April.",

        "body": "Article Hero Image\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nApple has ejected a social app aimed at unvaccinated people from the App Store, in a bid to halt the spread of COVID-19 misinformation.\nUnjected, an app that launched in May and was originally intended for dating and introductions in a community that supports \"medical autonomy and free speech,\" was updated to introduce more social elements. A social feed gave users the opportunity to contribute content, which has since become a headache for the app's developers.\nAn app review for the Android version conducted by Google Play deemed it to have insufficiently policed the user-generated content for misinformation, reports Bloomberg. Emails sent to the developer by Google cited posts about the COVID-19 vaccines were at issue, including claims they were \"experimental mRNA gene modifiers,\" as well as mentions of 5G and microchip narratives.\nAfter Google advised the app to remove the posts in two weeks or face being pulled, the developers removed the social feed element. According to co-founder Shelby Thompson, there are plans to bring the social feed back, along with flagged posts, and intends to \"stay under the radar\" of Google's review teams.\nOther elements of the app remained untouched, including chat rooms, a directory of \"unvaxxed-friendly\" businesses, and a database of user blood types.\nAfter being contacted for the report, Apple has since pulled the app from the App Store. In its email to the developers, Apple says the app \"inappropriately refers to the COVID-19 pandemic in its concept or theme.\"\nUnjected is far from the first app to be pulled from the App Store for the views of app users.",
