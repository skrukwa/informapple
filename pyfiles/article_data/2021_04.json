        "body": "During its Spring Loaded event, Apple has finally unveiled the long-rumored and profusely leaked AirTag, its item tracker integrated into the Find My network. We\u2019ve known about this product since early 2019, when 9to5Mac reported about its development. Since then, the product has made several appearances in iOS builds and even appeared briefly in a YouTube video on Apple\u2019s Support channel.\nAirTags can be attached to any item in order to track it using the Find My app. Earlier this month, Apple also announced the initial set of third-party products that will be integrated into the app. AirTags include UWB functionality called \u201cPrecision Finding,\u201d which enables precise location when looking for a lost item nearby, including haptic feedback.\nAs we\u2019ve seen before, the pairing process for AirTags is very similar to that of AirPods: just bring an unpaired AirTag next to your iOS device in order to add it to your iCloud account. Multiple tags can be paired in sequence.\nThe product includes privacy protection features. If one of your Apple devices notices that you\u2019ve been carrying an AirTag that\u2019s not yours, it will alert you. AirTags will be available for purchase starting April 30, and each tag costs $29. There\u2019s also a 4-pack available for $99.\nFollow along with all of Apple\u2019s announcements at its Spring Loaded special event in our live news hub right here.",

        "title": "Apple presses ahead with aim to replace paper passports and ID with iPhone",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nSpot the difference - one of these is entirely digital, but the other two already include digital elements\nApple is continuing to research how to ensure the identity of someone presenting an iPhone to a passport official, or using any other digital ID document.\nThis is coming \u2014 your passport, drivers' licence, and probably all paper ID is going to go digital. The iPhone has already replaced everything from wallets to compact mirrors, and if it doesn't know when ID will make the move to digital, Apple is certain it's going to happen.\nThe company has already applied for multiple patents on related issues, including how an official can request what ID data from an iPhone. Now a newly-revealed patent application is concentrating on authenticating that the person holding an iPhone with digital ID is the real owner.\n\"User authentication framework,\" is about how to \"securely perform a user authentication\" when asked by \"an issuing authority.\"\n\"[This patent application] describes embodiments in which a person may present identification information through a mobile device instead of presenting a traditional form of identification,\" says Apple. \"[It] begins with a discussion about storing identification information (e.g., of a passport, driver license, government-issued ID, student ID, etc.) on a mobile device... [And] then describes an authentication framework for performing a user authentication at the mobile device.\"\nThe issues, detailed in around 13,000 words of patent application, range from the communications protocols, through secure storage, and on to making the process \"tamper-resistant.\"\nApple does not want to limit its patent application too specifically, but for examples of communications protocols, it does refer to both NFC and RFID. It also describes the use of a biosensor \u2014 such as Face ID \u2014 to authenticate the user, plus a secure enclave to hold private data.\nDetail from the patent showing a simplified process for authenticating ID\nNicely, it also discusses just how much information to give up when asked. Just as payment systems today can ask Apple's T2 chip to confirm identity and that processor will solely return a yes or no, so ID could sometimes work the same way.\n\"[For instance], the mobile device may perform an authentication,\" says Apple, \"that includes the secure element confirming whether a holder of an identification document has an attribute satisfying some criterion without providing that attribute (or at least providing some information about that attribute without providing all information about that attribute).\"\n\"For example, in one embodiment, a person may be attempting to purchase an item that requires the merchant to confirm whether an age of the person satisfies some threshold value,\" continues Apple. \"[Rather] than having the user present the identification document (e.g., a driver license), the reader of the merchant may ask the secure element to confirm whether the user of the mobile device is old enough to purchase the item.\"\nIf the owner has been positively identified by, for instance, Face ID, and if their date of birth is stored in the secure enclave, the vender just needs a thumbs up or thumbs down. \"In doing so, the mobile device is able to protect a user's identification information, yet still adequately answer the merchant's inquiry.\"\nMost of the patent application's detail describes more complex scenarios, or where much more information is needed. At passport control, for instance, a user's full ID may be crucial \u2014 but so is the need for that user to be certain they're talking to authorized officials.\nSo the patent describes different combinations of security keys and authentication, where both user and official have their ID authenticated.\nIf it sounds as if digital ID is at risk of being stolen, it is. But that's why Apple is sweating these specific details. And if it doesn't want to point out that your passport can be taken from your hands, it does want to note that we already have digital ID.\n\"For example, modern passports (called e-Passports) may include an electronic chip that stores a passport holder's name, date of birth, and other forms of information,\" says Apple. \"When a person is passing through customs, the person may present the passport to a customs officer, who places the passport on a reader to extract information stored in the passport.\"\n\"Upon verifying the information printed on the passport against the internally stored information, the officer may confirm the identity of the holder and allow the holder passage through customs,\" it continues.\nHaving that confirmation instead take place between the customs system and the user's iPhone, unlocked with Face ID, is immediately going to be more secure.\nThis patent application is credited to three inventors, including Ahmer A. Khan, who previously worked on a related filing about securely presenting ID wirelessly.",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s AirTag relies on a feature no competitor can match: One billion iPhones",
        "body": "Apple announced a long-awaited gadget called AirTag. Users can attach the $29 coin-sized device to valuables like keys or a backpack, then locate it on a live map inside Apple\u2019s built-in Find My software.\nAirTag competes with a number of other products on the market, including from Tile, whose general counsel complained before Congress on Wednesday about Apple\u2019s overall dominance.\nBut AirTag\u2019s most important differentiating feature isn\u2019t the technology inside the $29 coin-sized stainless steel gadget. It\u2019s other people\u2019s iPhones.\nAirTag doesn\u2019t have a GPS signal, which would rapidly drain its battery and raise privacy questions. Instead, when it\u2019s attached to a lost object, it sends out scrambled Bluetooth signals. For those signals to reach the reach the internet and inform the person who\u2019s looking for their lost device, they\u2019ll need to find an iPhone that\u2019s listening for them.\n\u2033Using Bluetooth and the hundreds of millions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices in active use around the world, the user can locate a missing device even if it can\u2019t connect to a Wi-Fi or cellular network,\u201d Apple explained in a security disclosure about the Find My service. \u201cAny iOS, iPadOS, or macOS device with \u2018offline finding\u2019 enabled in Find My settings can act as a \u2019finder device.\u201d\nThe product represents a new frontier for Apple: Using its install base of over 1 billion iPhones as infrastructure to build services that its competitors can\u2019t. Now iPhones are part of a physical network out in the world that\u2019s looking out for stolen goods \u2014 even if their users have never purchased an AirTag.\n\u201cThe bottom line is AirTag is an example of Apple leveraging its ecosystem to create a more compelling product than what is currently in the market,\u201d Loup Ventures founder Gene Munster wrote in a newsletter on Tuesday. \u201cSpecifically, AirTag will have better navigation and discovery features, along with a billion-plus device network that can be utilized to help locate lost items.\u201d\nEnrolling in the Find My network does have benefits to iPhone users who don\u2019t buy AirTags. Many users sign up because the same app can be used to find lost Apple products, and it\u2019s easy to do when signing into an iCloud account on an iPhone.\nThe Find My network can be used to find an iPhone after it\u2019s been shut off, as thieves often do after stealing a phone. (If the device is on, it can be contacted through Find My iPhone, a similar service that uses the device\u2019s internet connection and predates the Find My network.)\nUsers can also opt out of the Find My network in Apple\u2019s settings, although that means they don\u2019t get the benefits of the network, like finding devices that have been turned off or aren\u2019t connected to cellular or Bluetooth. (To do so, go to Settings > Your Name > Find My > Find My iPhone > and then toggle \u201cFind My network\u201d on or off.)\nA vast, global network\nThe number of devices participating in the network is crucial for a product like AirTag.\nApple describes its Find My service as a \u201cvast, global network\u201d and allows third-party accessory makers to release products that use it, too.\nIf an AirTag is lost in the middle of a desert with no Apple devices in Bluetooth range, it can\u2019t connect to the internet to send signals or update the user\u2019s map. But in the middle of an American city, where an estimated 42% of people have iPhones \u2014 more in some areas \u2014 you\u2019re much more likely to find a device that\u2019s looking for your lost AirTag.\nApple CEO Tim Cook has previously described Apple\u2019s product strategy as \u201conly Apple,\u201d suggesting that because the company builds hardware, develops software, and runs its own online services, it can introduce features that rivals like Microsoft, Google, or Samsung can\u2019t.\nWhile Samsung or other major smartphone vendors have similar numbers of phones in people\u2019s hands, they don\u2019t control the underlying operating system, making features like Find My much more difficult to implement widely at once.\nFor Apple, AirTag is probably an effort to add distinguishing features to its iPhone to discourage current users from switching to an Android device. It\u2019s not likely to be a major revenue driver.\n\u201cWhile the Airtags are incremental to our model we do not believe even a very successful launch of that product will have much impact on our forecasts given the low $29 price point,\u201d Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall wrote in a note.\nIf Apple becomes more skilled at using its installed devices as privacy-sensitive infrastructure, it could represent a durable advantage for the company. Apple\u2019s installed base of iPhones could become especially important as it invests heavily in augmented reality, a technology that merges the physical and digital worlds.\nA network of location-aware iPhones could be used in augmented reality apps like Pokemon Go, for example, to identify where other players are competing and start a group experience. It provides the sensors and internet connection needed building for digital experiences in the real world without building new equipment each time.\nThe privacy angle\nAirTag also represents a major test for Apple\u2019s privacy positioning.\nSince 2015, Apple has advertised privacy and security as major differentiators for its iPhone. It has consistently built systems, like Covid-tracking exposure notifications, that are decentralized, which means that they are designed in a way that data is processed and calculated on a device, instead of on servers that Apple can access.\nApple is building on that reputation to assure customers that its Find My system won\u2019t leak user location or data when acting as a finding device. Apple says that the Find My network keeps location data private and anonymous, and that it doesn\u2019t store location data or history.\nHow Apple pulls it off is a matter of complicated software engineering. \u201cFind My is built on a foundation of advanced public key cryptography,\u201d Apple\u2019s security disclosure says.\nNow Apple\u2019s users will need to decide whether they understand and trust the Find My network and Apple \u2014 both as users of them, and as iPhone users participating in them to make them work better.",

        "title": "Apple Event Officially Announced for Tuesday, April 20",
        "body": "Following an overnight leak by Siri, Apple today officially announced that it will be holding a special \"Spring Loaded\" event on Tuesday, April 20 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time at the Steve Jobs Theater on the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California.\nAs with all of Apple's 2020 events, the April 2021 event will be a digital-only gathering with no members of the media invited to attend in person due to the ongoing public health crisis.\nApple's April event will see Apple showing off the first new products of 2021, and there's quite a lot on the horizon. Updated iPad Pro models, a new low-cost iPad , a new iPad mini , refreshed iMacs, and the long-awaited AirTags are all products that Apple could potentially introduce.\nGiven that we're waiting on so many \u200ciPad\u200c refreshes, iPads could be the focus of the April event. Apple is rumored to be working on a new high-end 12.9-inch iPad Pro that will feature a mini-LED display and a 5G chip, and there's an 11-inch model coming too. These iPads are expected to feature Thunderbolt connectivity, camera improvements, and a new A14X chip that's as fast as the M1 chip in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini.\nA sketchy rumor said Apple will debut an \"\u200ciPad mini\u200c Pro\" with an 8.7-inch full-screen display and no Touch ID Home button. There have also been rumors of an \u200ciPad mini\u200c with a mini-LED display, but it's not clear just what \u200ciPad mini\u200c upgrades we'll get, as recent dummy model photos have suggested there could be few obvious differences from the current model. We could also see a new low-cost iPad with a 10.2-inch display and a thinner build that's similar to the now-discontinued iPad Air 3.\nAs for the AirPods 3, Apple is working on a new version that looks similar to the AirPods Pro with silicone ear tips and shorter stems, but without the high-end Active Noise Cancellation functionality. There were rumors that AirPods 3 would be coming at the spring event, but we're no longer expecting them until the fall.\nApple is designing a revamped iMac with a new design that features thinner bezels that are similar to the bezels on the Pro Display XDR, plus it will have an Apple silicon chip and an Apple-designed GPU, making it a highly-anticipated machine. We don't know when new iMacs are coming, but an April event is a possibility.\nWe're still waiting on \u200cAirTags\u200c, which are Apple's Tile-like Bluetooth tracking tags that will be able to be attached to any item, allowing that item to be tracked right in the Find My app alongside Apple devices. Apple just last week expanded its \u200cFind My\u200c network to include third-party devices such as an upcoming item tracker from Chipolo, so next week's event could finally see the \u200cAirTags\u200c unveiled as Apple's similar product offering.\nThere's also a sixth-generation Apple TV in the works with an upgraded processor and a new \u200cApple TV\u200c remote with \u200cFind My\u200c integration, but it's not clear if the \u200cApple TV\u200c will be coming at the April event.\nApple plans to stream the\u200c event live on its website and in the \u200cApple TV\u200c app when it kicks off at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on April 20. For those unable to watch, MacRumors will be providing full event coverage both on MacRumors.com and through the MacRumorsLive Twitter account.",

        "title": "Next-gen Apple Silicon 'M2' chip reportedly enters production, included in MacBooks in second half of year - 9to5Mac",
        "body": "According to Nikkei, the next-generation of Apple silicon \u2014 tentatively dubbed \u201cM2\u201d \u2014 has entered the production cycle. Chip ramps are slow, and Nikkei indicates that beginning production now means the chips would be available in mass supply as soon as July. This schedule likely means they will be included in new MacBook models in the fall, probably the upcoming revamped MacBook Pro line.\nThe 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU M1 chip architecture delivered impressive performance and battery life when it debuted in the first Apple Silicon Macs last fall. Apple used the same chip in the just-announced iMac and 2021 iPad Pro. However, the chip has some limitations that pro users are hoping will be addressed in the second-generation.\nMost notably, the M1 chip only supports a maximum of two Thunderbolt ports and allows for just one external display output. For instance, in the fall Apple launched the two-Thunderbolt-port 13-inch MacBook Pro model with the M1chip, but the 4-port 13-inch MacBook Pro remains in the lineup.\nAlso while the M1 chip delivers incredible power efficiency and raw power, it does not outstrip higher-end Intel Macs on all benchmarks. Specifically, the integrated graphics of the M1 chip do not match up to dedicated graphics cards included in high-spec iMacs or MacBook Pros. The expectation is that the M2 chip (or \u201cM1X,\u201d however it is branded) will add more CPU and GPU performance, more Thunderbolt lanes, and allow for at least two external displays.\nThe M1 chip is made up of an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU with unified RAM architecture. Last year, Bloomberg said Apple was developing a successor to the M1 featuring 20 CPU cores destined for its high-end laptops. ARM Mac desktops like the Mac Pro or iMac Pro could feature 32-core chip designs.\nIn today\u2019s report, Nikkei says that the M2 will continue to integrate CPU, GPU and the Neural Engine on the same chip. However, it does not go into any more detail on the chip\u2019s specifications.\nApple is widely rumored to be readying new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, featuring Apple Silicon internals in a new chassis design, featuring the return of MagSafe, SD card reader and HDMI ports. Schematics of the as-yet-unannounced products were released in the recent REvil ransomware leak.",

        "body": "The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is set to release an open letter to artists later today. Most significantly, the letter says that Apple Music pays one cent per stream. That is roughly twice what Spotify pays, according to estimates.\nStreaming services are trying to show that they are friendly to artists, especially as revenue from concerts and tours cratered during the pandemic. In the same vein, Apple recently invested in an independent music artist platform called UnitedMasters.\nArtists with songs streaming in Apple Music will welcome the transparency, but many argue that the rates should be higher.\nMusic-rights holders have publicly protested about the current state of revenue sharing in music streaming, in the hope that new deals can be negotiated with the leading platforms like Apple Music and Spotify.\nAlthough Apple Music pays more per stream, overall revenue from Spotify is higher as Spotify simply has more users. Apple Music last reported that it had crossed the 60 million user mark in June 2019. It has not released up-to-date subscriber numbers in the two years since. Spotify boasts more than 150 million paid subscribers, plus another 200 million using the ad-free tier.\nIn the open letter, Apple says it \u201cbelieves in paying every creator the same rate, that a play has a value, and that creators should never have to pay for featuring\u201d.\nOf course, each per-stream cent of a song does not go straight into an artist\u2019s pocket. That cent is divvied up between each of the different rights holders, such as labels, publishers and other distributors. Ultimately, only a fraction of that cent goes to the artist.\nHowever, when the going price of a music streaming service is $9.99 per month, there isn\u2019t that much wiggle room to increase the per-stream rate.",

        "title": "Apple admits that iMessage for Android was killed to keep its walled garden",
        "body": "The legal conflict between Epic Games and Apple has already had some fairly substantial fallout. The court of public opinion pressed Apple and Google to reduce marketplace fees for developers on the App Store and Play Store, and a number of Apple's antics have fallen under the scrutiny of politicians and the general public. The hearing also shined light on iMessage's Apple exclusivity, with the company admitting that it kept the messaging platform from Android in order to create a lock-in effect. But apparently that stance wasn't shared with everyone across the board. It turns out that Apple executive Eddy Cue wanted to bring iMessage to Android in 2013, only to be shut down by peers, as a new deposition shows.\nIt's no secret that Apple maintains a number of proprietary products and services to keep its users from casually jumping to competing platforms, but few have been quite as successful as iMessage. In preparation for the trial beginning May 3rd, Epic Games filed a brief containing excerpts demonstrating Apple's executive team made an intentional decision to limit iMessage to Apple's own platforms.\nThe line of questioning in the depositions is aimed at demonstrating Apple's use of platform lock-in to create a monopoly that keeps users reliant on the App Store and In-App Payment system, which came under fire when Epic launched a version of Fortnite that skirted Apple's payment systems.\n58. Apple has recognized the power that iMessage has to attract and keep users within its ecosystem. a. As early as 2013, Apple decided not to develop a version of iMessage for the Android OS. (Cue Dep. 92:22-93:1.) b. Mr. Cue testified that Apple \u201ccould have made a version on Android that worked with iOS\u201d such that there would \u201chave been cross-compatibility with the iOS platform so that users of both platforms would have been able to exchange messages with one another seamlessly\u201d. (Cue Dep. 92:5-9; 92:11-16.) c. However, Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering and the executive in charge of iOS, feared that \u201ciMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones\u201d. (PX407, at \u2018122.) d. Phil Schiller, an Apple executive in charge of the App Store, agreed that Apple should not offer iMessage on Android devices. (Cue Dep. 92:18-93:1.) e. In 2016, when a former Apple employee commented that \u201cthe #1 most difficult [reason] to leave the Apple universe app is iMessage . . . iMessage amounts to serious lock-in\u201d to the Apple ecosystem, Mr. Schiller commented that \u201cmoving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why\u201d. (PX416, at \u2018610; Cue Dep. 114:14-115:2.)\nThe statements cite Eddy Cue (SVP of Internet Software and Services) acknowledging Apple was capable of developing a version of iMessage for Android as early as 2013. However, Craig Federighi (SVP of Software Engineering) and Phil Schiller (SVP of Worldwide Marketing) expressed concerns that it would hurt the company if it made software available that removes an obstacle for people that may otherwise want to use Android. An additional comment by another Apple employee emphasizes that iMessage is the biggest factor in keeping people in Apple's ecosystem and refers to it as \"serious lock-in.\"\nThe Verge adds more details to the conversation, citing the most recent deposition. Cue was a proponent of creating a full-time team working on bringing iMessage to Android in 2013. Following rumors that Google wanted to buy WhatsApp for $1 billion, Cue argued that Apple had to expand its platform to competitors in order to keep Google from dominating the messaging market (a distant fear given how scattershot the company's current chat efforts are). Others, like Craig Federighi, were quick to argue that just having a better platform, like iMessages, wasn't enough to dominate the social media market \u2014 he said that Google wanted to buy WhatsApp for that much money precisely because it already had so many users.\nThe Verge reconstructed the email exchange between Cue and Craig Federighi, highlighting the clashing opinions on the matter:\nCue: We really need to bring iMessage to Android. I have had a couple of people investigating this but we should go full speed and make this an official project.... Do we want to lose one of the most important apps in a mobile environment to Google? They have search, mail, free video, and growing quickly in browsers. We have the best messaging app and we should make it the industry standard. I don\u2019t know what ways we can monetize it but it doesn\u2019t cost us a lot to run. Federighi: Do you have any thoughts on how we would make switching to iMessage (from WhatsApp) compelling to masses of Android users who don\u2019t have a bunch of iOS friends? iMessage is a nice app/service, but to get users to switch social networks we\u2019d need more than a marginally better app. (This is why Google is willing to pay $1 billion \u2014 for the network, not for the app.)...In the absence of a strategy to become the primary messaging service for [the] bulk of cell phone users, I am concerned [that] iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.\nOf course, there's no technical limitation preventing Apple from developing iMessage for Android, and most people already assume this has been a strategic decision. Apple has never commented on whether it plans to build a version of iMessage for Android, but with these statements in the open, it's easy to understand why there has been radio silence on the subject. It doesn't look good for public opinion, and it may help Epic Games in making its case about unfair business practices toward developers, but the practice isn't illegal and likely won't draw attention from regulators \u2014 which means Apple is likely to stay the course. In other words, don't expect iMessage to officially hit Android anytime soon.",

        "title": "Put macOS on the iPad, you cowards.",
        "body": "Okay, hear me out on this. I really would just like Apple\u2019s next iPad Pro to be a laptop. Not a clamshell, but a Surface Pro type of deal: a tablet with laptop hardware and a laptop OS. I think there must be people at Apple who want this, too, so I\u2019m now respectfully requesting that the company stop dilly-dallying and make it happen.\nHere\u2019s my reasoning: at Tuesday\u2019s Spring Loaded event, Apple finally unveiled a long-rumored update to its iPad Pro. While the device doesn\u2019t look too different from iPad Pro models of years past, it\u2019s a huge leap forward on the inside because it\u2019s powered by Apple\u2019s eight-core M1 processor. That\u2019s the same processor that powers its MacBook Air and MacBook Pro (as well as the Mac mini), and it\u2019s exceptional. To repeat, the new iPad Pro isn\u2019t using a Macbook-adjacent or MacBook-equivalent processor. It\u2019s using the same processor that\u2019s in those laptops.\nLet\u2019s review what else the iPad Pro can do. It now supports Thunderbolt 3 and can power additional displays at up to 6K resolution. It supports 5G. It can come with up to 2TB of storage and 16GB of RAM. You can connect a keyboard and touchpad. On paper, that\u2019s a laptop. (Or it\u2019s a Surface Pro, whatever you want to call that.)\nImage: Apple\nBut that\u2019s before you actually use the thing. Personally, I just can\u2019t use iPadOS for my daily multitasking workload. On a MacBook, I can duck in and out of Zoom calls to mess around in Chrome and keep several tabs and applications open on my screen at once. Doing that on the iPad is, comparatively, a mess \u2014 I can reasonably look at one or two apps max, resizing is a pain, and it doesn\u2019t take full advantage of my external display.\nFurthermore, iOS apps still have less functionality than their macOS counterparts across the board. A MacBook can just do more. And until the iPad Pro gains the ability to run macOS apps (or, dare I suggest, macOS), I don\u2019t see that calculus changing. I\u2019m far from a creative professional, but I still need my daily driver to be able to run the full version of Photoshop.\nBut now that the iPad Pro is an M1 system, I don\u2019t see why it can\u2019t run macOS apps. Because it has the same hardware as the MacBook Air (including the fanless form factor). So the iPad really should be able to run whatever the MacBook Air can run. (And the MacBook Air can run just about whatever you want. Take a look at our review for a deep dive there.)\nBattery is a potential pitfall: the larger iPad has a nearly 20 percent smaller battery than the Air (40.88Whr to the Air\u2019s 49.9Whr). But both M1 MacBooks have excellent battery life, and the larger iPad\u2019s battery is still similar in size to that of Lenovo\u2019s ThinkPad X12 Detachable and bigger than that of the Surface Pro X \u2014 neither of which have been a disaster in our testing. So I\u2019d be surprised if it can\u2019t get the job done.\nApple has also shown that it\u2019s not afraid to bring consumers into a messy software transition. After all, the new M1 MacBooks can run iPhone and iPad apps natively. Many of them, upon the machines\u2019 release, weren\u2019t available or didn\u2019t work well. The sky did not fall.\nAnd of course, Apple has been working to make its ecosystem more cohesive for quite a while. Catalyst makes it more convenient for developers to port their apps between iPadOS and macOS. And many of the tweaks the company made to macOS Big Sur seem specifically designed to bring the operating system closer to the look and feel of iOS \u2014 from the rounded window corners and iOS-ified dock icons to the newly translucent layers \u2014 and some of its new features (like the new Control Center and the native iOS apps) are iPad staples that don\u2019t make a ton of sense to have on a non-touch device.\nThe result of all this is that we\u2019re moving toward a weird point in the evolution of these two devices where the MacBook can do everything the iPad can do (but it doesn\u2019t have the touchscreen hardware to take advantage of all of it), while the iPad can still only do iPad things (even though features of macOS would take good advantage of its touchscreen capability). It seems like a point where Apple\u2019s goals of \u201ccreating a seamless ecosystem\u201d and \u201cselling you many different products\u201d are starting to butt heads.\nSo putting macOS apps on the iPad seems like a natural next step in Apple\u2019s process. And from a consumer perspective, I think it could only be a good thing.\nHere\u2019s what video calls on the iPad are supposed to look like. Video: Apple\nIn addition to the touch capability and stylus support, the new iPad Pro makes up for the MacBook\u2019s greatest weakness: its grainy garbage webcam. The iPad Pro has been upgraded with a new 12MP TrueDepth ultrawide camera and a feature called Center Stage, which will follow you around and keep your face centered during video chats. This is a great feature for students and professionals who have to take a lot of conference calls from home (myself included) and don\u2019t want to deal with an external device. That said: video calls are kind of a pain on iPadOS (in part because the camera is still on the side, in landscape mode), and, as I noted above, multitasking during them is a lot harder than it is on a MacBook. macOS and the iPad\u2019s camera hardware seem like a good fit.\nThere\u2019s also the larger iPad\u2019s new Liquid Retina XDR display, which looks like it\u2019s going to be a game-changer. Incorporating over 10,000 Mini LEDs, it\u2019s said to reach 1,000 nits of brightness (which is brighter than many 4K HDR TVs on the market). And 1,000-nit Windows laptops exist (as do Mini LED laptops), but it\u2019s uncommon to see them under the $2,000 price point. This isn\u2019t hardware that the average office user needs \u2014 but in a laptop, it would be one of the best screens you can get at its price point, hands down.\nNow, would an iPad Pro running macOS be the right purchase for everyone? Of course not. Not everyone wants to work on a 12.9-inch screen all day. I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019d probably find it cramped. I also know people who use the 12.3-inch Surface Pro 7 as their primary driver with no complaints. Many folks care more about having a full-featured PC in a convertible and super versatile form factor than they do about having a big screen.",

        "title": "Two-Thirds of iPhone Users Expected to Block Ad Tracking",
        "body": "As many as 68 percent of iPhone users are expected to deny advertisers permission to track them thanks to Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature, in what is beginning to look like a significant blow to the advertising industry (via AdWeek).\nWith the launch of iOS 14.5, apps will have to receive explicit user permission before accessing an \u200ciPhone\u200c's advertising identifier or IDFA, which is used to track usage across apps and websites for ad targeting purposes.\nChief analytics officer at marketing company Epsilon, Loch Rose, said \"nobody really knows for sure\" what will happen once Apple's tracking prompts become widespread, but the cost per mille of in-app ads, which is the cost an advertiser pays for one thousand views or impressions, is expected to drop by as much as 50 percent.\nThe initial outlook for the number of users giving consent to track looks bleak, with a median opt-in rate of just 32 percent, according to an analysis of 300 apps across 2,000 devices from AppsFlyer, a mobile marketing and attribution company.\nThe analysis found that apps with higher consumer affinity saw higher opt-in rates, hovering around 40 percent, but some companies such as dating app Bumble are expecting as few as 20 percent of users to opt-in at most, with its lowest opt-in forecast being for less than one percent of users.\nMajor digital ad company Trade Desk said that 10 percent of the 12 million ad opportunities per second on its platform are tied directly to IDFA metrics.\nThere is concern in the advertising industry that widespread opt-outs would lead to the complete deprecation of IDFAs, making ad targeting and performance information almost impossible on Apple platforms, since a key piece of data for advertising would essentially be removed and a certain number of users will no longer be targetable at all.\nIf opt-out rates are high and IDFAs become scarce, app developers and publishers are expecting revenues to be hit in the short term. Advertisers are also aware that opt-in rates may not be consistent when the feature is widely adopted, which may exacerbate the level of uncertainty and lead to inconsistent data.\nApproximately 58 percent of advertisers are reportedly planning to move their businesses out of Apple's ecosystem and invest in other areas like Android devices or connected TV as a result of the change.",

(WTVD) -- Big news for North Carolina -- Apple unveiled plans to build a campus and engineering hub in the Research Triangle, committing more than $1 billion in investments and creating at least 3,000 new jobs for the area.\nThe Monday morning announcement establishes the company's first major east coast footprint, and its first entirely new U.S. campus in more than 20 years--Apple chose to expand its campus in Austin, Texas, instead of its North Carolina presence in 2018. Cooper said, \"I believe this project is much more transformational than the expansion we would have gotten in 2018.\"\nThe hub will bring plenty of jobs to the local technology industry including machine learning, artificial intelligence, software engineering and \"other cutting edge fields.\"\nWhen completed, Apple said its investments will generate more than $1.5 billion in annual economic benefits for North Carolina.\n\"As a North Carolina native, I'm thrilled Apple is expanding and creating new long-term job opportunities in the community I grew up in,\" said Jeff Williams, Apple's Chief Operating Officer. \"We're proud that this new investment will also be supporting education and critical infrastructure projects across the state. Apple has been a part of North Carolina for nearly two decades, and we're looking forward to continuing to grow and a bright future ahead.\"\nHiring for the new campus is expected to begin immediately, according to an Apple spokesperson. The company plans to lease local office space to accommodate new workers until construction on the 1,000,000 square foot campus is complete on land secured by Apple in Wake County near RTP.\n\"Even in a pandemic, North Carolina has been on a run with 10 companies and thousands of new jobs in both rural and urban North Carolina announced within just the last two months. Well it's about to be 11 and this may be the biggest of them all,\" Gov.

It also proves that we have the right combination of talent and innovation to attract industry-leading companies who want an exceptional quality of life for their employees.\"\nGovernor Roy Cooper and the state Commerce Department have been negotiating with the company on tax incentives to land the new campus. An Apple spokesperson confirms the company is accepting Job Development and Investment Grants (JDIG) for the project. The total is unspecified at this hour.\n\"At this moment of recovery and rebuilding, Apple is doubling down on our commitment to US innovation and manufacturing with a generational investment reaching communities across all 50 states,\" Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, wrote in a statement. \"We're creating jobs in cutting-edge fields - from 5G to silicon engineering to artificial intelligence - investing in the next generation of innovative new businesses, and in all our work, building toward a greener and more equitable future.\"\nApple's announcement comes as the company plans to invest more than $430 billion and add 20,000 new jobs across the United States in the next five years.\n$100 Million Dollar Infrastructure Fund\nApple says it will also establish a $100 million fund to support schools and community initiatives in the Raleigh-Durham area and across the state. There will also be an over $110 million investment to fund infrastructure going toward broadband, roads and bridges, and public schools, in the 80 North Carolina counties with the greatest need.\nThe investments are expected to generate $1.5 billion in economic benefits annually for the state.\nBreaking down the economic impact of the Apple announcement\n\"By 2029, Apple's investment and job creation is expected to generate at least $1.5 billion annually for the state of North Carolina,\" said Dr. John Connaughton, UNC Charlotte's Belk College of Business.\nApple's Racial Justice and Equity Initiative\nApple's move into the Triangle brings it closer to the students of color the company has made recent strides to empower through racial justice efforts. Late last year, the company announced a $100 million dollar initiative to help dismantle systemic barriers and promote racial equality for people of color. Saint Augustine's University in Raleigh partnered with the tech company for a first-of-its-kind education hub for historically Black colleges and universities based in Atlanta. Monday's announcement has the potential to bring that partnership much closer to home.\n\"Our region (Triangle Area of North Carolina) is bursting with creative, innovative and problem-solving partnership opportunities between Apple and Saint Augustine's University,\" said SAU President Christine Johnson McPhail. \"We are excited about the opportunity to become a hub to build the capacity to promote pathways for more of our students and community residents to enter the STEM workforce.\"\nApple news could have effect on housing market: If you want to buy or sell a home, Triangle Realtor says 'do it now'\nWith 1,100 current employees in North Carolina, Apple's hub in RTP will more than triple the company's Tar Heel state footprint.\n\"The Research Triangle Park was the 2nd research park in the world and remains one of the largest and most successful. Transformational events have occurred during RTP's 61-year history; Apple's decision to undertake a leadership role in our community certain. \"The Research Triangle Foundation of NC, founder and administrator of Research Triangle Park, celebrates Apple's decision to become a leader among our 310 companies.\"\nApple doubles down on U.S. presence\nThe company announced Monday it's bolstering a previously announced investment by an additional 20% and adding another 20,000 new jobs.\nThe company said that its investment -- now increased to $430 billion -- comes as its contributions have \"significantly outpaced\" its original 2018 commitment of $350 billion to new facilities and the creation of 20,000 jobs. The fresh investment stretches across 9,000 companies in all 50 US states, supporting new technology, including 5G and silicon engineering.\nApple said that the 20,000 new jobs -- in addition to the 20,000 jobs Apple previously committed -- will be added over the next five years. They will be in Colorado, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington, New York, California and other states. The company had 147,000 employees as of September 2020.\nApple also pointed out that it's the \"largest taxpayer\" in the United States, paying more than $45 billion in domestic corporate income taxes in just the past five years. That topic has become a flashpoint for major corporations as the White House considers raising taxes on them for the first time in more than 25 years.\nNotably, Apple's massive investment comes as its suppliers making similar proclamations are flailing. Last week, Foxconn's plan for a massive electronics factory in Wisconsin has largely flatlined. The pledged investment of up to $10 billion to create as many as 13,000 jobs is not coming. Rather, it's creating fewer than 1,500 jobs and incentives package now totals only $80 million.\nCNN Wire contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Apple is launching a study into whether the Apple Watch can be used to detect respiratory illnesses such as coronavirus or flu, in partnership with the University of Washington and the Seattle Flu Study.\nApple initially announced the study at its Time Flies event in September last year, it but has only recently launched, as spotted by Apple Insider.\nThe goal of the study is to see if the information collected by the Apple Watch and iPhone can detect early signs of respiratory illnesses like COVID-19. If you are eligible and decide to participate, you will be provided an Apple Watch to wear. The watch will collect information about your health and activity. You will also be asked to answer simple survey questions in the Apple Research app on your iPhone about respiratory symptoms and lifestyle on a weekly and monthly basis. If you get sick during the study, you will be provided with a free, at-home nasal swab to be tested for COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses, and you will be asked to take some additional health measurements using your Apple Watch.\nThe study is expected to take \"up to six months\" and participants accepted into the program will be provided with an Apple Watch for research purposes, which they will be expected to wear \"throughout the study, both day and night.\" Enrolment is open now for individuals in the greater Seattle area who are age 22 or older and have an Apple iPhone 6s or newer.\nA previous independent study by Mount Sinai researchers found that an Apple Watch can effectively predict a positive COVID-19 diagnosis up to a week before current PCR-based nasal swab tests, which may be reinforced by the findings of this new study.\nPrevious independent Apple Watch studies have shown that the smartwatch's heart sensors may be able to detect early signs of diabetes and provide early warning signs of atrial fibrillation.",

        "body": "Renowned leaker l0vetodream said today that the upcoming iMac redesign will feature an even larger display than the current iMac lineup.\nApple currently sells iMacs in two sizes; a 21.5-inch model and a 27-inch model. The leaker suggests that the new iMac will feature a display that is Apple\u2019s biggest yet, thereby exceeding 27 inches. Perhaps Apple is looking to match the Apple Pro Display XDR and create a 32-inch all-in-one machine?\nThe new iMac is expected to feature a radical redesign, as the current iMac\u2019s industrial design dates back almost eight years with extremely large screen bezels and a beveled chassis.\nThe new iMac is expected to take design cues from the 2018 iPad Pro aesthetic with reduced bezels and flatter sides. In January, Bloomberg said the iMac will look similar to the Pro Display XDR.\nWe have heard persistent rumors that the small 21.5-inch iMac will get its screen upgraded to 24-inches as part of the redesign, resulting in a machine that is about the same physical size as the current iMac thanks to the assumed shrinking of display bezel. (Apple actually made 24-inch iMacs more than a decade ago, before the iMac switched to an aluminium enclosure).\nl0vetodream\u2019s tweet today suggests that the high-end iMac will also get a screen size increase, exceeding the current 27-inch size. Historically, 27-inches is as large as the iMac has ever been. However, the Apple Cinema Display was sold in a 30-inch size so that is a potential route here, as is matching the 32-inch screen found in the Pro Display XDR.\nThe new iMac lineup is expected to debut sometime in the next few months, featuring a next-generation Apple Silicon chip. We have already seen Apple discontinue the high end iMac Pro and stop selling many BTO-configurations of the 21.5-inch iMac, as it prepares for a product overhaul.",

        "body": "iOS 14 has brought several new privacy features, and there are more to come with App Tracking Transparency \u2014 which will let users opt out of being tracked by apps. As the launch of this new option approaches, Apple has begun to reject apps using third-party SDKs that collect user data without consent.\nDevelopers can implement some SDKs that help them track users by a method called \u201cdevice fingerprinting,\u201d which uses multiple attributes such as the device model, IP address, and other data to identify a person across the internet. Apps often use this data for deep analysis about their audience or to sell advertisements.\nWhile tracking the user is not exactly illegal, Apple wants to put an end to apps that do this without explicit consent. As noted by analyst Eric Seufert, the company is now rejecting any apps using the Adjust SDK, which is one of those SDKs that provides device fingerprinting.\nThere would be no problem for these developers if the Adjust SDK complied with Apple\u2019s new privacy guidelines, but this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. Seufert detailed to 9to5Mac that the Adjust SDK not only doesn\u2019t have an option for users to opt out of being tracked, but has also been suggesting alternatives for developers to continue tracking users once Apple enables App Tracking Transparency.\nPer a number of developers, Apple has begun rejecting app updates that include the Adjust SDK related to its collection of data used for device fingerprinting. \u2014 Eric Seufert (@eric_seufert) April 1, 2021\nWith App Tracking Transparency, developers will no longer be able to track users across the web and other apps without asking for permission first. If the user decides not to be tracked, the app will not be able to collect the advertising identifier (IDFA) from that device. The feature is part of iOS 14.5, which is expected to be released to all users this spring.\nThe changes in Apple\u2019s privacy guidelines have already upset some big companies like Facebook, whose main revenue comes from advertisements. More recently, former Facebook employees have detailed how the new privacy features in iOS 14 will affect the social network \u2014 and possibly other companies that collect such data.",

        "body": "Apple yesterday unveiled a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a Liquid Retina XDR display that uses mini-LED backlighting to achieve up to 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness and up to 1,600 nits of peak brightness. With over 10,000 mini\u2011LEDs grouped into more than 2,500 local dimming zones, the display also has an impressive 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio.\nApple has so far branded its mini-LED displays as \"XDR\" displays, short for \"Extreme Dynamic Range,\" and rumors suggest the iPad Pro won't be the only Apple device to feature the technology this year.\nTaiwanese research firm TrendForce today reported that Apple plans to launch new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with mini-LED displays in the second half of 2021, in line with previous reports. The notebooks are expected to be powered by an Apple silicon chip and feature a new design with the return of an SD card slot and HDMI port.\nThere is a lot of anticipation for the new high-end MacBook Pro models, as Apple will likely equip the notebooks with an improved iteration of its M1 chip, perhaps with M1X branding or something along those lines. Reputable sources like Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo have also claimed that the Touch Bar will be replaced with physical function keys, and that a MagSafe magnetic power cable will return.\nAs of this week, Apple has updated four Mac models with Apple silicon, including the iMac, 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini. Apple previously said that its transition away from Intel processors would be completed by around WWDC 2022.",

        "title": "Future iPhones may predict when a battery will run out, give early warning",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nAll iPhones already chart power usage over time; Apple wants to use that information to predict when low power will occur\nApple plans to have your iPhone predict far in advance if you're going to run out of charge today, and warn you in time to do something about it.\nJust as every iPhone runs out of battery power, so every iPhone has always had the ability to warn when that power is getting low. It's more complicated than the little icon and notifications would make it seem, but still it is a familiar experience of using an iPhone. And Apple wants to improve it.\n\"Smart advice to charge notification,\" is a newly-granted patent that is not concerned with prolonging battery life through some chemistry or physics. Instead, it's about accepting the fact we'll run out of battery power, and trying to minimize the inconvenience.\n\"Typically, when the battery level falls below a predetermined threshold value of remaining charge, then the electronic device notifies the user,\" says Apple, \"with a message such as 'battery low' or other visual and/or audible indicator of the remaining charge level.\"\nYou may not like that you have a low battery, but it's inevitable and the warning at least helps you. The iPhone going automatically into Low Power Mode helps even more, as it keeps you running longer by cutting out non-essential functions.\n\"[However, often] a 'battery low; indication that is based on a fixed threshold of charge remaining is not received in time for the user to take a corrective action,\" continues Apple. \"For example, if a user typically charges her smart phone at night, but forgets to do so on one occasion, receiving a 'battery low' indication just before leaving for work the next day does not leave the user time to charge her phone before work.\"\nWe've all done it. Apple wants to stop us getting into that situation again. And its new patent devotes over 12,000 words to just exactly how it can do that.\nFor all of this detail, though, the principle is simple. Future iPhones will figure out in advance when you're likely to run low on power, and tell you in enough time for you to do something about it.\nWe've already got iPhones offering different Siri Suggestions at different times of day, or smart widgets that surface what you're most likely to want to see depending on when and where you are. This would be similar, in how it would learn over time when you tend to charge your iPhone, and when you tend to use it most.\n\"A database of computing system activities can be generated as the computing system is used,\" says the patent. \"Activities can be based on sensor data, such as a location sensor, time of day, whether the computing system is in motion, and whether the charging system is currently plugged into a wall outlet.\"\nArmed with usage data that improves over time, the iPhone can have what Apple calls an \"'advice to charge' module\" which analyzes \"the state of charge information to determine when a user is likely to charge.\" Using that analysis, it can determine \"whether the energy storage device will have a level of charge remaining that is below a predetermined threshold amount before the next forecasted charging time.\"\nDetail from the patent showing a typical charging history that the iPhone will monitor\n\"A premise of this disclosure is that, for a given day of the week, a user's patterns in charging are very predictable over time,\" continues the patent. \"For example, on Monday through Friday, a user may charge her computing system when she arrives at work at 8:30 a.m., and then charge her computing system again before going to bed at about 10:00 p.m.\"\nThe patent then goes into detail over when an iPhone can track power usage, how long it keeps the data, and at what intervals it starts this predictive charging routine. There are factors such as location-awareness, too, and using an owner's Apple Watch to determine whether they are at home or work.\nAs with any Apple patent, the moment it describes anything regarding location-awareness, it also discusses privacy issues. So the \"location can be anonymized,\" it says.\nAside from privacy qualifications like this, the patent is focused on how \"a notification can be sent to the user if there is a high probability that the user is unlikely to make it until the next high probability charge time.\"\n\"For example,\" says Apple, \"if the computing system notifies a user to charge at a fixed value of 10% remaining charge, and it is determined that the user typically charges at 10:00 p.m., and it is now 10:00 p.m., and the energy storage device currently has 30% remaining charge, then the user will not receive a notification.\"\n\"However, if analysis of the current, and stored, state of charge information indicates that the user will not make it to their next high probability charge time without running out of energy,\" explains Apple, \"the computing device can display an advice to charge notification at 10:00 p.m., even though the current state of charge is greater than the fixed threshold of 10% remaining energy.\"\nSo it doesn't matter that you've got low power mode set to kick in at 10% and your charge is currently at a safe 30%. If your iPhone thinks you're not going to make it to when you normally plug it in to charge, it will warn you anyway.\nThat's as far as the patent goes. It is about determining the need for a notification and anything else that might follow \u2014 such as automatically entering Low Power Mode \u2014 is outside the scope of the patent.\nThis new patent is credited to four inventors, including Kartik Venkatraman, and Cyril De La Cropte De Chanterac. Their previous related work includes a patent on improving power management in devices.",

        "title": "Microsoft can\u2019t keep up with Apple\u2019s iPad anymore",
        "body": "It was 2010 when Steve Jobs introduced the iPad, a so-called \u201cthird device\u201d that sat comfortably between a smartphone and a laptop. Jobs said that in order for that to work, the product needed to be better at some things than its siblings. He used cases like reading as examples, and those use cases were a far cry from today's iPad Pro.\nIt was two years later that Microsoft introduced its own tablets, called Surface. In the beginning, there were two devices: The Surface RT and the Surface Pro, the former of which used an ARM processor and a version of Windows that supported it, while the Pro used an Intel chip and regular old Windows 8.\nCredits: Apple\nI can\u2019t help but think back to when these devices were first presented to the world, in light of last week's event when Apple announced that its tablet is getting the same processor as its MacBook Pro, along with similar memory configurations. Apple had come along with this idea for a third device, and Microsoft was the one that was trying to cram a computer into a tablet that would be your only device. Apple\u2019s strategy has evolved over time, but Microsoft\u2019s hasn\u2019t too much.\nMicrosoft clings to its legacy software\nMicrosoft used the opposite strategy as Apple, and it\u2019s catching up to the Redmond company. That original iPad ran iOS \u2014 a bigger version of the operating system on iPhones \u2014 which is now iPadOS. The Cupertino firm has spent over a decade taking a modern, mobile platform and building it up to be more feature-complete for productivity. Meanwhile, Microsoft has been working hard to get its legacy desktop operating system to work on tablets. Apple has been building up while Microsoft is trying to scale down.\nFor a long time, it worked out too. Back in 2014 when the freshly redesigned Surface Pro 3 came out, a consumer who was deciding to replace a laptop with either a new one or one of those fancy new tablets might have settled on a Surface, hoping to get the best of both worlds. This was shortly after the 2013 iPad Air announcement when Tim Cook said of Microsoft, \u201cOur competition is different. They\u2019re confused. They chased after netbooks. Now they\u2019re trying to make PCs into tablets and tablets into PCs.\u201d\nAt the time, Cook was talking about Windows 8, a version of the OS that will go down in infamy. It had separate touch-centric and desktop environments that worked completely differently from each other. On top of that, there was little instruction on how to use the radically redesigned operating system. Windows RT was even worse because it looked exactly like Windows 8, including the desktop environment, but it didn\u2019t have support for desktop apps.\nMicrosoft had a different vision than Apple did\nIndeed, back then, Microsoft truly thought that the future of computing was tablets and touchscreens, and it went all-in. Windows 10 was the answer that was meant to fix these issues, and the company has been trying to get tablet mode right ever since. For example, there are all kinds of inconsistencies in the UI. That's partially because tapping the screen can do different things. If you\u2019re using a classic desktop app, a UWP app, or one of the many other kinds of apps found on Windows, you can get different results.\nWith a Surface Pro, it wasn\u2019t particularly good at being a tablet, but the key advantage was that that you could always run full desktop apps on it. It was a real computer. The iPad, on the other hand, long held a reputation for being a consumption device, even a Kindle competitor in its early years. Microsoft\u2019s leg up on the iPad was always that you can do real work on the Surface.\nThis continued when the first iPad Pro was introduced in 2015. Apple added an attachable keyboard and Pencil support. Naturally, at the time, it simply looked like the company was copying Microsoft Surface, except with a more limited operating system.\niPadOS spawns from a modern operating system\nApple started out the iPad\u2019s life with a somewhat simple operating system that at the very least, was comfortable to use on a tablet. And it worked. It did what it was supposed to do, and it got better over time. When iOS 13 was announced at WWDC 2019, Apple rebranded the iPad variant of the operating system to iPadOS.\nCredits: Apple\nToday, iPadOS supports mouse and trackpad input, and Apple supports universal apps that can run across iPhone, iPad, and macOS. Even apps like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator are available on iPad now. On macOS, the company\u2019s ARM processors can emulate Intel apps, and of course, on iPadOS, it never had to.\nApple has done something that Microsoft has tried many times to do: It made ARM work. The plan was there all along. It started building custom processors in its iPhones and later iPads. Eventually, they got to be so powerful that they showed up in Macs.\nOh, and Apple is using modern hardware in the iPad Pro too\nNow, Apple put an M1 chipset in an iPad Pro. Meanwhile, Microsoft currently has an Intel-powered Surface Pro 7 that hasn\u2019t had a significant visual refresh in about four generations. If we\u2019re putting the two head-to-head, Apple has caught up to Microsoft. If you disagree, that\u2019s fine too. Because if not, Apple will catch up next year, or the year after that. The fact is that Apple is moving forward with a modern operating system and Microsoft is mostly stagnant, depending on how its upcoming Windows 10X bet plays out.\nHere are some plain numbers, though. Rendering a two-minute, 13-second video in Premiere Pro took three minutes and 13 seconds on a 13-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 processor. On a Razer Book 13 with Intel\u2019s 11th-generation processors, it took four minutes even. And that\u2019s just video rendering times when comparing the two platforms.\nApple Macbook Pro 13. Credits: Rich Woods\nOn top of that, the MacBook Pro had half the RAM that the Razer Book did in that test. Part of why that\u2019s OK is because the memory is just better. Apple uses something called unified high-bandwidth memory (HBM) architecture, which is available to the whole chipset. The memory is on the chipset, and it can be accessed by the CPU, the GPU, and Apple\u2019s Neural Engine, rather than each of those having their own memory and having to move that data around.\nWe\u2019re not talking about the usual 10% or 15% gen-over-gen improvement on the new iPad Pro. Apple is promising a 50% CPU performance boost over the previous model with the octa-core CPU in the M1, and the octa-core GPU offers a 40% increase in graphics performance. There\u2019s also a 16-core Neural Engine for AI and machine learning tasks.\nTo put it in simpler terms, this hardware is just incredible. Apple has taken its iPad to a level that competitors like Microsoft can\u2019t reach. That\u2019s what happens when you own the full stack; you can control every little bit of the hardware and software to make the best product.\nIt\u2019s a different wheelhouse at this point\nThe other fact is that Microsoft really doesn\u2019t care as much. Surface is becoming more and more a business brand. What businesses want from a product is simple. They want more of the same. They want Windows 10 because it\u2019s what they\u2019ve standardized on for years, and they want a new Surface Pro in the same chassis because it will fit all of their docks and peripherals.\nThe last time the display on the Surface Pro changed was in 2015 with the Surface Pro 4; the size was increased from 12 to 12.3 inches. It\u2019s remained the same since, and if you look at a Surface Pro today, it definitely looks like something designed in 2015.\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 7. Credits: Rich Woods.\nMeanwhile, Apple just added Thunderbolt to the iPad Pro. At the same time, Microsoft is quite literally the only PC OEM not to include it in its premium devices. The Cupertino firm is also continuing to trim down its bezel sizes, ditching the Home button in recent years. The iPad Pro also got a redesign back in 2018, when Apple gave it flat edges, kicking off the modern Apple design trend.\nIf you\u2019re a Microsoft fan, your instinct is probably to reject the notion that the lowly tablet known as the iPad has caught up to Surface, or that iPadOS has caught up to Windows when it comes to modern devices. You\u2019ll probably point out the things that are still missing, the best examples of which are probably Xcode and Final Cut Pro. Yes, you can indeed run full Visual Studio and do software development on a Surface Pro. But you still can't on an iPad. There\u2019s nothing holding Apple back from doing any of that anymore though. The iPad Pro has the same chipset as the 13-inch MacBook Pro now.\nBut wait, there\u2019s also Windows 10X\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Microsoft does have a modern operating system in the pipeline called Windows 10X. Sadly, we\u2019ll just sort of have to wait and see on that one. It was originally announced as an OS for dual-screen devices, such as Microsoft\u2019s own Surface Neo. Eventually, the Surface Neo was delayed indefinitely. It was announced that Windows 10X would come to single-screen devices first, particularly entry-level ones. From everything we\u2019ve heard, Windows 10X sounds more like a Chrome OS competitor than an iPadOS competitor.\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold. Credits: Rich Woods.\nWindows 10X is something completely new, unlike other attempts by Microsoft to lock down Windows such as Windows RT or Windows 10 S. The Redmond company is starting fresh with its new OS. It's shedding legacy components while focusing on certain features that it thinks are staples of a modern operating system. On Windows 10X, you won\u2019t find things like Hyper-V virtualization, Internet Explorer, the Windows Subsystem for Linux, and most notably, it\u2019s not going to ship with Win32 app support.\nThat means that you\u2019ll only be able to run apps from the Microsoft Store. And for web browsing, you\u2019ll be stuck with Edge. The original promise was to run Win32 apps in containers so they can't affect the rest of the system. But being that this will use low-end hardware, some sort of cloud virtualization solution might be the way forward.\nA more modern Windows\nAnd as for the features that Microsoft considers to be part of a modern OS, the firm actually outlined them back in 2019, before it even announced Windows 10X. For example, Microsoft thinks that a modern operating system should have seamless updates, such as how Chrome OS updates in the background with minimal downtime. It should also be secure, always connected through Wi-Fi or cellular, support a variety of form factors, and more.\nEarly look at the start menu of Windows 10X. Credits: Zac Bowden.\nOf course, there\u2019s also a more modern UI. Windows 10X is the tablet mode that Surface users have dreamed of since Windows 10 came out. There are no more Live Tiles. They\u2019ve been replaced by a Start Menu that floats in the middle of the screen. You can control it with gestures too, rather than having to tap the big X in the corner to close an app.\nUnfortunately, Windows 10X might never even show up in a Surface Pro. The new OS is a Chrome OS competitor, and Microsoft is gearing it towards the educational market. If we do see Windows 10X in a Surface, it will start out in a device like the Surface Go. As it stands right now, the OS still isn\u2019t ready, and we\u2019re expecting to hear more about it later this year.\nWindows 10X is just Microsoft\u2019s latest attempt to shed legacy components and build a modern operating system, as its competitors Apple and Google have managed to do. Unfortunately for the Redmond firm, its competitors have been doing this for a while now. Apple's iPadOS has been iterated on every year since 2007. The hardware has gotten better too.\nMicrosoft can't keep up with the iPad Pro anymore\nMicrosoft has all but lost this war, just like it did with phones, and it did so in a similar way. Apple built a brand-new operating system and improved upon it year after year after year. On top of that, it\u2019s improved upon its hardware in a way that\u2019s unparalleled among its competitors. It started designing its own silicon early on, so it owns the full stack. It wasn\u2019t long after the first iPad Pro came out before people started noticing that it could do certain things better than a MacBook could.\nThat\u2019s actually not the case anymore though, because the iPad Pro now has the same processor as a MacBook or even an iMac. You can configure it with up to 16GB of RAM and 2TB of storage, similar to any computer. Indeed, the hardware absolutely makes the iPad Pro one of the best computers on the market; it\u2019s just using a modern OS, which you won\u2019t find in any Surface.\nSo, the iPad Pro has a more modern operating system and better hardware. The last thing is price, and indeed, a Surface Pro 7\u2019s entry point is $50 cheaper than the 11-inch iPad Pro. Unfortunately, that Surface Pro 7 comes with a Core i3, 4GB RAM, and 128GB storage. That base model iPad Pro comes with 8GB RAM, 128GB storage, and of course, the custom M1 processor for $799. It\u2019s hard to argue why anyone should get a Surface Pro 7 when Apple has accomplished what it has, and at a particularly low price point.",

You can get all the details on Apple.com.\" The event will likely be a pre-recorded affair without media in attendance and should be live-streamed on Apple's website and YouTube channel.\n\u200cSiri\u200c is not providing the information in all instances and will in some cases simply refer you to Apple's website for information on events, but multiple MacRumors editors and readers have seen the premature information across Apple devices including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and HomePod.\nApple typically sends out press invitations for its digital events around a week before the actual event, so it seems likely that Apple will confirm the event later today. Bloomberg has reported that Apple plans to showcase a brand new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with new mini-LED display technology in the middle of this month.\nUpdate: Apple has now officially announced the April 20 event.",

        "title": "Review: using Apple\u2019s AirTag for tracking luggage and checked baggage",
        "body": "When Apple unveiled its new AirTag tracker, my thoughts immediately went to how useful this button-sized device could be for frequent flyers travelling with checked luggage.\nAfter all, using the AirTag to keep tabs on everyday items ranging from backpacks and suitcases to expensive jackets, an umbrella, purse or your car keys is a given. If you lose it, an AirTag can track it and help you find it again.\nBut we\u2019ve all stood around airport luggage carousels, waiting for bags to be disgorged from the chute and then make their way along that snaking conveyor belt to wherever we\u2019re standing.\nCould Apple\u2019s newest gadget be the hottest travel accessory since noise-cancelling headphones?\nExecutive Traveller headed to the airport with AirTagged luggage in tow to find out.\nApple AirTag 101\nIf you\u2019re not up to speed on the Apple AirTag, here\u2019s a quick recap.\nThe size of a 20c piece and the shape of a coat button, AirTags are wireless gizmos which can be attached to anything you\u2019re likely to temporarily misplace, leave behind or full-on lose.\nPowered by a replaceable CR2032 coin battery, each AirTag is constantly broadcasting a silent, sonar-like Bluetooth ping.\n(There\u2019s no \u2018off\u2019 switch: the AirTag springs to life as soon as you insert the battery, which lasts for a year and alerts you when it\u2019s running low.)\nIf an AirTag is within Bluetooth range of your iPhone, iPad or even Apple laptop or desktop \u2013 which usually means the AirTag is somewhere in your house \u2013 its location will appear in Apple\u2019s Find My software (which can already be used to locate iPhones, iPads, AirPods and what-not) to help you find it.\nIn fact, if you\u2019ve got an iPhone 11 or 12 series and are even closer to your missing item (what\u2019s known in Hide and Seek as \u2018getting warm\u2019), your iPhone will switch to Precision Finding mode and guide you to the AirTag by accurately reporting both distance and direction.\nThis relies on Ultra Wideband technology, enabled by these iPhones and the AirTags both containing Apple\u2019s special U1 microchip. It\u2019s dead clever stuff.\nWhat if your gear has wandered much further afield?\nAny of the billion-plus other devices in Apple\u2019s cloud-based Find My network \u2013 other people\u2019s iPhones, iPads etc \u2013 can pick up the Bluetooth signal from any nearby AirTag and privately relay its location back to the owner.\nBecause the Find My software is baked into Apple\u2019s operating systems and usually always active, this happens automatically: Apple is, in effect, crowd-sourcing an ever-vigilant global search party.\nYou can even flag an AirTagged item as \u2018lost\u2019 so that you get a location alert when it surfaces while the AirTag itself can communicate a contact phone number and message to any Apple user or even Android smartphone user (using NFC) who stumbles upon it.\nAirTags are predictably sleek \u2013 shiny stainless steel on one side, glossy white on the other (this surface can be customised with laser-etching) and not outrageously priced, at $45 each or $149 for a pack of four, although if you want to attach the AirTag to something you\u2019ll need a cost-extra key ring, loop strap or holder (starting at $20).\nThe AirTag goes head-to-head with similar trackers such as Tile and Samsung\u2019s SmartTag, but it\u2019s an obvious choice for anybody already in the Apple ecosystem, and cleverly taps into the massive size of the Apple device market.\nUsing Apple\u2019s AirTag for airline luggage\nNow let\u2019s get down to the travel-centric nitty-gritty.\nYou\u2019re off on yet another flight \u2013 hopefully a holiday, although it\u2019s probably work \u2013 and you decide to attach an Apple AirTag to each checked bag.\nPut a new AirTag next to your iPhone and it\u2019s automatically and elegantly paired to your iPhone (and your Apple iCloud account, which is the backbone of the Find My network), just like AirPods.\nTo describe what the AirTag is tracking, choose from a list of suggested names \u2013 each accompanied by a preset icon \u2013 or give it a unique name and choose an icon to suit.\n(Of course, you can easily change an AirTag\u2019s name and icon if you need to move it from one device to the another.)\nAttach that AirTag to your luggage, head to the airport and drop off your checked bags as usual.\nObvious question #1: the AirTag is continually transmitting little Bluetooth burps, but don\u2019t airlines want Bluetooth gadgets disabled during flight?\nOther luggage trackers such as Tile have been doing the same thing for years, while passengers have wireless Bluetooth headphones and earphones, so this is really not an issue.\nAlso worth noting: while airlines have banned rechargeable lithium-ion battery packs from checked luggage (including so-called \u2018smart luggage\u2019), this doesn\u2019t apply to the tiny single-use lithium CR2032 cells. Besides which, they\u2019re already in millions of Tiles and key fobs sitting in cargo holds.\nPutting Apple\u2019s AirTag to the test\nHere, then, is the scenario: you step off your flight and head to a carousel that\u2019s already packed with luggage, with more bags being disgorged by the minute.\nBut this time your bag has had a high-tech upgrade, courtesy of the AirTag dangling from the handle or more subtly snugged into a side pocket.\nInstead of trying to peer over and through the crowd, watching for your luggage to appear, you just stand back \u2013 maybe even grab a seat \u2013 launch your iPhone\u2019s Find My app and wait for your AirTagged bag to make its presence known.\nHere\u2019s the bad news: having thoroughly tested the AirTag at an airport, we can report this is not what happens. In this scenario, Apple\u2019s AirTag simply doesn\u2019t work.\nThe first issue is that the AirTag\u2019s live here-I-am tracking isn\u2019t intended for objects that are moving, unless they\u2019re doing so at the most leisurely pace.\nAnd while the average airport luggage belt is no threat to Usain Bolt, it runs too fast for the AirTag\u2019s virtual hand-waving to be properly identified by your iPhone.\n(During my AirTag media briefing earlier in the week, Apple had suggested this might be the case: although to its credit the Find My app was aware the luggage was moving.)\nEven with an iPhone 12 to take advantage of Precision Finding, the only time the AirTagged bag appeared on my screen while being carried along the belt was when it was literally right in front of me.\nOf course, if you\u2019re standing at the edge of the luggage belt then you\u2019ll see your bag before anything else; and if you\u2019re stuck behind a three-people deep throng of fellow travellers, you may still spy the bag but the iPhone certainly won\u2019t see it.\nWhat about using all that congestion in your favour? While those plane-loads of passengers are catching up with email and texts and social media on their iPhones, can their combined input to Apple\u2019s Find My network at least show if your bag\u2019s on the carousel?\nAgain, no. Pinpointing very specific locations on the Find My screen relies on Apple Maps, which simply doesn\u2019t drill down to such a granular level, and certainly not deep inside an airport terminal.\nWhat the AirTag might be able to do \u2013 if Apple's willing to entertain this in a future software update \u2013 would be to send a notification to your iPhone once it comes within Bluetooth range, such as when your bag lands on the carousel.\nThis is less complicated than actual device tracking but would still be immensely useful for travellers.\nWhere the AirTag works like a travel charm\nSo does this mean that Apple\u2019s AirTag is a total fail for the frequent flyer? Far from it.\nAirTags have a clear application to help find anything you might travel with but also risk leaving behind or losing: your passport wallet, a briefcase or jacket, even the carry case where your noise-cancelling headphones reside when not in use (there\u2019s a reason noise-cancelling cans are among the most numerous items when airports auction off their lost property).\nAnd there are other times when an AirTag will come to the rescue of your checked luggage.\nDuring peak periods, airport staff can move bags from one flight \u2013 even if it\u2019s only recently landed \u2013 off the luggage belt as bags from another flight pour in. You finally get through the customs and immigration checkpoint, reach the carousel and waste a half-hour waiting to see your bag on the belt before discovering it\u2019s been sitting in that corral over there.\nThere\u2019s a good chance the Find My app \u2013 especially with Precision Finding \u2013 could help show where your bag really is, given that it\u2019s stationary rather than on a moving belt.\nIn our testing, the iPhone 12 identified and gave clear directions to an AirTagged bag almost 10 metres away (putting the AirTag inside the bag instead of on the external strap made no discernible difference to the range or accuracy of tracking).\nLikewise, when a large bag checked in for your flight is unexpectedly directed to the oversized baggage office instead of coming out on the luggage belt, an AirTag could save you plenty of time and frustration.\nAnother example: a colleague recounted how, on arriving on a flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, her bag failed to appear on the belt, and she was eventually told her bag was in fact among many which were not loaded at LAX.\nThat turned out not be the case \u2013 all the bags had made it to Sydney Airport \u2013 and a quick check of the Find My app would have shown they were somewhere in the vicinity rather than 12,000km away.\nThe take-away? While Apple\u2019s AirTags won\u2019t solve all of your baggage belt blues, they\u2019re still going to find a very welcome place in your travel kit.",

        "title": "Facebook Doesn't Want to Give Apple Requested Documents in Epic v. Apple Fight",
        "body": "Facebook and Apple are squabbling over document requests in the ongoing Epic v. Apple legal battle, according to a new discovery letter filed with the court today. Facebook is involved because Facebook executive Vivek Sharma is set to testify on behalf of Epic.\nApple wants a \"limited set of documents\" that are needed for a fair cross examination of Sharma, who plans to testify about Apple's restrictions on iOS app distribution, the App Store process, and Facebook's interactions with Apple, but Facebook does not want to produce the documents that Apple is asking for.\nThere are apparently more than 17,000 documents related to Sharma that Apple feels are relevant in the case, but Facebook says that producing tens of thousands of documents is an \"untimely, unfair, and unjustified request to redo fact discovery.\" Facebook has already provided Apple with more than 1,600 documents, including 200 involving Sharma, but Apple does not believe that is sufficient.\nAccording to Apple, Facebook has been continually ignoring requests for documents and using delaying tactics. Apple says it served multiple subpoenas to Facebook starting in December and met with Facebook several times to narrow the scope of the requests, but Facebook has refused to produce many of the documents in question.\nApple was fed up with Facebook and ultimately agreed not to pursue additional documents if no Facebook executives testified, but Epic added Sharma to its witness list, and Apple again wants the documents.\nDespite Facebook's knowledge of the time constraints in this action, it stalled for five days purportedly because \"there is unavoidable technical processing time baked in to\" investigating the burden of production, and finally admitted on March 29 it did not intend to produce more documents.\nFacebook claims that Apple waited to ask for the documents after the discovery period had closed (and before Apple confirmed Sharma would be a witness), making the timing of the request \"improper.\" Facebook also claims that Apple is asking for additional unrelated documents pertaining to iOS 14 and Facebook's response to App Tracking Transparency that are irrelevant to the case.\nIf Apple believed that production was insufficient in any way, it had every opportunity to move to compel within 7 days of the close of discovery as required by the Court's Rules. Apple chose not to, making this motion untimely. Instead, claiming surprise by Epic's disclosure of Mr. Sharma as a trial witness--even though Epic's complaint quoted him by name--Apple now demands that Facebook review and produce an enormous number of additional documents.\nApple is asking the court to order Facebook to comply with Apple's request for Facebook's documents so that \"Apple has a fair opportunity to cross examine the newly-disclosed trial witness.\" Facebook argues that it should not be compelled to \"review tens of thousands more documents because Apple wants to go fishing for some theoretical additional cross material,\" and therefore the court should deny the request.\nUpdate: The court has denied Apple's request to compel Facebook to produce additional documents, calling it \"untimely\" and ruling in favor of Facebook. The judge said that Apple could, however, raise a motion to have Vivek Sharma dismissed as a witness if Epic failed to disclose him in a timely manner.",
