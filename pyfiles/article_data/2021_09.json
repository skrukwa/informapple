        "body": "Dear Team,\nIt was great to connect with you at the global employee meeting on Friday. There was much to celebrate, from our remarkable new product line-up to our values driven work around climate change, racial equity, and privacy. It was a good opportunity to reflect on our many accomplishments and to have a discussion about what\u2019s been on your mind.\nI\u2019m writing today because I\u2019ve heard from so many of you were were incredibly frustrated to see the contents of the meeting leak to reporters. This comes after a product launch in which most of the details of our announcements were also leaked to the press.\nI want you to know that I share your frustration. These opportunities to connect as a team are really important. But they only work if we can trust that the content will stay within Apple. I want to reassure you that we are doing everything in our power to identify those who leaked. As you know, we do not tolerate disclosures of confidential information, whether it\u2019s product IP or the details of a confidential meeting. We know that the leakers constitute a small number of people. We also know that people who leak confidential information do not belong here.\nAs we look forward, I want to thank you for all you\u2019ve done to make our products a reality and all you will do to get them into customers\u2019 hands. Yesterday we released iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and watchOS 8, and Friday marks the moment when we share some of our incredible new products with the world. There\u2019s nothing better than that. We\u2019ll continue to measure our contributions in the lives we change, the connections we foster, and the work we do to leave the world a better place.\nThank you,\nTim",

        "title": "Apple delays rollout of CSAM detection feature, commits to making improvements",
        "body": "Last month, Apple announced a handful of new child safety features that proved to be controversial, including CSAM detection for iCloud Photos. Now, Apple has said they will \u201ctake additional time\u201d to refine the features before launching to the public.\nIn a statement to 9to5Mac, Apple said:\n\u201cLast month we announced plans for features intended to help protect children from predators who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them, and limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material. Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.\u201d\nApple\u2019s new child safety features were set to launch as part of updates to iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey later this year. There is now no word on when the company plans to roll out the features. Apple\u2019s statement today does not provide any details on what changes the company could make to improve the system.\nAs a refresher, here\u2019s the basics of how the CSAM detection system would work as currently designed:\nApple\u2019s method of detecting known CSAM is designed with user privacy in mind. Instead of scanning images in the cloud, the system performs on-device matching using a database of known CSAM image hashes provided by NCMEC and other child safety organizations. Apple further transforms this database into an unreadable set of hashes that is securely stored on users\u2019 devices. Before an image is stored in iCloud Photos, an on-device matching process is performed for that image against the known CSAM hashes. This matching process is powered by a cryptographic technology called private set intersection, which determines if there is a match without revealing the result. The device creates a cryptographic safety voucher that encodes the match result along with additional encrypted data about the image. This voucher is uploaded to iCloud Photos along with the image.\nUpon announcement, the new CSAM detection technology received quite a bit of pushback and criticism from privacy advocates. Apple, however, doubled down on the feature multiple times, and said that its implementation would actually be more privacy-preserving than technology used by other companies like Google and Facebook.\nIt was also revealed through this process that Apple already scans iCloud Mail for CSAM, with the expansion applying to iCloud Photos.\nOther child safety features announced by Apple last month, and also now delayed, include communications safety features in Messages and updated knowledge information for Siri and Search.\nWhat do you make of Apple\u2019s decision to delay the rollout of its new child safety features? Is it the right decision, or should the company have stuck to its initial plan?",

        "body": "Apple announced today that it would \u201ctake additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements\u201d to a program that will weaken privacy and security on iPhones and other products. EFF is pleased Apple is now listening to the concerns of customers, researchers, civil liberties organizations, human rights activists, LGBTQ people, youth representatives, and other groups, about the dangers posed by its phone scanning tools. But the company must go further than just listening, and drop its plans to put a backdoor into its encryption entirely.\nJOIN THE NATIONWIDE PROTEST\nTELL APPLE: DON'T SCAN OUR PHONES\nThe features Apple announced a month ago, intending to help protect children, would create an infrastructure that is all too easy to redirect to greater surveillance and censorship. These features would create an enormous danger to iPhone users\u2019 privacy and security, offering authoritarian governments a new mass surveillance system to spy on citizens. They also put already vulnerable kids at risk, especially LGBTQ youth, and create serious potential for danger to children in abusive households.\nThe responses to Apple\u2019s plans have been damning: over 90 organizations across the globe have urged the company not to implement them, for fear that they would lead to the censoring of protected speech, threaten the privacy and security of people around the world, and have disastrous consequences for many children. This week, EFF\u2019s petition to Apple demanding they abandon their plans reached 25,000 signatures. This is in addition to other petitions by groups such as Fight for the Future and OpenMedia, totaling well over 50,000 signatures. The enormous coalition that has spoken out will continue to demand that user phones\u2014both their messages and their photos\u2014be protected, and that the company maintain its promise to provide real privacy to its users.\nFurther Reading:",

        "body": "Despite a smaller notch, the iPhone 13 lineup will not show users their battery percentage in the status bar, or at least, not by default, according to the \u200ciPhone 13\u200c simulator embedded within Xcode.\nThe entire \u200ciPhone 13\u200c series features a smaller notch, allowing for more area to display content. While many customers may have hoped that a smaller notch would lead Apple to show the battery percentage in the status bar, that doesn't seem to be the case, at least for now.\nAs noted on Twitter, the Xcode 13 simulator for the \u200ciPhone 13\u200c Pro Max shows the status bar without a battery percentage, despite ample room to shift the signal and Wi-Fi bars to the left. While the simulator in the release candidate of Xcode 13, released after yesterday's event, shows no battery percentage, Apple may offer it as an option within Settings.\nAccording to the Xcode Simulator, even though there\u2019s enough space on iPhone 13 Pro Max, it still doesn\u2019t show the battery percentage #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/TOc7mz48EL \u2014 Apple Software Updates (@AppleSWUpdates) September 14, 2021\nApple is unlikely to place the battery percentage in the status bar with no way for users to turn it off. With older iPhones that feature no notch, Apple includes an option within settings to toggle the percentage on or off, and a similar play could be in-store with the \u200ciPhone 13\u200c. Although it's worth noting that none of the \u200ciPhone 13\u200c or updated iOS 15 marketing images depict that as a possibility.\nThe \u200ciPhone 13\u200c and \u200ciPhone 13\u200c Pro will begin shipping to customers on Friday, September 24, but we do expect reviews and hands-on impressions of the devices to be released before that. Those reviews and impressions will give us a definitive answer on whether Apple will finally allow customers to show their battery percentage in the status bar, rather than having to drag down on the right corner of the screen.",

        "title": "Apple announces first states to adopt driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet",
        "body": "September 1, 2021\nPRESS RELEASE\nApple announces first states signed up to adopt driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet\nArizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah are among the first states to bring state IDs and driver\u2019s licenses in Wallet to their residents\nCUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced that it is working with several states across the country, which will roll out the ability for their residents to seamlessly and securely add their driver\u2019s license or state ID to Wallet on their iPhone and Apple Watch. Arizona and Georgia will be the first states to introduce this new innovation to their residents, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah to follow. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will enable select airport security checkpoints and lanes in participating airports as the first locations customers can use their driver\u2019s license or state ID in Wallet. Built with privacy at the forefront, Wallet provides a more secure and convenient way for customers to present their driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs on iPhone or Apple Watch.\n\u201cThe addition of driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs to Apple Wallet is an important step in our vision of replacing the physical wallet with a secure and easy-to-use mobile wallet,\u201d said Jennifer Bailey, Apple\u2019s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. \u201cWe are excited that the TSA and so many states are already on board to help bring this to life for travelers across the country using only their iPhone and Apple Watch, and we are already in discussions with many more states as we\u2019re working to offer this nationwide in the future.\u201d\n\u201cThis new and innovative mobile driver\u2019s license and state ID initiative with Apple and states around the country will enable a more seamless airport security screening experience for travelers,\u201d said David Pekoske, TSA Administrator. \u201cThis initiative marks a major milestone by TSA to provide an additional level of convenience for the traveler by enabling more opportunities for touchless TSA airport security screening.\u201d\nSeamless and Secure Experience\nDriver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet will provide an easy, fast, and more secure way for people to present their driver\u2019s license or state ID using their iPhone or Apple Watch. Once a participating state begins offering this capability to its residents, customers will be able to add their driver\u2019s license or state ID to Wallet and simply tap their iPhone or Apple Watch to present it to the TSA, without taking out their physical card or handing over their device.\nAdding a driver\u2019s license or state ID to Wallet: Similar to how customers add new credit cards and transit passes to Wallet today, they can simply tap the + button at the top of the screen in Wallet on their iPhone to begin adding their license or ID. If the user has an Apple Watch paired to their iPhone, they will be prompted to also add their ID or driver\u2019s license to their Wallet app on their Apple Watch. The customer will then be asked to use their iPhone to scan their physical driver\u2019s license or state ID card and take a selfie, which will be securely provided to the issuing state for verification. As an additional security step, users will also be prompted to complete a series of facial and head movements during the setup process. Once verified by the issuing state, the customer\u2019s ID or driver\u2019s license will be added to Wallet.\nPresenting a driver\u2019s license or state ID to TSA: Once added to Wallet, customers can present their driver\u2019s license or state ID to the TSA by simply tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch at the identity reader. Upon tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch, customers will see a prompt on their device displaying the specific information being requested by the TSA. Only after authorizing with Face ID or Touch ID is the requested identity information released from their device, which ensures that just the required information is shared and only the person who added the driver\u2019s license or state ID to the device can present it. Users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device to present their ID.\nSecurity and Privacy\nWallet provides a convenient and more secure way to present driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs, while offering superior security and privacy over a physical wallet.\nApple and the issuing states do not know when or where users present their IDs.\nDriver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet take full advantage of the privacy and security built into iPhone and Apple Watch. Customers\u2019 identity data is encrypted and protected against tampering and theft. Biometric authentication using Face ID and Touch ID ensures that only the person who added the ID to the device can view or present their ID or license in Wallet.\nDriver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet are only presented digitally through encrypted communication directly between the device and the identity reader, so users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device.\nIf a user misplaces their iPhone or Apple Watch, they can use the Find My app to lock their device and help locate it, or remotely erase a device.\nApple\u2019s mobile ID implementation supports the ISO 18013-5 mDL (mobile driver\u2019s license) standard which Apple has played an active role in the development of, and which sets clear guidelines for the industry around protecting consumers\u2019 privacy when presenting an ID or driver\u2019s license through a mobile device.\nStates Across the Country See Benefits of IDs in Wallet\nStates across the country are looking forward to the superior security and convenience that driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet provide to them and their users.\n\u201cArizona is at the leading edge of states making mobile IDs available to the public, and we are pleased to work with Apple and give Arizonans the choice, convenience, and security of adding their driver\u2019s license to their Apple Wallet,\u201d said Eric Jorgensen, director of the Arizona Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Division. \u201cBeyond being innovative and exciting, a digital version of a driver\u2019s license offers increased security and privacy for our residents, making it something everyone should consider.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring a new addition to our state\u2019s modernization efforts that will make our residents\u2019 lives easier, and keep their identities secure through the use of mobile driver\u2019s licenses in Apple Wallet,\u201d said Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to be one of the first states working with Apple to deploy driver\u2019s licenses and state identification cards in Apple Wallet, and we\u2019re looking forward to taking the next steps to make sure this new feature benefits our residents.\u201d\n\u201cGeorgia is a national leader when it comes to the safety and security of its driver and identity credentialing process, with more than 99 percent of Georgians REAL ID compliant, and the state of Georgia is equally as committed to safety and security through our mobile driver\u2019s licensing (mDL) efforts with Apple,\u201d said Spencer R. Moore, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Driver Services. \u201cTogether, we will deliver customer convenience through touchless identity verification and enhanced security and privacy protection through technology. We are honored to work with Apple as an initial adopter for such a revolutionary customer experience. A state-issued credential has become the standard for which institutions of all sectors use as a trusted source of identity proofing.

        "body": "Apple is rumored to be in Asia visiting Toyota as it prepares to lay the supplier groundwork to mass produce a branded car by 2024, according to a new report by DigiTimes.\nApple representatives were said to have met with South Korea's SK Group and LG Electronics last month to discuss Apple Car development, and now Japan's Toyota is being touted as its next potential destination.\nApple has been working on a car-related project since at least 2014, and at one stage it looked as if the company was scaling back to focus on autonomous vehicle software. However, following several changes in management and hiring, Apple is now believed to be focused on building a car for consumers.\nBut to do that, the company needs to tap into a whole new supply chain. Apple is expected to rely on a manufacturing partner to build the vehicles, and though it wants to make EV batteries in the United States, it may be seeking partnerships with established vehicle makers like Toyota to do so.\nReuters has previously reported that Apple is developing a new battery design that has the potential to \"radically\" reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle's range.\nOne person who spoke to Reuters described Apple's \"monocle\" battery technology as \"next level\" and said that it's similar to \"the first time you saw the iPhone.\"\nReuters' reporting claimed that Apple is aiming to begin production on an Apple-branded self-driving vehicle starting in 2024, so DigiTimes' focus on that date isn't necessarily a shot in the dark. However, delays caused by the ongoing global health crisis or current chip shortage could always push production to 2025 or beyond.",

        "body": "Smart devices can come in handy in times of need.\nA 24-year-old motorcyclist's smart watch called for help after he got into an accident.\nMotorcyclist passed out after colliding with a van\nThe motorcyclist, named Muhammad Fitri, fell off his bike after colliding with a van at Ang Mo Kio.\nWhile lying on the ground, he saw the vehicle drive off before losing consciousness, he told Chinese daily Lianhe Wanbao.\nThe accident happened at the junction of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 and Ang Mo Kio Street 31 on Sep. 25 evening, according to the report.\nThe police confirmed the incident as a hit-and-run.\nFitri's family is also looking for any further information and witnesses of this accident.\nSmart watch alerted emergency contacts\nFitri said that his Apple's smart watch detected a hard fall and promptly sent a message to his emergency contacts, which included his girlfriend. The smart watch also called for an ambulance.\nWanbao added that passers-by also spoke to the girlfriend and told her what happened. She and Fitri's family then found out that it was the smart watch that contacted them.\nFitri's family said that they were very thankful for this life-saving function as the streets were relatively empty at that point of time.\nFitri could have missed the golden hour of rescue if not for the smart watch's function.\nFortunately, he slowly regained consciousness when the paramedics arrived at scene.\nIn response to Mothership's queries, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said that they were alerted to the accident at around 8:20pm. Fitri was conveyed to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.\nFall detection function not limited to Apple Watch\nAccording to Apple, models under Series 4 or later can detect hard falls.\nWhen a hard fall is detected, it will tap the user on their wrist, sound an alarm, and show an alert.\nThe watch will not alert emergency services if it detects movement from the user.\nHowever, if the user is immobile for at least one minute, the device will automatically call the emergency contacts and send a message to them. It will also call for an ambulance.\nSeveral smart watches have this function, including the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 and a few Garmin Watch models.\nFollow and listen to our podcast here\nTop image via Lianhe Wanbao",

        "title": "The iPhone 13 is a pitch-perfect iPhone 12S",
        "body": "Apple had a lot of new features to announce with its iPhone 13 lineup this week. The iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max have better battery life, faster A15 Bionic processors, smaller display notches, upgraded cameras, and, when it comes to the Pro models, high refresh rate 120Hz ProMotion displays.\nIt\u2019s a nice collection of updates, but take a step back and the range starts to look an awful lot like an iterative update over last year\u2019s iPhone 12. They have an almost identical look to the squared-off design introduced with last year\u2019s models, and Apple was careful to not directly compare the performance of its new A15 Bionic chip to last year\u2019s A14 Bionic, only to its competitors. There\u2019s also no major new initiative like the MagSafe ecosystem that Apple kicked off last year, and on the bottom of the phones you\u2019ll see the same old Lightning port rather than USB-C. It all feels very familiar.\nSo it\u2019s no wonder that much of tech Twitter immediately responded to the phones\u2019 announcement by referring to them as the \u201ciPhone 12S,\u201d aka a minor update to last year\u2019s iPhone 12. That\u2019s how Apple used to name its phones. There\u2019d be a major update one year, usually with a big design change, followed up with a more minor revision that changed some internal components and features but kept the overall look and feel the same. The iPhone 3GS, 4S, 5S, 6S, and XS all used this approach. So what changed?\nThe iPhone 5S, which added a fingerprint sensor to Apple\u2019s smartphone. Photo by Michael Shane / The Verge\nApple started to move away from this formula with 2016\u2019s iPhone 7. Not only did the iPhone 7 break the cycle by using a very similar design to the previous year\u2019s 6S instead of a new look (aside, of course, from the infamous missing headphone jack), but it was never followed by an S-model of its own. Instead, the next year Apple jumped straight to the iPhone 8, a minor revision that absolutely deserved to be called the 7S, and which ended up being completely overshadowed by that year\u2019s iPhone X.\nEver since 2018\u2019s iPhone XS, it seems like Apple has abandoned the S-suffix entirely. Every year gets a new number, regardless of whether it offers a major overhaul like the iPhone 12 or a more minor update like the iPhone 13.\nOf course, Apple\u2019s closest competitor in the US, Samsung, has been using this approach for years. Every subsequent Galaxy S device has had a bigger number than its predecessor, and nobody wants to be the company with the lower-numbered phone than its rival. In fact, if Apple had released an iPhone 7S in 2017 it would have competed against Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8. No wonder Apple jumped straight to 8 and skipped the iPhone 9 entirely.\nIt\u2019s wild in retrospect that Apple willingly advertised its \u201coff\u201d years\nIn retrospect it seems absolutely wild that Apple was willing to proudly broadcast that it was having an off year. Unless you were the kind of smartphone user that wanted to have the most up-to-date iPhone year after year, that S-suffix was a helpful indication that a new model only contained minor changes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about upgrading this year, folks,\u201d was the implicit message.\nBut the reality was that smartphone technology was advancing so quickly at the time that even a \u201cminor\u201d upgrade could still contain massive new features. The iPhone 3GS was the first iPhone that could officially record video in addition to taking photos, the iPhone 4S introduced Apple\u2019s Siri voice assistant to the world, and the 5S was the first iPhone with biometric security (a fingerprint sensor). These are all major additions that we now take for granted on modern Apple devices, and they arrived with the relatively muted fanfare of an S-branded iPhone. The S-branded iPhones also offered big camera improvements over the years: the 4S was the first with an 8-megapixel camera, the 5S added slow-motion video, and the 6S increased the rear camera\u2019s resolution to 12 megapixels. Every year, Apple gave its customers a pretty good reason to upgrade.\nThe iPhone 6S, the first iPhone with a 12-megapixel camera. Image: The Verge\nThe smartphone market is now a very different place. Smartphones have matured, and even midrange models offer basically everything most people actually need a phone to do. Every year we\u2019re told about the latest phones\u2019 performance upgrades and edge-case camera improvements, but it\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to completely change your life.\nConsumers have noticed. Far from upgrading to the latest iPhone every year, as of 2019 CNBC reported that US customers were waiting an average of over two years to upgrade their phones, while in the UK people were waiting almost 28 months. At the time, these figures were all trending upward, and it seems safe to assume that they\u2019ve grown even longer in the two years since. It was also around this time that iPhone sales started to plateau, and Apple stopped reporting on iPhone sales numbers, opting instead to bundle their numbers in with other device categories.\nInstead of focusing on big upgrades, Apple seems to be prioritizing a bigger lineup with devices to appeal to different tastes and price points. As recently as 2017, the company was selling just two flagship phones, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. The following year it released three (the 8, 8 Plus, and X), and last year it switched to four with the iPhone 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max. With so many form factors to keep updated, it\u2019s not surprising that big overhauls have become less common.\nPeople upgrade much less frequently than they once did\nUnless you really want the latest and greatest technology, there really isn\u2019t much of a reason to upgrade every year, and that\u2019s a good thing! It\u2019s much more affordable for those people who opt to buy their phones outright, and it\u2019s worlds better for the environment. Apple may now be using more recycled materials in its devices, but manufacturing them and shipping them in the first place still uses resources.\nIn this context, it isn\u2019t surprising that Apple has changed with the times. For starters, it\u2019s making more of an effort to make money outside of hardware, like its increasingly broad array of subscription services covering everything from music and video streaming, to gaming and home fitness. If it can\u2019t make money from selling you a new iPhone every year, it\u2019ll sure as hell try to make money from you streaming the latest season of Ted Lasso.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Apple has given up on the idea of selling you a new phone every year. Far from it. If branding this year\u2019s phones as the iPhone 13 tells us anything, it\u2019s that Apple is more keen than ever to convince its customers to upgrade, by branding this year\u2019s phones as an all-new range as opposed to a more modest update to the iPhone 12. The slowing progress of smartphone technology means that Apple can\u2019t afford to rest on its laurels with an S-branded device. Everything needs to be brand-new and as exciting as possible.",

        "title": "Apple Will Let iPhone 13 Pro Users Disable Auto Switching to Ultra Wide Lens for Macro Photography Later This Fall",
        "body": "iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max reviews were published today, with the devices receiving praise for their smoother ProMotion displays, longer battery life, and improved cameras, but there was one consistent complaint among the reviews.\nOn the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, a new feature is the ability to take macro photos. As noted by Input's Raymond Wong, however, this new capability results in the device automatically switching from the Wide lens to the Ultra Wide lens when you place an object or a subject within 5.5 inches of the rear camera. (The viewfinder still shows \"1x\" framing, but the camera relies on the Ultra Wide lens for autofocus.)\nThe automatic camera switching is easily noticeable in the iPhone's viewfinder, as Wong demonstrated in the video below.\n\"The viewfinder keeps jittering as it tries to choose between a regular wide or wide-macro shot,\" he said. In his review, he expressed his opinion that \"the framing should never change from what you compose and never automatically.\"\nApple initially told Wong that the automatic camera switching is intentional to help users better capture close-up details, according to his review, but the company has since issued a statement to Wong and others that says iPhone 13 Pro users will gain the option to turn off the switching in an iOS update that will be released later this fall.\n\"A new setting will be added in a software update this fall to turn off automatic camera switching when shooting at close distances for macro photography and video,\" said Apple.\nApple said the ability to turn off the automatic camera switching will apply to macro video recording as well, but as Wong noted, there is a \"Lock Camera\" option under Settings > Camera that appears to prevent the switching for video already.\nAll four iPhone 13 models will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores this Friday, September 24 in the U.S. and over 30 other countries and regions.",

        "title": "iOS 15 Adoption Estimated at Nearly 20% as Users Encounter Several Early Bugs",
        "body": "iOS 15 adoption has reached an estimated 19.3% since the software update was released September 20, according to mobile analytics company Mixpanel.\nMixpanel measures iOS adoption based on visits to websites and apps that use its mobile analytics SDKs, so the data is not official. Apple has yet to share iOS 15 adoption stats, having last reported an 85% adoption rate for iOS 14 back in June.\niOS 15 adoption appears to remain slower than iOS 14 adoption so far, and there are likely several reasons for that, including Apple providing iOS 14 users with the option to continue receiving important security updates, several iOS 15 features being delayed, and iOS 15 suffering from a handful of early bugs that still need to be fixed.\nFor example, Apple said an issue preventing some iPhone 13 users from using the Unlock with Apple Watch feature will be fixed in an upcoming software update. The feature is designed to let you unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask, but some users have encountered an \"Unable to Communicate with Apple Watch\" error message.\nThere's another iOS 15 bug where performing an iCloud Backup can result in photos saved from an iMessage conversation that is later deleted to disappear from the Photos app, intermittent touchscreen issues on iPhone 13 models, and other problems.\nApple is currently beta testing iOS 15.1, which includes a fix for the Unlock with Apple Watch bug at a minimum, but there is no timeframe for the software update's release. It's quite possible that Apple will opt to release a smaller update such as iOS 15.0.1 to more quickly address some of the bugs and security vulnerabilities that have surfaced.",

California is using SMART Health Cards, so users in California can add their vaccination records to the Wallet app after installing iOS 15.1.\nOther states and health organizations that use the SMART Health Cards will be able to use a button to let users know that they can download and store their vaccination information in the Health app and in the Wallet app.\nCalifornia, Louisiana, New York, Virginia, Hawaii, and some Maryland counties support Smart Health Cards, as do Walmart, Sam's Club, and CVS Health. So those in the specific supported states should be able to look up their information in state databases, but those who were vaccinated through companies like Walmart and CVS will also be able to add their information to the Health and Wallet apps because it's the same system.\nNote that some apps like the one used by the NHS in the UK allowed users to add their vaccination records to the Wallet app, but the new solution is a universal standard that will work for all healthcare providers/states that implement it.\nDiscussion should be limited to the app and implementation, and not politics.",

        "body": "One of the flagship new features in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 is the redesigned Safari web browser. While the highlight of the new Safari is its user interface, it also gains compatibility with more powerful, Mac-like browser extensions. Now that iOS 15 is available to download, there are plenty of extensions hitting the App Store, and we\u2019ve put together a list of some to try out.\nUsers of 1Password will love the new Safari extension in the latest update. The 1Password extension gives you the ability to see any password right in Safari and fill in password fields with saved ones. The extension can automatically fill in two-factor authentication codes as well. If you\u2019re using an iPad, you will get the entire desktop 1Password experience. The extension will appear in the toolbar for you to access at any time.\n1Password\u2019s new extension\nThe developer behind Apollo for Reddit, Christian Selig, has created a new Safari extension called Amplosion. Amplosion redirects you to the original webpage when you open an AMP link in Safari. The app also lets you keep track of how many times you\u2019ve visited an AMP link and how many times you\u2019ve used Amplosion to avoid one. Amplosion is priced at just $1.99 and if you hate AMP as much as I do it\u2019s well worth it.\nChristian has also created an extension that adds an HTML web inspector to Safari. The app is priced at $0.99 and is well worth it \u2013 since Apple still hasn\u2019t added its own inspector.\nAchoo extension on iPhone\nThe new CardPointers Safari extension knows what deals you may be able to take advantage of on different shopping websites. CardPointers says that it\u2019s compatible with thousands of websites. While shopping in Safari with the extension enabled, you\u2019ll get a notice telling you which card to use for the best deal as well as any special offers.\nCheep is an app that helps you find deals on Flights. With its latest update, it adds a Safari extension for use with Google Flights. The extension helps determine the cost per mile, distance in miles, and recommends whether or not you should book the flight. Cheep is free.\nAm excited for Cheep launch for iOS 15 today! https://t.co/IgcZ7i1upe\n\u2013 safari extension for google tells you the miles, cost per mile, and rating\n\u2013 personalize airline alliances for mileage run deals\n\u2013 minimum fare rating you want to see\n\u2013 integration with TikTok and Instagram pic.twitter.com/RpJ84MYmys \u2014 Jonathan Chum (@jchum) September 20, 2021\nThis app is a simple web inspector that appears to be designed to look familiar to those who frequently use one in Chrome on the Mac. This extension lets you inspect webpages and edit their elements, enter JavaScript commands, view network requests, and more. It\u2019s also entirely free.\nI just released Web Inspector for iOS and iPadOS. It's a Safari extension for web developers to edit web pages on the fly, debug JavaScript, and more.\nIt's free with no in-app purchases: https://t.co/u5mBSkMKnV pic.twitter.com/U1PdXv9VjK \u2014 Zhenyi Tan (@zhenyitan) September 20, 2021\nHyperWeb is a new extension that adds the ability to customize just about anything you want to in Safari while browsing the web. The app lets you create blockers, personalize search, and customize the design of webpages. The app can also recommend enhancements to enable to make the extension more powerful.\nSafari already has some translation features built-in but a new app from Gikken called Language Translator can help you take things to the next level. The app\u2019s new Safari extension can automatically translate sites in 40 languages without any work required by the user. You can also select text and get a pop-up window if you want to translate it to another language. The app is pricey though at $29.99 but if you frequently need to translate different sites in a multitude of languages it might be worth the buy.\nVidimote is a new Safari extension that allows you to control video playback from the toolbar. The extension lets you change the speed of videos, jump ahead, switch between PiP and fullscreen, and more. Vidimote is $4.99 and available now.\nStopTheMadness is a Safari extension that helps you take control of websites you frequently visit. The extensions lets you enable native iOS features like contextual menus, text editing, drag and drop, and autofill. The extension also improves privacy on the web by stopping clickjacking for different services among other things. StopTheMadness is priced at $7.99 on the App Store.",

She also says that she faced harassment and bullying from her manager and members of her team. More recently, she\u2019s begun raising privacy concerns related to Apple\u2019s policies on how it can search and surveil employees\u2019 work phones.\nShe was placed on administrative leave in early August while Apple investigated some of these concerns \u2014 a placement she says she requested as a last resort.\nA member of Apple\u2019s employee relations team reached out to Gj\u00f8vik earlier today saying the company was looking into a sensitive intellectual property matter and wanted to speak to her within the hour. Gj\u00f8vik said she wanted to keep all communications in writing, and noted she was forwarding the correspondence along to the NLRB, where she recently filed a charge. The employee relations representative responded to say that because she had chosen not to participate in the discussion, they would move forward with the information they had and \u2014 \u201cgiven the seriousness of these allegations\u201d \u2014 suspend her access to Apple systems.\nHours later, Gj\u00f8vik received an email that her employment at Apple was being terminated, effective tomorrow.",

        "body": "For the longest time, the App Store did not allow users to rate or review Apple\u2019s built-in iPhone and iPad apps, like Mail, Music, News, Stocks and Calculator. However, seemingly since the release of iOS 15 earlier this month, Apple has now lifted that restriction. It is now open season for App Store feedback on Apple\u2019s stock apps.\nAs you might expect, customer feedback is already flooding in for Apple\u2019s apps, with the Podcasts app currently faring the worst statistically with a 2.0 rating \u2026\nAlthough Apple had no reason to officially announce this policy change, it is possible Apple opened it up due to looming competitive pressure, as third-party apps are not allowed to hide their App Store ratings.\nYou can rate and review any Apple app that is deletable and re-installable via the App Store, so core system apps like Phone or Messages are exempt as they don\u2019t have App Store listings.\nAs the ability to rate and review is still quite new, most of the stock apps only have a few dozen ratings so far. However, you can imagine that everyone with grievances after upgrading to iOS 15 are rushing to the App Store to leave their one star \u2018constructive\u2019 feedback.\nOne of Apple\u2019s most popular services, Apple Music, has already clocked about 300 reviews with a 3.7 average rating.\nAs mentioned before, Podcasts is just crossing the 2-star mark as customers continue to complain about the changes from the iOS 14.5 app redesign. The Translate app manages just 2.2 stars, with reviewers noting that it pales in comparison to the quality of translations provided by competing apps like Google Translate. Apple News also doesn\u2019t achieve a passing grade at 2.3 stars, with many reviewers complaining about the app repeatedly crashing when browsing articles.\nNo Apple app approaches the fabled 5 star perfect score. Voice Memos seems to be Apple\u2019s highest-rated built-in app currently, sitting at 4 stars. Weather is also doing relatively well, at 3.7 stars, with customers appreciating the improvements brought by the iOS 15 update. However, there is a common feature request for both the Weather and Calculator apps \u2026\nThe reviews for Stocks are particularly comical:",

        "title": "Apple announces all-new iPad Mini with smaller bezels and new colors",
        "body": "Apple has announced its all-new iPad Mini. It features a new enclosure with narrower bezels and rounded corners. The big news is that it\u2019s larger than the iPad Mini 5 with an 8.3-inch display (up from its predecessor\u2019s 7.9-inch panel), making the device even more viable as a driver for multitasking or schoolwork. Apple says the screen can reach 500 nits of brightness and comes with anti-reflective coating.\nThe iPad Mini is currently Apple\u2019s smallest tablet, even with the bump in size. Apple was rumored to have been considering a Mini LED display on the new iPad, similar to that of its largest iPad Pro. Those appear to have missed the mark; the new Mini sports a regular Liquid Retina display.\nImage: Apple\nThe iPad Mini\u2019s design has remained largely consistent since its 2012 debut. The new model is something of a shake-up to the traditional build, featuring slimmer borders than the iPad Mini 5 and new color options including pink, purple, and \u201cstarlight\u201d, in addition to space gray.\nImage: Apple\nThe new tablet also features a USB-C port (with up to 5Gbps data transfer), Touch ID on the top button (still no Face ID), a new landscape stereo speaker system, and upgraded 12MP cameras on the front and back, including a shooter with True Tone flash and Focus Pixels on the rear and a new 12MP ultrawide camera on the front, which will support Apple\u2019s Center Stage feature. It also supports Wi-Fi 6 and optional 5G (with download speeds up to 3.5Gbps) as well as the second-generation Apple Pencil, which attaches magnetically to the iPad and charges wirelessly.\nThere are new slim Smart Folio covers but no mention of a keyboard cover. Image: Apple\nThe enclosure also incorporates 100 percent recycled aluminum; the solder of the main logic board includes 100 percent recycled tin, and the enclosure magnets and speakers are 100 percent recycled rare earth elements. Apple claims you can expect 40 percent faster CPU performance and 80 percent faster GPU performance, as well as all-day battery life, with the new A15 Bionic chip.\nThe new iPad Mini is up for order today and will be in stores on September 24th starting at $499. Cellular models start at $649. The new Smart Folio costs $59, and the second-generation iPad Pencil is available for $129.",

        "title": "Kuo: AirPods 3 to be announced at September event, at possible higher price as AirPods 2 will remain in the lineup",
        "body": "In a report from reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today, Apple is said to be announcing the new generation of AirPods as part of Tuesday\u2019s iPhone 13 event. The new \u2018AirPods 3\u2019 will be the new version of Apple\u2019s AirPods earbuds, which were last refreshed in March 2019.\nHowever, Kuo says that Apple will keep selling the second-generation AirPods when the new models ship. He says this suggest either AirPods 3 will be sold at a higher price \u2014 current models start at $159 \u2014 or that AirPods 2 will see a price drop alongside the AirPods 3 release, which would adopt the current AirPods 2\u2019s price point.\nKuo does not seem to know which scenario is more likely. Instead, he simply indicates that AirPods 2 and AirPods 3 will be sold simultaneously as AirPods 2 production continues.\nBased on previous rumors, the new AirPods models are expected to feature a new design that resembles the shape of the current-generation AirPods Pro, notably featuring shorter stems on the earbuds themselves.\nHowever, the AirPods 3 are not expected to feature active noise cancellation features \u2014 that will remain exclusive to AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. AirPods 3 are expected to support head-tracking Spatial Audio however, which lines up neatly with the release of iOS 15 that enhances Dolby Atmos music with the head-tracking effect in addition to video content.\nRight now, second-generation AirPods are sold in two models: with and without Qi wireless charging case. The AirPods with standard wired case sell for $159, the SKU with wireless case included costs $199.\nOverall, Kuo expects the launch of the new AirPods 3 generation to have a positive impact on Apple\u2019s truly wireless earbud sales, with the analyst predicting an increase in shipments of 10-15% YOY for the first quarter of 2022.\nUpdates to AirPods Pro are not expected until sometime next year. Bloomberg previously said that the AirPods Pro will be redesigned to be more compact as Apple intends to eliminate the stem altogether. They may also feature integrated sensors for fitness tracking.\nStay tuned to 9to5Mac for full coverage of all the announcements at Apple\u2019s first fall media event, which will kick off at 10 AM PT on Tuesday, 14 September. Alongside new AirPods, we expect to see Apple unveil the iPhone 13 lineup and the new Apple Watch Series 7.\nLooking to trade in your old AirPods in anticipation of the new ones?

        "title": "Report: M1X MacBook Pros to hit shelves in 'the next several weeks'",
        "body": "While Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 13 and Apple Watch Series 7 on Tuesday, it has additional announcements in store for later this fall. Perhaps most notably, this includes the long-awaited 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros powered by the M1X processor. A new report today indicates those machines could be available in \u201cthe next several weeks.\u201d\nIn the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Mark Gurman details iPhone 13 and Apple Watch Series 7 expectations, but also teases that Apple has other announcements planned for later this fall: new AIrPods, a redesigned iPad mini and entry-level iPad, and the M1X MacBook Pros.\nGurman writes that following delays, the new M1X MacBook Pros should be ready to \u201chit shelves in the next several weeks.\u201d\nM1X MacBook Pro: 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros with high-end M1 chips, MagSafe magnetic charging, miniLED screens, and no Touch Bars are in the offing. After delays, look out for these to hit shelves in the next several weeks.\nWe still don\u2019t expect the M1X MacBook Pros to be announced at Tuesday\u2019s event. Instead, what\u2019s more likely is that Apple holds a separate virtual event sometime in October to announce the new MacBook Pro hardware and new iPad hardware. A previous supply chain report had indicated that Apple is planning to ramp up M1X MacBook Pro production by October.\nThe new MacBook Pros will purportedly feature a new flat-edged design similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the latest iMac, iPad Pro, and iPhone 12 designs.\nBloomberg also reported that the new MacBook Pros will feature an HDMI port and an SD card slot, alongside the return of MagSafe technology for magnetic charging. Images and diagrams leaked as part of an Apple ransomware attack seemingly corroborated this.\nAre you planning to buy Apple\u2019s new M1X MacBook Pros when they\u2019re available this fall? Let us know down in the comments!\nThere will be two events, and I\u2019d expect the latter to be Mac + iPad. iPhone/Watch Tuesday. https://t.co/xfAjhUkigC \u2014 Mark Gurman (@markgurman) September 12, 2021",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nCredit: AppleInsider\nThe European Commission will soon present a legislative proposal that could institute a common charger for mobile devices in the EU, possibly forcing Apple to ditch Lightning for USB-C.\nEuropean officials have been pushing for a common charging standard for some time, despite protests from Apple and others in the technology industry.\nAccording to Reuters, the introduction of a legislative proposal implementing a common charging standard in Europe could come as soon as Thursday, Sept. 23.\nIn addition to a proposed harmonized charging port, the European Commission reportedly also wants the sales of charging hardware to be decoupled from devices.\nEU lawmakers claim that a common charger would be more convenient for consumers and would be more environmentally friendly. Apple has argued against mandated charging standards, claiming that they would dampen innovation, annoy consumers, and create unnecessary electronic waste.\nIt isn't clear what type of port the EU would mandate, but it would likely be USB-C. In 2018, half the chargers sold with mobile phones have a USB micro connector, while 29% had USB-C with an increase since. At the time, 21% had Apple's proprietary Lightning format but this has also increased with time.",
