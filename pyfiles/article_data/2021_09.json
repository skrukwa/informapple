There was much to celebrate, from our remarkable new product line-up to our values driven work around climate change, racial equity, and privacy. It was a good opportunity to reflect on our many accomplishments and to have a discussion about what\u2019s been on your mind.\nI\u2019m writing today because I\u2019ve heard from so many of you were were incredibly frustrated to see the contents of the meeting leak to reporters. This comes after a product launch in which most of the details of our announcements were also leaked to the press.\nI want you to know that I share your frustration. These opportunities to connect as a team are really important. But they only work if we can trust that the content will stay within Apple. I want to reassure you that we are doing everything in our power to identify those who leaked. As you know, we do not tolerate disclosures of confidential information, whether it\u2019s product IP or the details of a confidential meeting. We know that the leakers constitute a small number of people. We also know that people who leak confidential information do not belong here.\nAs we look forward, I want to thank you for all you\u2019ve done to make our products a reality and all you will do to get them into customers\u2019 hands. Yesterday we released iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and watchOS 8, and Friday marks the moment when we share some of our incredible new products with the world. There\u2019s nothing better than that. We\u2019ll continue to measure our contributions in the lives we change, the connections we foster, and the work we do to leave the world a better place.\nThank you,\nTim",

        "title": "Apple delays rollout of CSAM detection feature, commits to making improvements",
        "body": "Last month, Apple announced a handful of new child safety features that proved to be controversial, including CSAM detection for iCloud Photos. Now, Apple has said they will \u201ctake additional time\u201d to refine the features before launching to the public.\nIn a statement to 9to5Mac, Apple said:\n\u201cLast month we announced plans for features intended to help protect children from predators who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them, and limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material. Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.\u201d\nApple\u2019s new child safety features were set to launch as part of updates to iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey later this year. There is now no word on when the company plans to roll out the features. Apple\u2019s statement today does not provide any details on what changes the company could make to improve the system.\nAs a refresher, here\u2019s the basics of how the CSAM detection system would work as currently designed:\nApple\u2019s method of detecting known CSAM is designed with user privacy in mind. Instead of scanning images in the cloud, the system performs on-device matching using a database of known CSAM image hashes provided by NCMEC and other child safety organizations. Apple further transforms this database into an unreadable set of hashes that is securely stored on users\u2019 devices. Before an image is stored in iCloud Photos, an on-device matching process is performed for that image against the known CSAM hashes. This matching process is powered by a cryptographic technology called private set intersection, which determines if there is a match without revealing the result. The device creates a cryptographic safety voucher that encodes the match result along with additional encrypted data about the image. This voucher is uploaded to iCloud Photos along with the image.\nUpon announcement, the new CSAM detection technology received quite a bit of pushback and criticism from privacy advocates. Apple, however, doubled down on the feature multiple times, and said that its implementation would actually be more privacy-preserving than technology used by other companies like Google and Facebook.\nIt was also revealed through this process that Apple already scans iCloud Mail for CSAM, with the expansion applying to iCloud Photos.\nOther child safety features announced by Apple last month, and also now delayed, include communications safety features in Messages and updated knowledge information for Siri and Search.\nWhat do you make of Apple\u2019s decision to delay the rollout of its new child safety features? Is it the right decision, or should the company have stuck to its initial plan?\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "body": "Apple announced today that it would \u201ctake additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements\u201d to a program that will weaken privacy and security on iPhones and other products. EFF is pleased Apple is now listening to the concerns of customers, researchers, civil liberties organizations, human rights activists, LGBTQ people, youth representatives, and other groups, about the dangers posed by its phone scanning tools. But the company must go further than just listening, and drop its plans to put a backdoor into its encryption entirely.\nJOIN THE NATIONWIDE PROTEST\nTELL APPLE: DON'T SCAN OUR PHONES\nThe features Apple announced a month ago, intending to help protect children, would create an infrastructure that is all too easy to redirect to greater surveillance and censorship. These features would create an enormous danger to iPhone users\u2019 privacy and security, offering authoritarian governments a new mass surveillance system to spy on citizens. They also put already vulnerable kids at risk, especially LGBTQ youth, and create serious potential for danger to children in abusive households.\nThe responses to Apple\u2019s plans have been damning: over 90 organizations across the globe have urged the company not to implement them, for fear that they would lead to the censoring of protected speech, threaten the privacy and security of people around the world, and have disastrous consequences for many children. This week, EFF\u2019s petition to Apple demanding they abandon their plans reached 25,000 signatures. This is in addition to other petitions by groups such as Fight for the Future and OpenMedia, totaling well over 50,000 signatures. The enormous coalition that has spoken out will continue to demand that user phones\u2014both their messages and their photos\u2014be protected, and that the company maintain its promise to provide real privacy to its users.\nFurther Reading:",

        "body": "Despite a smaller notch, the iPhone 13 lineup will not show users their battery percentage in the status bar, or at least, not by default, according to the \u200ciPhone 13\u200c simulator embedded within Xcode.\nThe entire \u200ciPhone 13\u200c series features a smaller notch, allowing for more area to display content. While many customers may have hoped that a smaller notch would lead Apple to show the battery percentage in the status bar, that doesn't seem to be the case, at least for now.\nAs noted on Twitter, the Xcode 13 simulator for the iPhone 13 Pro Max shows the status bar without a battery percentage, despite ample room to shift the signal and Wi-Fi bars to the left. While the simulator in the release candidate of Xcode 13, released after yesterday's event, shows no battery percentage, Apple may offer it as an option within Settings.\nAccording to the Xcode Simulator, even though there\u2019s enough space on iPhone 13 Pro Max, it still doesn\u2019t show the battery percentage #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/TOc7mz48EL \u2014 Apple Software Updates (@AppleSWUpdates) September 14, 2021\nApple is unlikely to place the battery percentage in the status bar with no way for users to turn it off. With older iPhones that feature no notch, Apple includes an option within settings to toggle the percentage on or off, and a similar play could be in-store with the \u200ciPhone 13\u200c. Although it's worth noting that none of the \u200ciPhone 13\u200c or updated iOS 15 marketing images depict that as a possibility.\nThe \u200ciPhone 13\u200c and \u200ciPhone 13 Pro\u200c will begin shipping to customers on Friday, September 24, but we do expect reviews and hands-on impressions of the devices to be released before that. Those reviews and impressions will give us a definitive answer on whether Apple will finally allow customers to show their battery percentage in the status bar, rather than having to drag down on the right corner of the screen.",

        "title": "Apple announces first states to adopt driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet",
        "body": "September 1, 2021\nPRESS RELEASE\nApple announces first states signed up to adopt driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet\nArizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah are among the first states to bring state IDs and driver\u2019s licenses in Wallet to their residents\nCUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced that it is working with several states across the country, which will roll out the ability for their residents to seamlessly and securely add their driver\u2019s license or state ID to Wallet on their iPhone and Apple Watch. Arizona and Georgia will be the first states to introduce this new innovation to their residents, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah to follow. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will enable select airport security checkpoints and lanes in participating airports as the first locations customers can use their driver\u2019s license or state ID in Wallet. Built with privacy at the forefront, Wallet provides a more secure and convenient way for customers to present their driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs on iPhone or Apple Watch.\n\u201cThe addition of driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs to Apple Wallet is an important step in our vision of replacing the physical wallet with a secure and easy-to-use mobile wallet,\u201d said Jennifer Bailey, Apple\u2019s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. \u201cWe are excited that the TSA and so many states are already on board to help bring this to life for travelers across the country using only their iPhone and Apple Watch, and we are already in discussions with many more states as we\u2019re working to offer this nationwide in the future.\u201d\n\u201cThis new and innovative mobile driver\u2019s license and state ID initiative with Apple and states around the country will enable a more seamless airport security screening experience for travelers,\u201d said David Pekoske, TSA Administrator. \u201cThis initiative marks a major milestone by TSA to provide an additional level of convenience for the traveler by enabling more opportunities for touchless TSA airport security screening.\u201d\nSeamless and Secure Experience\nDriver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet will provide an easy, fast, and more secure way for people to present their driver\u2019s license or state ID using their iPhone or Apple Watch. Once a participating state begins offering this capability to its residents, customers will be able to add their driver\u2019s license or state ID to Wallet and simply tap their iPhone or Apple Watch to present it to the TSA, without taking out their physical card or handing over their device.\nAdding a driver\u2019s license or state ID to Wallet: Similar to how customers add new credit cards and transit passes to Wallet today, they can simply tap the + button at the top of the screen in Wallet on their iPhone to begin adding their license or ID. If the user has an Apple Watch paired to their iPhone, they will be prompted to also add their ID or driver\u2019s license to their Wallet app on their Apple Watch. The customer will then be asked to use their iPhone to scan their physical driver\u2019s license or state ID card and take a selfie, which will be securely provided to the issuing state for verification. As an additional security step, users will also be prompted to complete a series of facial and head movements during the setup process. Once verified by the issuing state, the customer\u2019s ID or driver\u2019s license will be added to Wallet.\nPresenting a driver\u2019s license or state ID to TSA: Once added to Wallet, customers can present their driver\u2019s license or state ID to the TSA by simply tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch at the identity reader. Upon tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch, customers will see a prompt on their device displaying the specific information being requested by the TSA. Only after authorizing with Face ID or Touch ID is the requested identity information released from their device, which ensures that just the required information is shared and only the person who added the driver\u2019s license or state ID to the device can present it. Users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device to present their ID.\nSecurity and Privacy\nWallet provides a convenient and more secure way to present driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs, while offering superior security and privacy over a physical wallet.\nApple and the issuing states do not know when or where users present their IDs.\nDriver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet take full advantage of the privacy and security built into iPhone and Apple Watch. Customers\u2019 identity data is encrypted and protected against tampering and theft. Biometric authentication using Face ID and Touch ID ensures that only the person who added the ID to the device can view or present their ID or license in Wallet.\nDriver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet are only presented digitally through encrypted communication directly between the device and the identity reader, so users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device.\nIf a user misplaces their iPhone or Apple Watch, they can use the Find My app to lock their device and help locate it, or remotely erase a device.\nApple\u2019s mobile ID implementation supports the ISO 18013-5 mDL (mobile driver\u2019s license) standard which Apple has played an active role in the development of, and which sets clear guidelines for the industry around protecting consumers\u2019 privacy when presenting an ID or driver\u2019s license through a mobile device.\nStates Across the Country See Benefits of IDs in Wallet\nStates across the country are looking forward to the superior security and convenience that driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet provide to them and their users.\n\u201cArizona is at the leading edge of states making mobile IDs available to the public, and we are pleased to work with Apple and give Arizonans the choice, convenience, and security of adding their driver\u2019s license to their Apple Wallet,\u201d said Eric Jorgensen, director of the Arizona Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Division. \u201cBeyond being innovative and exciting, a digital version of a driver\u2019s license offers increased security and privacy for our residents, making it something everyone should consider.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring a new addition to our state\u2019s modernization efforts that will make our residents\u2019 lives easier, and keep their identities secure through the use of mobile driver\u2019s licenses in Apple Wallet,\u201d said Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to be one of the first states working with Apple to deploy driver\u2019s licenses and state identification cards in Apple Wallet, and we\u2019re looking forward to taking the next steps to make sure this new feature benefits our residents.\u201d\n\u201cGeorgia is a national leader when it comes to the safety and security of its driver and identity credentialing process, with more than 99 percent of Georgians REAL ID compliant, and the state of Georgia is equally as committed to safety and security through our mobile driver\u2019s licensing (mDL) efforts with Apple,\u201d said Spencer R. Moore, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Driver Services. \u201cTogether, we will deliver customer convenience through touchless identity verification and enhanced security and privacy protection through technology. We are honored to work with Apple as an initial adopter for such a revolutionary customer experience. A state-issued credential has become the standard for which institutions of all sectors use as a trusted source of identity proofing. The identity proofing bar has been raised significantly thanks to Apple and innovative states like Georgia.\u201d\n\u201cWe are glad to see Apple advance the acceptance of mobile driver\u2019s licenses by offering a secure and convenient way to present a mobile driver\u2019s license with Apple Wallet,\u201d said Melissa Gillett, director of the Iowa Motor Vehicle Division. \u201cPrivacy and security have been at the forefront of our mobile driver\u2019s license development process and we appreciate Apple\u2019s proven reputation in these areas, as well as the shared commitment to following the ISO 18013-5 standard.\u201d\n\u201cThe Kentucky Transportation Cabinet is excited to be leading the pack through this innovative collaboration with Apple to further deliver on our pledge to take driver licensing to the next level,\u201d said Matt Cole, commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Vehicle Regulation. \u201cThe potential for mobile driver\u2019s licenses is limitless, and we look forward to taking steps to continue to offer modern conveniences to Kentuckians while maintaining our unwavering commitment to security and privacy.\u201d\n\u201cMaryland is proud to be a leader once again in safe innovation with the implementation of mobile driver\u2019s licenses,\u201d said Maryland Governor Larry Hogan. \u201cAs we look to the future, we are committed to enhancing convenience and accessibility while maintaining the highest safety and security standards for our state and citizens.\u201d\n\u201cWe are excited to work with Apple on mobile IDs in Apple Wallet. This innovative project is yet another example of the momentum we are building as a state in our continued efforts to be a national leader in the digital transformation space,\u201d said Jerry Moore, CIO of the state of Oklahoma.\n\u201cUtah has always been a forward-looking state. We regularly hear from people who want to access their driver license through their phones,\u201d said Jess Anderson, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for Utah to work with Apple in an innovative use of technology. This secure mobile license adds convenience while helping keep Utah safe.\u201d\nParticipating states and the TSA will share more information at a later date about when support for mobile driver\u2019s licenses and state IDs in Wallet will be available in each state, and which TSA airport security checkpoints and select lanes it will be available at first.\nApple Wallet on iPhone and Apple Watch offers an easy, secure, and convenient way to do everything from paying for groceries to accessing your favorite entertainment venues. With Wallet, users can pay in-store, online, and in-apps with Apple Pay, pay for and ride public transportation in cities across the globe, unlock their car, and access airline boarding passes, event tickets, and loyalty rewards programs. University and college students, as well as faculty can also tap their device to use their mobile student ID in Wallet to make purchases and get around campus. Coming soon, Wallet will also provide access to customers\u2019 home, apartment, and hotel keys, as well as corporate badges.

        "body": "Apple is rumored to be in Asia visiting Toyota as it prepares to lay the supplier groundwork to mass produce a branded car by 2024, according to a new report by DigiTimes.\nApple representatives were said to have met with South Korea's SK Group and LG Electronics last month to discuss Apple Car development, and now Japan's Toyota is being touted as its next potential destination.\nApple has been working on a car-related project since at least 2014, and at one stage it looked as if the company was scaling back to focus on autonomous vehicle software. However, following several changes in management and hiring, Apple is now believed to be focused on building a car for consumers.\nBut to do that, the company needs to tap into a whole new supply chain. Apple is expected to rely on a manufacturing partner to build the vehicles, and though it wants to make EV batteries in the United States, it may be seeking partnerships with established vehicle makers like Toyota to do so.\nReuters has previously reported that Apple is developing a new battery design that has the potential to \"radically\" reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle's range.\nOne person who spoke to Reuters described Apple's \"monocle\" battery technology as \"next level\" and said that it's similar to \"the first time you saw the iPhone.\"\nReuters' reporting claimed that Apple is aiming to begin production on an Apple-branded self-driving vehicle starting in 2024, so DigiTimes' focus on that date isn't necessarily a shot in the dark. However, delays caused by the ongoing global health crisis or current chip shortage could always push production to 2025 or beyond.",

As noted by Input's Raymond Wong, however, this new capability results in the device automatically switching from the Wide lens to the Ultra Wide lens when you place an object or a subject within 5.5 inches of the rear camera. (The viewfinder still shows \"1x\" framing, but the camera relies on the Ultra Wide lens for autofocus.)\nThe automatic camera switching is easily noticeable in the iPhone's viewfinder, as Wong demonstrated in the video below.\n\"The viewfinder keeps jittering as it tries to choose between a regular wide or wide-macro shot,\" he said. In his review, he expressed his opinion that \"the framing should never change from what you compose and never automatically.\"\nApple initially told Wong that the automatic camera switching is intentional to help users better capture close-up details, according to his review, but the company has since issued a statement to Wong and others that says iPhone 13 Pro users will gain the option to turn off the switching in an iOS update that will be released later this fall.\n\"A new setting will be added in a software update this fall to turn off automatic camera switching when shooting at close distances for macro photography and video,\" said Apple.\nApple said the ability to turn off the automatic camera switching will apply to macro video recording as well, but as Wong noted, there is a \"Lock Camera\" option under Settings > Camera that appears to prevent the switching for video already.\nAll four iPhone 13 models will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores this Friday, September 24 in the U.S. and over 30 other countries and regions.",

        "title": "The iPhone 13 is a pitch-perfect iPhone 12S",
        "body": "Apple had a lot of new features to announce with its iPhone 13 lineup this week. The iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max have better battery life, faster A15 Bionic processors, smaller display notches, upgraded cameras, and, when it comes to the Pro models, high refresh rate 120Hz ProMotion displays.\nIt\u2019s a nice collection of updates, but take a step back and the range starts to look an awful lot like an iterative update over last year\u2019s iPhone 12. They have an almost identical look to the squared-off design introduced with last year\u2019s models, and Apple was careful to not directly compare the performance of its new A15 Bionic chip to last year\u2019s A14 Bionic, only to its competitors. There\u2019s also no major new initiative like the MagSafe ecosystem that Apple kicked off last year, and on the bottom of the phones you\u2019ll see the same old Lightning port rather than USB-C. It all feels very familiar.\nSo it\u2019s no wonder that much of tech Twitter immediately responded to the phones\u2019 announcement by referring to them as the \u201ciPhone 12S,\u201d aka a minor update to last year\u2019s iPhone 12. That\u2019s how Apple used to name its phones. There\u2019d be a major update one year, usually with a big design change, followed up with a more minor revision that changed some internal components and features but kept the overall look and feel the same. The iPhone 3GS, 4S, 5S, 6S, and XS all used this approach. So what changed?\nThe iPhone 5S, which added a fingerprint sensor to Apple\u2019s smartphone. Photo by Michael Shane / The Verge\nApple started to move away from this formula with 2016\u2019s iPhone 7. Not only did the iPhone 7 break the cycle by using a very similar design to the previous year\u2019s 6S instead of a new look (aside, of course, from the infamous missing headphone jack), but it was never followed by an S-model of its own. Instead, the next year Apple jumped straight to the iPhone 8, a minor revision that absolutely deserved to be called the 7S, and which ended up being completely overshadowed by that year\u2019s iPhone X.\nEver since 2018\u2019s iPhone XS, it seems like Apple has abandoned the S-suffix entirely. Every year gets a new number, regardless of whether it offers a major overhaul like the iPhone 12 or a more minor update like the iPhone 13.\nOf course, Apple\u2019s closest competitor in the US, Samsung, has been using this approach for years. Every subsequent Galaxy S device has had a bigger number than its predecessor, and nobody wants to be the company with the lower-numbered phone than its rival. In fact, if Apple had released an iPhone 7S in 2017 it would have competed against Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8. No wonder Apple jumped straight to 8 and skipped the iPhone 9 entirely.\nIt\u2019s wild in retrospect that Apple willingly advertised its \u201coff\u201d years\nIn retrospect it seems absolutely wild that Apple was willing to proudly broadcast that it was having an off year. Unless you were the kind of smartphone user that wanted to have the most up-to-date iPhone year after year, that S-suffix was a helpful indication that a new model only contained minor changes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about upgrading this year, folks,\u201d was the implicit message.\nBut the reality was that smartphone technology was advancing so quickly at the time that even a \u201cminor\u201d upgrade could still contain massive new features. The iPhone 3GS was the first iPhone that could officially record video in addition to taking photos, the iPhone 4S introduced Apple\u2019s Siri voice assistant to the world, and the 5S was the first iPhone with biometric security (a fingerprint sensor). These are all major additions that we now take for granted on modern Apple devices, and they arrived with the relatively muted fanfare of an S-branded iPhone. The S-branded iPhones also offered big camera improvements over the years: the 4S was the first with an 8-megapixel camera, the 5S added slow-motion video, and the 6S increased the rear camera\u2019s resolution to 12 megapixels. Every year, Apple gave its customers a pretty good reason to upgrade.\nThe iPhone 6S, the first iPhone with a 12-megapixel camera. Image: The Verge\nThe smartphone market is now a very different place. Smartphones have matured, and even midrange models offer basically everything most people actually need a phone to do. Every year we\u2019re told about the latest phones\u2019 performance upgrades and edge-case camera improvements, but it\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to completely change your life.\nConsumers have noticed. Far from upgrading to the latest iPhone every year, as of 2019 CNBC reported that US customers were waiting an average of over two years to upgrade their phones, while in the UK people were waiting almost 28 months. At the time, these figures were all trending upward, and it seems safe to assume that they\u2019ve grown even longer in the two years since. It was also around this time that iPhone sales started to plateau, and Apple stopped reporting on iPhone sales numbers, opting instead to bundle their numbers in with other device categories.\nInstead of focusing on big upgrades, Apple seems to be prioritizing a bigger lineup with devices to appeal to different tastes and price points. As recently as 2017, the company was selling just two flagship phones, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. The following year it released three (the 8, 8 Plus, and X), and last year it switched to four with the iPhone 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max. With so many form factors to keep updated, it\u2019s not surprising that big overhauls have become less common.\nPeople upgrade much less frequently than they once did\nUnless you really want the latest and greatest technology, there really isn\u2019t much of a reason to upgrade every year, and that\u2019s a good thing! It\u2019s much more affordable for those people who opt to buy their phones outright, and it\u2019s worlds better for the environment. Apple may now be using more recycled materials in its devices, but manufacturing them and shipping them in the first place still uses resources.\nIn this context, it isn\u2019t surprising that Apple has changed with the times. For starters, it\u2019s making more of an effort to make money outside of hardware, like its increasingly broad array of subscription services covering everything from music and video streaming, to gaming and home fitness. If it can\u2019t make money from selling you a new iPhone every year, it\u2019ll sure as hell try to make money from you streaming the latest season of Ted Lasso.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Apple has given up on the idea of selling you a new phone every year. Far from it. If branding this year\u2019s phones as the iPhone 13 tells us anything, it\u2019s that Apple is more keen than ever to convince its customers to upgrade, by branding this year\u2019s phones as an all-new range as opposed to a more modest update to the iPhone 12. The slowing progress of smartphone technology means that Apple can\u2019t afford to rest on its laurels with an S-branded device. Everything needs to be brand-new and as exciting as possible.",

Apple has yet to share iOS 15 adoption stats, having last reported an 85% adoption rate for iOS 14 back in June.\niOS 15 adoption appears to remain slower than iOS 14 adoption so far, and there are likely several reasons for that, including Apple providing iOS 14 users with the option to continue receiving important security updates, several iOS 15 features being delayed, and iOS 15 suffering from a handful of early bugs that still need to be fixed.\nFor example, Apple said an issue preventing some iPhone 13 users from using the Unlock with Apple Watch feature will be fixed in an upcoming software update. The feature is designed to let you unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask, but some users have encountered an \"Unable to Communicate with Apple Watch\" error message.\nThere's another iOS 15 bug where performing an iCloud Backup can result in photos saved from an iMessage conversation that is later deleted to disappear from the Photos app, intermittent touchscreen issues on iPhone 13 models, and other problems.\nApple is currently beta testing iOS 15.1, which includes a fix for the Unlock with Apple Watch bug at a minimum, but there is no timeframe for the software update's release. It's quite possible that Apple will opt to release a smaller update such as iOS 15.0.1 to more quickly address some of the bugs and security vulnerabilities that have surfaced.",

California is using SMART Health Cards, so users in California can add their vaccination records to the Wallet app after installing iOS 15.1.\nOther states and health organizations that use the SMART Health Cards will be able to use a button to let users know that they can download and store their vaccination information in the Health app and in the Wallet app.\nCalifornia, Louisiana, New York, Virginia, Hawaii, and some Maryland counties support Smart Health Cards, as do Walmart, Sam's Club, and CVS Health. So those in the specific supported states should be able to look up their information in state databases, but those who were vaccinated through companies like Walmart and CVS will also be able to add their information to the Health and Wallet apps because it's the same system.\nNote that some apps like the one used by the NHS in the UK allowed users to add their vaccination records to the Wallet app, but the new solution is a universal standard that will work for all healthcare providers/states that implement it.\nDiscussion should be limited to the app and implementation, and not politics.",

The new \u2018AirPods 3\u2019 will be the new version of Apple\u2019s AirPods earbuds, which were last refreshed in March 2019.\nHowever, Kuo says that Apple will keep selling the second-generation AirPods when the new models ship. He says this suggest either AirPods 3 will be sold at a higher price \u2014 current models start at $159 \u2014 or that AirPods 2 will see a price drop alongside the AirPods 3 release, which would adopt the current AirPods 2\u2019s price point.\nKuo does not seem to know which scenario is more likely. Instead, he simply indicates that AirPods 2 and AirPods 3 will be sold simultaneously as AirPods 2 production continues.\nBased on previous rumors, the new AirPods models are expected to feature a new design that resembles the shape of the current-generation AirPods Pro, notably featuring shorter stems on the earbuds themselves.\nHowever, the AirPods 3 are not expected to feature active noise cancellation features \u2014 that will remain exclusive to AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. AirPods 3 are expected to support head-tracking Spatial Audio however, which lines up neatly with the release of iOS 15 that enhances Dolby Atmos music with the head-tracking effect in addition to video content.\nRight now, second-generation AirPods are sold in two models: with and without Qi wireless charging case. The AirPods with standard wired case sell for $159, the SKU with wireless case included costs $199.\nOverall, Kuo expects the launch of the new AirPods 3 generation to have a positive impact on Apple\u2019s truly wireless earbud sales, with the analyst predicting an increase in shipments of 10-15% YOY for the first quarter of 2022.\nUpdates to AirPods Pro are not expected until sometime next year.

Let us know down in the comments!\nThere will be two events, and I\u2019d expect the latter to be Mac + iPad. iPhone/Watch Tuesday. https://t.co/xfAjhUkigC \u2014 Mark Gurman (@markgurman) September 12, 2021\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "EU pressing on with USB-C charger legislation on Thursday",
        "body": "Credit: AppleInsider\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nThe European Commission will soon present a legislative proposal that could institute a common charger for mobile devices in the EU, possibly forcing Apple to ditch Lightning for USB-C.\nEuropean officials have been pushing for a common charging standard for some time, despite protests from Apple and others in the technology industry.\nAccording to Reuters, the introduction of a legislative proposal implementing a common charging standard in Europe could come as soon as Thursday, Sept. 23.\nIn addition to a proposed harmonized charging port, the European Commission reportedly also wants the sales of charging hardware to be decoupled from devices.\nEU lawmakers claim that a common charger would be more convenient for consumers and would be more environmentally friendly. Apple has argued against mandated charging standards, claiming that they would dampen innovation, annoy consumers, and create unnecessary electronic waste.\nIt isn't clear what type of port the EU would mandate, but it would likely be USB-C. In 2018, half the chargers sold with mobile phones have a USB micro connector, while 29% had USB-C with an increase since. At the time, 21% had Apple's proprietary Lightning format but this has also increased with time.",

        "title": "Apple Maps rolls out 3D view to London, LA, New York, and San Francisco",
        "body": "Apple is bringing its 3D maps to more cities within the Apple Maps app, including London, LA, New York and San Francisco. The experience, launching with iOS 15, follows several years of investment in Apple\u2019s mapping platform to make the app more competitive with the market leader, Google Maps. This has included not only the addition of 3D maps, like those arriving now to major markets, but also overall more detailed maps, improved transit features, AR viewing modes and more.\nMany of these features have taken time to roll out, with major metros around the U.S. and world being the first to gain the enhancements. AR viewing, for instance, only began launching to select cities this year.\nWith 3D maps, however, Apple Maps users will be able to see more details for areas across the city, including their neighborhoods, commercial districts, marinas, buildings and more, the company says, along with elevation details, new road labels and even custom-designed landmarks.\nFor example, Apple Maps will show renderings for famous spots, like Coit Tower in San Francisco, Dodger Stadium in LA, the Statue of Liberty in NYC and the Royal Albert Hall in London, with more landmarks to come in time.\nLater this year, these sorts of 3D maps will become available in Philadelphia, San Diego and Washington, D.C., Apple says. Then, next year, they\u2019ll arrive in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.\nApple is also enhancing its road-level navigation in Apple Maps, with more clearly displayed turn lanes, medians, bus and taxi lanes, and crosswalks. These appear in a 3D viewing mode which makes it easier to see the best lane to choose based on traffic conditions or for better route planning purposes. The app will also display the estimated time of arrival, based on the current conditions, as Google Maps does. This new navigation, which was previously announced for a 2021 release, will arrive in CarPlay later this year, Apple said, without giving a more specific deadline.\nSimilarly, other major maps updates, which had been announced earlier this year, are also now rolling out. This includes transit features designed to make Apple Maps more competitive with third-party apps often favored by transit takers, like Citymapper. Now, nearby transit stations are prominently displayed at the top of the screen and users can pin favorite lines in Maps for easy access. And once a route is selected, Maps will automatically notify users when it\u2019s time to disembark \u2014 something users can track on their Apple Watch, too.\nApple Maps offers more immersive walking directions with step-by-step guidance powered by augmented reality. This allows users to raise their phone to scan the buildings in their area, which lets Maps generate a more accurate position in order to provide more detailed guidance. This has been rolling out to select markets over the course of the year.\nIn addition, iOS 15 users can view a new 3D globe of the earth and they can tap an Explore Guides button in the Apple Maps app to access curated Guides from brands like Time Out, The Washington Post, the National Park Foundation, Complex and The Infatuation. These will offer suggestions about things to do or see in various cities worldwide. Users can also make guides of their own to share with friends and family.",

All the person had to do was send 0.1 to 20 Bitcoin through a QR code to have double that amount sent back.This was a scam, but there was just enough care taken to convince people it was legitimate. Over $69k was sent to that Bitcoin wallet showing the scheme was highly successful.Those with some technological background might spot several flaws with the website, from the grammar problems to the .org URL. However, most people with just a passing understanding of technology could have easily mistaken such a website for a legitimate promotion.The scammer's website is currently down and will likely remain down after successfully swindling folks out of $69,000 in Bitcoin, the report said.Scams like this have occurred on YouTube before, with random channels being hacked to display Bitcoin promotions.
