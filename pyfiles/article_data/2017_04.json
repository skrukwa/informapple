        "title": "Apple promises to stop mining the earth, build all products from recycled materials",
        "body": "Apple has a history of being one of the most environmentally conscious companies, and it\u2019s about to take those efforts a step further. According to Apple\u2019s 2017 Environment Responsibility Report released today, the company\u2019s latest environmental initiative will see it \u201cstop mining the earth altogether.\u201d\n\u201cClimate change is undeniable. Earth\u2019s resources won\u2019t last forever. And technology must be safe for people to make and use. We don\u2019t question these realities \u2014 we challenge ourselves to ask what we can do about them in every part of our business.\u201d\nApple says that it will start making devices entirely from recycled materials, including aluminum, copper, tin, and tungsten. The issue, however, is that the company doesn\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to do this yet.\n\u201cIt sounds crazy, but we\u2019re working on it. We\u2019re moving toward a closed-loop supply chain. One day we\u2019d like to be able to build new products with just recycled materials, including your old products.\u201d\nSpeaking to Vice in an exclusive interview, Apple VP of environment, policy, and social initiatives Lisa Jackson explained that this move is an important one because it\u2019s more about pushing the entire industry towards a goal:\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we\u2019ve completely figured out how to do it. So we\u2019re a little nervous, but we also think it\u2019s really important, because as a sector we believe it\u2019s where technology should be going.\u201d\nJackson also explained that only a small amount of what\u2019s inside the iPhone right now comes from recycled material. The goal, however, is for Apple to eventually combine high quality recycled metals from suppliers with what\u2019s taken from Apple products returned by consumers. \u201cWe are committing as a company to not necessarily having to source from the earth for everything that we need,\u201d Jackson noted.\nApple\u2019s 2017 Environment Responsibility Report also offers a few more tidbits on its environmental process. The company now powers its facilities by 96 percent renewable energy, up from 93 percent last year. Furthermore, Apple says seven of its major suppliers have promised to use renewable energy by the end of next year.\nApple shifting from mining to the use of recycled materials is notable. The company in the past has come under fire for various issues relating to its mining. Just over a year ago, an investigation claimed that Apple\u2019s battery suppliers were using cobalt mined by child labor. It was also reported at one point that Apple was using tin from illegal mines.\nApple\u2019s full 2017 Environment Responsibility Report can be found here.\nVICE News Tonight starts now with an exclusive look inside one of Apple's testing facilities.

        "title": "Daring Fireball: The Mac Pro Lives",
        "body": "The Mac Pro Lives\nLet\u2019s not beat around the bush. I have great news to share:\nApple is currently hard at work on a \u201ccompletely rethought\u201d Mac Pro, with a modular design that can accommodate high-end CPUs and big honking hot-running GPUs, and which should make it easier for Apple to update with new components on a regular basis. They\u2019re also working on Apple-branded pro displays to go with them.\nI also have not-so-great news:\nThese next-gen Mac Pros and pro displays \u201cwill not ship this year\u201d. (I hope that means \u201cnext year\u201d, but all Apple said was \u201cnot this year\u201d.) In the meantime, Apple is today releasing meager speed-bump updates to the existing Mac Pros. The $2999 model goes from 4 Xeon CPU cores to 6, and from dual AMD G300 GPUs to dual G500 GPUs. The $3999 model goes from 6 CPU cores to 8, and from dual D500 GPUs to dual D800 D700 GPUs. Nothing else is changing, including the ports. No USB-C, no Thunderbolt 3 (and so no support for the LG UltraFine 5K display).\nBut more good news, too:\nApple has \u201cgreat\u201d new iMacs in the pipeline, slated for release \u201cthis year\u201d, including configurations specifically targeted at large segments of the pro market.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re Apple. You\u2019re faced with the following problem. Three years ago you launched a radical new lineup of Mac Pros. For multiple reasons, you haven\u2019t shipped an update to those machines since. At some point you came to the conclusion that the 2013 Mac Pro concept was fundamentally flawed. It was tightly integrated internally, which allowed for some very nice features: it was small and beautiful (a pro machine that demanded placement on your desk, not under your desk) and it could run whisper quietly. But that tight integration made it hard to update regularly. The idea that expansion could be handled almost entirely by external Thunderbolt peripherals sounded good on paper, but hasn\u2019t panned out in practice. And the GPU design was a bad prediction. Apple bet on a dual-GPU design (multiple smaller GPUs, with \u201cpro\u201d-level performance coming from parallel processing) but the industry has gone largely in the other direction (machines with one big GPU).\nAnd so you decided to completely redesign the Mac Pro. But that new design isn\u2019t going to ship this year. You\u2019re committed to your pro users, but a sizable chunk of them are growing ever more restless. They suspect \u2014 in some cases strongly \u2014 that you don\u2019t care about them anymore. They see the stalled Mac Pro lineup as a sign that Apple no longer cares about them, and they worry deeply that the Mac Pro isn\u2019t merely waiting for a major update but instead is waiting to be decommissioned.\nWhat do you do?\nThere are really only two options at this point. The first would be to suck it up and wait until the next-generation Mac Pros are ready to be announced, and suffer in silence while more and more people point to the current Mac Pro\u2019s stagnation as proof that Apple is abandoning the Mac Pro market.\nThe second would be to bite the bullet and tell the world what your plans are, even though it\u2019s your decades-long tradition \u2014 a fundamental part of the company\u2019s culture \u2014 to let actual shipping products, not promises of future products, tell your story.\nApple chose the latter.\nWe\u2019re inside a nondescript single-story office building on Apple\u2019s extended old campus, across De Anza Boulevard from One Infinite Loop. This is Apple\u2019s Product Realization Lab for Mac hardware, better known, internally, as \u201cthe machine lab\u201d. This is where they make and refine prototypes for new Mac hardware. We don\u2019t get to see anything cool. There is no moment where they lift a black cloth and show us prototypes of future hardware. The setting feels chosen simply to set the tone that innovative Mac hardware design \u2014 across the entire Mac lineup \u2014 is not a thing of the past.\nThere are only nine people at the table. Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi, and John Ternus (vice president, hardware engineering \u2014 in charge of Mac hardware) are there to speak for Apple. Bill Evans from Apple PR is there to set the ground rules and run the clock. (We had 90 minutes.) The other five are writers who were invited for what was billed as \u201ca small roundtable discussion about the Mac\u201d: Matthew Panzarino, Lance Ulanoff, Ina Fried, John Paczkowski, and yours truly.\nThe discussion is on the record.\nHere\u2019s how Schiller broke the news on Mac Pro. It\u2019s worth quoting him at length:\nWith regards to the Mac Pro, we are in the process of what we call \u201ccompletely rethinking the Mac Pro\u201d. We\u2019re working on it. We have a team working hard on it right now, and we want to architect it so that we can keep it fresh with regular improvements, and we\u2019re committed to making it our highest-end, high-throughput desktop system, designed for our demanding pro customers. As part of doing a new Mac Pro \u2014 it is, by definition, a modular system \u2014 we will be doing a pro display as well. Now you won\u2019t see any of those products this year; we\u2019re in the process of that. We think it\u2019s really important to create something great for our pro customers who want a Mac Pro modular system, and that\u2019ll take longer than this year to do. In the interim, we know there are a number of customers who continue to buy our [current Mac Pros]. To be clear, our current Mac Pro has met the needs of some of our customers, and we know clearly not all of our customers. None of this is black and white, it\u2019s a wide variety of customers. Some\u2026 it\u2019s the kind of system they wanted; others, it was not. In the meantime, we\u2019re going to update the configs to make it faster and better for their dollar. This is not a new model, not a new design, we\u2019re just going to update the configs. We\u2019re doing that this week. We can give you the specifics on that. The CPUs, we\u2019re moving them down the line. The GPUs, down the line, to get more performance per dollar for customers who DO need to continue to buy them on the interim until we get to a newly architected system.\nIn an ideal world, yes, these next-gen Mac Pros (and new displays) would be shipping soon. In fact, if we\u2019re going to say ideal, they\u2019d already be shipping. But make no mistake, this is very good news for anyone who cares about the Mac Pro. Those of us with an ear to the ground knew that there were no major changes to the Mac Pro shipping soon. That meant one of two things: next-gen Mac Pros were a ways off, or Apple was abandoning the Mac Pro market.\nGiven that, this is very good news for serious Mac users. Even for serious Mac users who don\u2019t buy Mac Pro hardware, this is good news because it\u2019s a sign of Apple\u2019s commitment to pro Mac software. There is no reason for Apple to commit itself to a new modular Mac Pro unless they\u2019re also committed to what makes the Mac the Mac in software.\nSome stats and facts Apple shared with us during the discussion:\nApple\u2019s research shows that 15 percent of all Mac users use at least one \u201cpro\u201d app frequently. These are apps for things like music creation, video editing, graphic design, and software development. Basically, apps that are performance intensive. An additional 15 percent of Mac users use pro apps less frequently but at least a few times per month. That 30 percent of the overall Mac user base is what Apple considers the \u201cpro\u201d market.\nOverall, the split between notebooks and desktops in Mac sales is roughly 80/20. (Personally, I\u2019m a little surprised desktops account for even 20 percent of sales. I would have guessed 85/15, and wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to hear 90/10.)\nEven among pro users, notebooks are by far the most popular Macs. In second place are iMacs. The Mac Pro is third. Apple declined to describe the Mac Pro\u2019s share of all Mac sales any more specifically than \u201ca single-digit percent\u201d, but my gut feeling is that the single digit is a lot closer to 1 than it is to 9.\nSo: only 30 percent of Mac users are in what Apple considers the pro market. Most of those use MacBook Pros (or other MacBooks). Most of those who use desktops use iMacs. None of this is a surprise, really \u2014 and this is exactly why so many users who depend on the Mac Pro have been deeply concerned about its future. For Apple to care about the Mac Pro, it requires Apple to care about a small number of users.\nRegarding iMacs, Schiller also said that new iMacs are in the works, slated for release some time this year (no specifics other than \u201cthis year\u201d), including \u201cconfigurations of iMac specifically with the pro customer in mind and acknowledging that our most popular desktop with pros is an iMac.\u201d\nCraig Federighi then jumped in, and said:\nThat is a pretty incredible evolution that we\u2019ve seen over the last decade. The original iMac, you never would\u2019ve thought as remotely touching pro uses. And now you look at today\u2019s 5K iMac, top configs, it\u2019s incredibly powerful, and a huge fraction of what would\u2019ve traditionally \u2014 whether it\u2019s audio editing, video editing, graphics, arts and so forth \u2014 that would\u2019ve previously absolutely required the Mac Pros of old, are being well-addressed by iMac. But there\u2019s still even further we can take iMac as a high performance, pro system, and we think that form factor can address even more of the pro market.\nWhat struck me about this is that Apple was framing a discussion in which the big news \u2014 the whole point, really \u2014 was their pre-announcing a \u201ccompletely rethought\u201d next-generation Mac Pro by emphasizing that most of their pro users use MacBooks and most of the rest use iMacs \u2014 and that they have big plans in store for the pro segment of both of those product lines. It\u2019s exactly what I would have expected Apple to say if they were breaking the news that the Mac Pro was going away: We\u2019re dropping the Mac Pro because its time has come and gone \u2014 all but a small percentage of our pro users have their needs met by MacBook Pros and high-end iMacs.\nSo it might seem curious for Apple to frame the need for an all-new Mac Pro by emphasizing just how many of their pro users don\u2019t need a Mac Pro. But if you think about it in the context of the current Mac Pro, it makes sense. Those whose needs aren\u2019t met by MacBook Pros or iMacs are people who need extreme performance. The current Mac Pro \u2014 even putting aside the age of its components \u2014 only met the needs of some of those users. For the rest \u2014 for those who need the fastest Intel CPUs on the market, the biggest and most powerful GPUs, etc. \u2014 the current Mac Pro isn\u2019t a good fit.\nThere were several questions from a few of us trying to peg down when Apple realized it needed to start over and design a new Mac Pro. Apple, unsurprisingly, wouldn\u2019t budge. But they were forthcoming about the fact that the current Mac Pro isn\u2019t meeting the needs of all the users who need a Mac Pro. Federighi:\nI think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will. We designed a system with the kind of GPUs that at the time we thought we needed, and that we thought we could well serve with a two GPU architecture. That that was the thermal limit we needed, or the thermal capacity we needed. But workloads didn\u2019t materialize to fit that as broadly as we hoped. Being able to put larger single GPUs required a different system architecture and more thermal capacity than that system was designed to accommodate. So it became fairly difficult to adjust. At the same time, so many of our customers were moving to iMac that we saw a path to address many, many more of those that were finding themselves limited by a Mac Pro through next generation iMac. And really put a lot of our energy behind that.\nSchiller:\nAs we\u2019ve said, we made something bold that we thought would be great for the majority of our Mac Pro users. And what we discovered was that it was great for some and not others. Enough so that we need to take another path. One of the good things, hopefully, with Apple through the years has been a willingness to say when something isn\u2019t quite what we wanted it to be, didn\u2019t live up to expectations, to not be afraid to admit it and look for the next answer.\nThe word \u201cmistake\u201d was not uttered, but this is about as close as we\u2019re going to get to Apple admitting they miscalculated with the current Mac Pro\u2019s concept. One word that was uttered, however, was \u201csorry\u201d. Here\u2019s Schiller, after being asked whether they already had an external design in mind for the next-gen Mac Pros:\nWe\u2019re not going to get into exactly what stage we\u2019re in, just that we told the team to take the time to do something really great. To do something that can be supported for a long time with customers with updates and upgrades throughout the years. We\u2019ll take the time it takes to do that. The current Mac Pro, as we\u2019ve said a few times, was constrained thermally and it restricted our ability to upgrade it. And for that, we\u2019re sorry to disappoint customers who wanted that, and we\u2019ve asked the team to go and re-architect and design something great for the future that those Mac Pro customers who want more expandability, more upgradability in the future. It\u2019ll meet more of those needs.\nMy takeaway is that the Mac\u2019s future is bright. Mac sales were up in 2016, once again outpacing the PC industry as a whole, and the new MacBook Pros are a hit, with sales up \u201cabout 20 percent\u201d year over year. The Mac is a $25 billion business for Apple annually, and according to the company there are 100 million people in the active Mac user base worldwide.\nYes, those numbers are all peanuts compared to the iPhone, but everything is peanuts compared to the iPhone.\nTernus put it plainly: \u201cSome of our most talented folks are working on [the Mac]. I mean, quite frankly, a lot of this company, if not most of this company, runs on Macs. This is a company full of pro Mac users.\u201d\nI asked whether Apple is aware of just how many serious Mac users have begun to doubt the company\u2019s commitment to the Mac in general, and the needs of pro Mac users in particular. Schiller said:\nIt\u2019s a reasonable question, and this is why we\u2019re here today, specifically, to address that question above all else. We\u2019re committed to the Mac, we\u2019ve got great talent on the Mac, both hardware and software, we\u2019ve got great products planned for the future, and as far as our horizon line can see, the Mac is a core component of the things Apple delivers, including to our pro customers.\nI think it was simply untenable for Apple to continue to remain silent on the Mac Pro front. No matter how disappointing you consider today\u2019s speed bump updates to the lineup, they\u2019re certainly better than no updates at all. But there was no way Apple could release today\u2019s speed bumps without acknowledging that in and of themselves, these updates do not suggest that Apple is committed to the Mac Pro. In fact, if they had released these speed bumps without any comment about the future of the Mac Pro, people would have reasonably concluded that Apple had lost its goddamned mind.\nUltimately, actions speak louder than words. But I very much like the words I heard yesterday.\nA few other miscellaneous tidbits from the discussion:",

        "body": "Production on the 2017 iPhone is moving along, with Apple recently having placed orders for 70 million OLED panels, reports Nikkei. Samsung, as we already know, will be Apple's sole OLED supplier, and will provide Apple with the panels.\nDemand for the 2017 iPhone, which is expected to feature a major design overhaul with an edge-to-edge display, glass body, and a premium price tag, is expected to be high as it typically is in a year when a new look is unveiled. Apple and Samsung are gearing up to meet demand with the large panel order.\n\"iPhone X\" concept via Gabor Balogh\nNikkei's info comes from a supply chain source and also matches with estimates provided by IHS Markit analyst David Hsieh.\n\"Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations,\" Hsieh said.\nThere have already been rumors suggesting the OLED iPhone will be in short supply when it launches in September, with the majority of the stock unavailable until later in the year, and Hsieh also believes that could be the case. \"It is also possible that some of these 70 million handsets will not be shipped to customers this year and be carried over to next year depending on demand,\" he said.\nNikkei's industry source, in addition to covering panel orders, also shared some details on the upcoming device that echoes many rumors we've heard in the past.\nThe site believes we will see a premium OLED iPhone with a 5.2-inch screen and no home button, which will be sold alongside standard 4.7 and 5.5-inch devices with LCD screens and home buttons. All three iPhones will include wireless charging functionality (lately said to be inductive) and waterproofing, while at least one model, presumably the OLED iPhone, will include a 3D sensor that supports facial recognition.\nOther features rumored for the iPhone 8 not mentioned in Nikkei's report include camera improvements, a faster and more efficient A11 processor, Touch ID built into the display, True Tone ambient light adjustment, and perhaps augmented reality functionality enabled through the camera.",

        "title": "Apple has a secret team working on the holy grail for treating diabetes",
        "body": "The efforts have been going on for at least five years, the people said. Jobs envisioned wearable devices, like smartwatches, being used to monitor important vitals, such as oxygen levels, heart rate and blood glucose. In 2010, Apple quietly acquired a company called Cor, after then-CEO Bob Messerschmidt reportedly sent Jobs a cold email on the topic of sensor technologies for health and wellness. Messerschmidt later joined the Apple Watch team.\nThe initiative is far enough along that Apple has been conducting feasibility trials at clinical sites across the Bay Area and has hired consultants to help it figure out the regulatory pathways, the people said.\nSuch a breakthrough would be a \"holy grail\" for life sciences. Many life sciences companies have tried and failed, as it's highly challenging to track glucose levels accurately without piercing the skin.\nApple has hired a small team of biomedical engineers to work at a nondescript office in Palo Alto, California, miles from corporate headquarters. They are part of a super secret initiative, initially envisioned by the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, to develop sensors that can noninvasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nThe glucose team is said to report to Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of hardware technologies. According to one of the sources, it was previously led by Michael D. Hillman, who left Apple in late 2015 and later joined Facebook 's Oculus as head of hardware. Hillman's LinkedIn page lists him as having had a \"confidential role\" in hardware technologies at Apple.\nOne person said about 30 people were working in this group as of a year ago. But speculation has been flying around since the company snapped up about a dozen biomedical experts from companies like Vital Connect, Masimo, Sano, Medtronic and C8 Medisensors. Some of these people joined the secretive team dedicated to glucose, sources said, while others are on Apple Watch team.\nOne of the people said that Apple is developing optical sensors, which involves shining a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose.\nAccurately detecting glucose levels has been such a challenge that one of the top experts in the space, John L. Smith, described it as \"the most difficult technical challenge I have encountered in my career.\" The space is littered with failures, as Smith points out, but that hasn't stopped companies from continuing to attempt to crack this elusive opportunity.\nTo succeed would cost a company \"several hundred millions or even a billion dollars,\" DexCom Executive Chairman Terrance Gregg previously told Reuters.\nThe breakthrough would be a boon for millions of people with diabetes, spur new medical research and open up a potential market for consumers to track their blood sugar for health and wellness insights. It could turn the Apple Watch into a \"must have\" rather than a \"nice to have\" for people who would benefit from an easier way to track their blood sugar.\nApple isn't the only technology company eyeing opportunities in the space. Verily, Google's life sciences team, is currently working on a \"smart\" contact lens to measure blood sugar via the eye, and it partnered up with DexCom in 2015 to develop a glucose-sensing device no bigger than a bandage.\nApple declined to comment.\nSee also:",

        "body": "Apple has been granted a permit that enables it to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in the state of California, according to the California DMV website (via Business Insider).\nApple was added to the list of permit holders that are allowed to participate in the Autonomous Vehicle Tester Program in California on Friday, joining companies like Google, Tesla, BMW, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and more.\nObtaining a permit for autonomous vehicle testing requires multiple steps, including outlining details for each specific vehicle being tested, suggesting Apple may have some sort of software test vehicle that's road ready. Whether Apple will actually begin testing a vehicle remains to be seen, as some companies sign up and then don't go on to use it, but should Apple begin vehicle testing, public reports will need to be filed.\nIn California, all companies that participate in the Autonomous Vehicle Testing Program must file Disengagement Reports that outline how many miles were covered with self-driving vehicles, so if Apple does test a vehicle, the information will be shared on the DMV's website.\nApple's acceptance into the Autonomous Vehicle Tester Program confirms the company's work on a car-related project. Early rumors suggested Apple was developing its own autonomous electric vehicle, but Apple is said to have since transitioned to building an autonomous driving system rather than a full blown car.\nDeveloped under the leadership of Bob Mansfield, Apple's autonomous driving system could allow it to partner with existing car makers or return to its own car development project in the future. Apple executives have reportedly given the car team until 2017 to prove the feasibility of an Apple-designed autonomous driving system, and its approval to road-test vehicles could be a signal that the project is advancing.\nUpdate: According to Bloomberg, Apple filed for a permit because it plans to start testing its self-driving car software platform on public streets. The software will be put in existing cars, with the permit covering three 2015 Lexus RX450h SUVs and six drivers, according to a DMV spokesperson.",

        "body": "Apple has fallen to fifth place in a Laptop Mag survey of the best and worst current laptop brands after previously taking the top spot for several years. Factors like premium price points and limited port options contribute to Apple\u2019s overall drop in the results, although Apple\u2019s quality tech support is a redeeming factor, the survey says.\nApple has taken the top spot since the survey started in 2010, so which brands outrank the MacBook in 2017? Lenovo takes the top spot followed by Asus, Dell, and HP. Acer tied Apple for fifth place.\nWhile the survey considers Apple\u2019s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models introduced last fall, it also channels common complaints that some had about the new machines.\nNamely that Apple raised the price of MacBook Pros with the new machines (and left versions of the old machines on the market without updating them to hit previous prices), replaced legacy I/O with USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 which is only now starting to become mainstream, and relied on the new Touch Bar for touch input versus a full-on touchscreen that many PC laptops offer.\nWhile Apple leads in design, tech support, and warranty coverage, overall reviews are hurt by so-called innovative features, overall price, and the number of laptop options from Apple.\nLaptop EIC Mark Spoonauer points to premium prices with hardware that makes working more difficult for pros and suggests Apple should reconsider its approach to pro notebook hardware similar to its revised roadmap for pro desktops.\nLast week Apple dropped its usual playbook to address concern over its focus on the professional desktop Mac space. Apple made the 2013 Mac Pro a slightly better value by offering higher end configs at existing prices. Apple is also working on a new modular Mac Pro and Apple-branded pro display that will ship sometime after this year, and new iMacs with pro configs are coming later this year.\nAs for the MacBook lineup, this year could potentially be a one-off blip for the survey results. Analysts predict MacBook prices will fall this year as second generation options add higher end configurations including 32GB RAM on 15-inch MacBook Pro models.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "iPhone 8 dummy model surfaces with edge-to-edge display, no rear Touch ID, and elongated power button",
        "body": "Update: New details at the bottom \u2026\nThe rumor mill for the iPhone 8 is seemingly flip-flopping between two distinct designs for Apple\u2019s 2017 flagship iPhone, one made of aluminium and another more drastic look with a curved glass front and back. The latest unverified leaks from today depict the latter device.\nThese photo show an iPhone made of glass and stainless steel with the front screen seemingly going edge-to-edge with no discernible bezel. There is also no Touch ID visible on the back, implying it will be integrated under the display. More photos after the jump \u2026\nThis latest round of leaks comes via Benjamin Geskin on Twitter. The photos are supposedly CNC dummy models of the iPhone 8 chassis. It isn\u2019t clear at what stage in the production process these models are from; the back Apple logo is missing from most of the photos.\nTaking the photos at face value for a moment, they do mostly gel with what we\u2019ve been hearing from other sources. Most interestingly, the back has a vertical rectangle for the new dual camera system \u2026 and nothing else.\nThere is no rear Touch ID fingerprint sensor in sight here, which implies that this design would see Apple integrating fingerprint biometric scanner into/underneath the display itself. This still remains a very contentious issue; can Apple integrate the fingerprint sensor into the display at scale?\nThe front of the device is dominated by the black screen which looks incredible with no discernible bezel (although again, it\u2019s not clear if this dummy includes screen components at all). The earpiece is just about visible at the top middle of the front; cutouts for cameras, proximity sensors and other parts are not distinguishable.\nThe sides of the device look like polished stainless steel, echoing an iPhone 4 aesthetic for sure. It almost looks like an iPod classic backplate with how shiny and curved it is. As you would expect, there are separate volume buttons and a mute switch on the left side. The right side looks a lot like a current iPhone too, with a power button and SIM tray, except the power switch seems to be elongated/longer.\nThe same leaker has also posted updated schematics, which show an array of components hidden underneath the front screen and the addition of a noise-reduction microphone in the dual-camera bulge. The red outline indicates where the bezel stops and the OLED display begins, approximately. These schematics imply that the display would feature a hole for the front speaker \u2026 one of the most unbelievable elements honestly.\nThese images are certainly very exciting, the device depicted here is a major upgrade over the current iPhone 7 design. However, we don\u2019t really have any concrete evidence that this is what the iPhone 8 will look like.\nIt certainly seems like it is one of the prototypes Apple considered but there\u2019s no \u2018smoking gun\u2019 to say it is the design the company is going to use. Bloomberg summarized the various prototypes Apple has considered for this year\u2019s flagship phone.\nWhilst the rumor mill remains divided on the iPhone 8 industrial design, the features of the phone seem locked down. Many reports indicate that the iPhone 8 (or whatever Apple ends up naming it) will feature a 3D sensing front camera, wireless charging, 3 GB RAM, 5.8-inch OLED 521 PPI display and more.\nApple will unveil the new phone in the fall alongside iterative updates to the existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models.\nUpdate: The same source has provided some more details: the iPhone 8 will supposedly be the same 7.1mm thinness and approximate physical size as the iPhone 7, and the steel surround will actually be a Space Black color. Geskin provided another image representing this Space Black finish:\nGeskin has also supplied a more detailed schematic showing the internal motherboard layout of the device, but says it is only 70% accurate \u2014 whatever that means.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "body": "Here's How the DOK Malware Works:\nDOK Deletes itself after Setting up Attacker's Proxy\n\"As a result of all of the above actions, when attempting to surf the web, the user's web browser will first ask the attacker web page on TOR for proxy settings,\" the researchers say.\n\"The user traffic is then redirected through a proxy controlled by the attacker, who carries out a Man-In-the-Middle attack and impersonates the various sites the user attempts to surf. The attacker is free to read the victim's traffic and tamper with it in any way they please.\"\nUpdate: Apple Revokes Certificate Used By Dok Mac Malware\nMalwareBytes has confirmed this in its blog post, which reads: \"Apple has already revoked the certificate used to sign the app, so, at this point, anyone who encounters this malware will be unable to open the app and unable to be infected by it.\"\nMany people believe that they are much less likely to be bothered by malware if they use a Mac computer, but is it really true? Unfortunately, No.According to the McAfee Labs , malware attacks on Apple's Mac computers were up 744% in 2016, and its researchers have discovered nearly 460,000 Mac malware samples, which is still just a small part of overall Mac malware out in the wild.Today, Malware Research team at CheckPoint have discovered a new piece of fully-undetectable Mac malware, which according to them, affects all versions of Mac OS X, has zero detections on VirusTotal and is \"signed with a valid developer certificate (authenticated by Apple).\"Dubbed, the malware is being distributed via a coordinated email phishing campaign and, according to the researchers, is the first major scale malware to target macOS users.The malware has been designed to gain administrative privileges and install a new root certificate on the target system, which allows attackers to intercept and gain complete access to all victim communication, including SSL encrypted traffic.Just almost three months ago, Malwarebytes researchers also discovered a rare piece of Mac-based espionage malware , dubbed, that was used to spy on biomedical research center computers and remained undetected for years.The malware is distributed via a phishing email masquerading as a message regarding supposed inconsistencies in their tax returns, tricking the victims into running an attached malicious .zip file, which contains the malware.Since the malware author is using a valid developer certificate signed by Apple, the malware easily bypasses-- an inbuilt security feature of the macOS operating system by Apple. Interestingly, the DOK malware is also undetectable in almost all antivirus products.Once installed, the malware copies itself to the /Users/Shared/ folder and then add to \"loginItem\" in order to make itself persistent, allowing it to execute automatically every time the system reboots, until it finishes to install its payload.The malware then creates a window on top of all other windows, displaying a message claiming that a security issue has been identified in the operating system and an update is available, for which the user has to enter his/her password.Once the victim installed the update, the malware gains administrator privileges on the victim's machine and changes the victim system's network settings, allowing all outgoing connections to pass through a proxy.CheckPoint researchers,The malware then installs a new root certificate in the infected Mac, which allows the attacker to intercept the victim's traffic using a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack.According to researchers, almost no antivirus has updated its signature database to detect the DOK OS X malware, as the malware deletes itself once it modifies proxy settings on the target machines for interceptions.Apple can resolve this issue just by revoking the developer certificate being abused by the malware author.Meanwhile, users are always recommended to avoid clicking links contained in messages or emails from untrusted sources and always pay extra attention before proving your root password.After this story had gone up, Apple responded to the issue and revoked the legitimate developer certificate used by hackers behind the DOK malware that can be used to eavesdrop on victim's communication, including secure HTTPS traffic.It further adds: \"If the user clicks past this warning to open the app, it will display a warning that the file could not be opened, which is simply a cover for the fact that no document opened, as shown above.\"Besides this, Apple also rolled out an update this weekend to its XProtect built-in anti-malware software in an attempt to prevent existing and future DOK-type malware attacks.",

        "title": "Apple Points to VR as One Reason Why Next Mac Pro Needs to be More Powerful",
        "body": "709 SHARES Facebook Twitter Linkedin Reddit\nAt present, modern VR headsets are for the most part unsupported on Apple computers, largely because many of the company\u2019s computers do not meet the recommended hardware specifications. Apple may rarely hint at it, but the company is thinking about VR\u2026 and so are its customers. Recently Apple has admitted that the current Mac Pro isn\u2019t standing up to the needs of some of its customers, and VR is one reason why.\n\u201cWe are in the process of what we call \u2018completely rethinking\u2019 the Mac Pro,\u201d Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s SVP of Worldwide Marketing told TechCrunch last week.\nApple had introduced the current cylindrical Mac Pro back in 2013, an impressively compact device which aimed to replace those big silver Mac Pro towers of years past. But the design, which features by default dual graphics cards, was built on the idea that multi-GPU architecture would become the norm for high-power computing. However, while the usage of the dedicated GPU has grown since then, most applications remain optimized to render on one big (and hot) GPU.\nThat\u2019s become a sticky problem for the Mac Pro, which has a neat triangular cooling architecture\u2014with a CPU on one side and a GPU on the other two\u2014that was designed for even heat distribution on each face, but the nature of largely single-GPU optimized applications means the system reaches a thermal bottleneck before it can reach its maximum performance (which would require distributing the GPU load effectively across both GPUs).\n\u201cI think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will,\u201d says Apple\u2019s SVP of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, as reported by TechCrunch. \u201cWe designed a system that we thought with the kind of GPUs that at the time we thought we needed, and that we thought we could well serve with a two GPU architecture\u2026 that that was the thermal limit we needed, or the thermal capacity we needed. But workloads didn\u2019t materialize to fit that as broadly as we hoped.\u201d\nWhen asked by TechCrunch\u2019s Matthew Panzarino what sorts of high-power computing tasks are being held back by the present design, Apple brought VR into view.\n\u201cThere\u2019s certain scientific loads that are very GPU intensive and they want to throw the largest GPU at it that they can,\u201d says Federighi. \u201cThere are heavy 3D graphics [applications] or graphics and compute mixed loads. Those can be in VR, those can be in certain kinds of high-end cinema production tasks where most of the software out there that\u2019s been written to target those doesn\u2019t know how to balance itself well across multiple GPUs but can scale across a single large GPU.\u201d\nIndeed, while NVIDIA and AMD both offer support for using more than one GPU for VR rendering, few developers are optimizing VR applications for a dual GPU architecture.\nAnd so Apple is committing to bringing a new Mac Pro into the world, one that will better scale with the needs of its customers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on it,\u201d says Schiller. \u201cWe have a team working hard on it right now, and we want to architect it so that we can keep it fresh with regular improvements, and we\u2019re committed to making it our highest-end, high-throughput desktop system, designed for our demanding pro customers.\u201d\nGranted, the company says that major refresh won\u2019t come until sometime after 2017.\nBack in the days of the Rift DK2 development kit, Oculus for the most part supported Apple computers. But in 2015 announced it was \u2018pausing\u2019 software development for Mac and Linux to focus on Windows as the only compatible platform for the consumer launch of the Rift.\nIn 2016, Oculus ex-founder Palmer Luckey said that Oculus would be happy to support MacOS \u201cif they ever release a [high performance] computer.\u201d He talked about the Mac Pro specifically:\nIt just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn\u2019t prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top-of-the-line AMD FirePro D700 and it still doesn\u2019t match our recommended spec. If they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day\u2026 we\u2019d love to support Mac. But right now there\u2019s just not a single machine out there [from Apple] that supports it. So even if we can support on the software side, there\u2019s just no audience of [Mac users] that can run the vast majority of [VR] software out there.\nBetween Oculus and HTC/Valve, the companies have largely agreed to a \u2018recommended VR spec\u2019 which today means an Intel Core i5-4590 equivalent and an NVIDIA GTX 1060 or Radeon RX 480 equivalent.\nWill the new Mac Pro be VR ready? Apple\u2019s recent words seem to indicate the answer is yes when it comes to hardware, but the company and its MacOS will still need support from other ecosystem players to achieve software compatibility.",

        "title": "iPhone 8 mass production delayed to October/November",
        "body": "We\u2019ve been hearing several reports that the launch of the iPhone 8 could be delayed compared to previous years. Reputable Apple analyst KGI Ming-Chi Kuo has also weighed in today, reporting that mass production of the OLED iPhone will likely be pushed back to October/November, instead of the normal August/September timeframe for new iPhone launches.\nKGI says the reason for the production difficulties is that the new iPhone 8 includes several major cutting-edge components that Apple has custom-ordered. The analyst still expects the iterative \u20187S\u2019 models to launch on the normal schedule \u2026\nKGI says that a delay of one to two months for the production ramp of iPhone 8 will hurt Apple\u2019s calendar 2017 sales as customers will want to wait for the shiny new device to be available.\nIt will also mean Apple faces stiff competition from Android manufacturers for a longer period, as its rivals launch bezel-less devices across the year.\nThat being said, Apple is unlikely to lose too many sales if looking longer-term. Most customers who want the new iPhone will simply buy it when it is finally available even if that means early 2018.\nKGI blames several \u2018significant hardware upgrades\u2019 in the iPhone 8 for the delays. This includes a custom OLED display panel, a custom Apple A11 10-nanometer SoC, an all-new designed 3D Touch module and 3D sensing cameras.\nWe\u2019ve heard about all of these features before, of course. The rumour mill still isn\u2019t sure what the new iPhone will look like, although images leaked over the weekend depicting a potential final design.\nKGI expects severe supply shortages for the OLED phone \u201cfor a while\u201d after launch, limiting total iPhone shipments for 2017.\nMoreover, KGI has a more pessimistic outlook about the iPhone 7s models (iterative updates to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with internal component upgrades contained in the same chassis design) than before. Full-screen smartphones from Samsung, Huawei and Xiaomi will make Apple\u2019s lower-end phones less appealing.\nBefore the news about production problems, KGI expected new iPhone shipments (comprising the 7s, 7s Plus and the iPhone 8) to reach 110 million units in the second half of 2017. With the OLED iPhone availability set to be very limited, it has reduced his estimates to 80-90 million units.\nApple is expected to announce all the new iPhones in the fall. The iterative iPhone 7s models will likely launch in September, keeping up with the annual pattern. Apple will probably announce the 7s and radical new OLED iPhone at the same media event regardless. However, it seems fans wanting the all-new phone will have to wait a bit longer to get their hands on the iPhone 8.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "Walt Mossberg is Retiring This June :(",
        "body": "It was a June day when I began my career as a national journalist. I stepped into the Detroit Bureau of The Wall Street Journal and started on what would be a long, varied, rewarding career. I was 23 years old, and the year was 1970. That\u2019s not a typo.\nSo it seems fitting to me that I\u2019ll be retiring this coming June, almost exactly 47 years later. I\u2019ll be hanging it up shortly after the 2017 edition of the Code Conference, a wonderful event I co-founded in 2003 and which I could never have imagined back then in Detroit.\nI didn\u2019t make this decision lightly or hastily or under pressure. It emerged from months of thought and months of talks with my wise wife, my family, and close friends. It wasn\u2019t prompted by my employer or by some dire health diagnosis. It just seems like the right time to step away. I\u2019m ready for something new.\nOver my career, I\u2019ve reinvented myself numerous times. I covered the Pentagon, the State Department, and the CIA. I wrote about labor wars, trade wars, and real wars. I chronicled a nuclear plant meltdown and the defeat of communism. I co-founded a couple of media businesses.\nAnd, in the best professional decision of my life, I converted myself into a tech columnist in 1991. As a result, I got to bear witness to a historic parade of exciting, revolutionary innovation \u2014 from slow, clumsy, ancient PCs to sleek, speedy smartphones; from CompuServe and early AOL to the mobile web, apps, and social media. My column has run weekly in a variety of places over the years, most recently on The Verge and Recode under the Vox Media umbrella, where I\u2019ve been quite happy and have added a podcast of which I\u2019m proud.\nSo I see retirement as just another of these reinventions, another chance to do new things and be a new version of myself.\nI will likely write a bit more about this before I stop. But, for now, I just want to thank you for reading, viewing, and listening to me over the years, and for letting me know when you thought me right or crazy.\nI want to thank Vox Media, The Verge, Recode, The Wall Street Journal, and CNBC for giving me a voice. And, to name just a few individuals, I want to thank some indispensable career partners along the way: Kara Swisher, Norm Pearlstine, Paul Steiger, Larry O\u2019Donnell, Jim Bankoff, Nilay Patel, Lia Lorenzano-Kennett, Stephanie Capparell, and Katie Boehret.\nI\u2019m not going anywhere for a while, so you\u2019ll still be seeing my columns, TV appearances, and podcasts this month and next. I will enjoy creating every one of them, just as I enjoyed writing those stories from Detroit in 1970.",

        "body": "The numbers for the iPad aren\u2019t good. Revenue and unit sales were both down again, as usual. But that does not mean Apple has given up on its tablet.\nFirst Apple fleshed out the product line with two high-end iPad Pro models. Now it has gone and built a low-end version, with a fairly big 9.7-inch screen, a recent A9 chip, and a minimum of 32GB of storage.\nMost importantly, it\u2019s got a low, low starting price: $329. That price is so important to the identity of this product that it\u2019s mentioned on its online product description page as if it were a feature. The only other modern Apple device that has that characteristic is the MacBook Air, which was last updated two years ago and now serves as the bottom of the Mac laptop lineup, given the arrival of the 12-inch MacBook and the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.\nApple ran this same playbook last year, when it introduced the iPhone SE, a throwback to the cute 4-inch 2013 iPhone 5S. The SE, at $399, is the poor man\u2019s iPhone, if such a thing is possible. Demand exceeded supply for the first two quarters following its release, suggesting that people had been eager for a cheaper Apple phone for some time.\nNow we have the 2017 iPad, which looks essentially the same as the iPad Air 2 from 2014. Generally speaking, it has performed well for the price in my early testing. Is it as zippy as the iPad Pro? No. Can you use the great Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard with this thing? No. Does it come in pink rose gold? Nah.\nWhat you have here is a good enough iPad available on the cheap. Apple wouldn\u2019t be coming out with this product if it didn\u2019t think the value proposition would resonate. The iPhone SE has succeeded in getting people to switch from Android, and this new iPad could do the same.\nAnd it\u2019s not only that. Particularly in the education market, which Apple has focused on with the Mac in the past, the new iPad could take some market share from Chromebooks. Google\u2019s partners have put out many low-end models, and now Apple has a better response to that challenge.\nRegardless of whether you\u2019re in the classroom, though, a lower-priced iPad could make you more willing to spend money on accessories, like cases, keyboards, and stylii \u2014 because the price of everything simply won\u2019t be as staggeringly high. That might be exactly what Apple wants.\nThe question is whether this is all enough to make the iPad business grow beyond its high point in 2013.",

        "title": "The Hot New Hip-Hop Producer Who Does Everything on His iPhone",
        "body": "A few minutes after Steve Lacy arrived at a dingy, weed-clouded recording studio in Burbank, the 18-year-old musician flopped down in a plush leather chair in the control room. Vince, one of the studio's proprietors, came in to show Lacy how the mixing boards and monitors worked. Lacy didn't care; he was just in it for the chair. He picked up his new black-and-white Rickenbacker guitar, then reached into his Herschel backpack and yanked out a mess of cables. Out of the mess emerged his iRig, an interface adapter that connects his guitar directly into his iPhone 6. He shoved it into the Lightning port and began tuning his instrument, staring at the GarageBand pitch meter through the cracks on the screen of his phone.\nLacy's smartphone has been his personal studio since he first started making music.\nGuitar ready, Lacy relocated into the studio. He usually works in the vocal booth, where he'll light candles and hang for hours, but since I had a cameraman with me he agreed to sit somewhere a little more visually appealing\u2014and bigger. Lacy, wearing jean shorts and a plaid khaki shirt underneath an unzipped blue hoodie, sat on a drum throne in the center of the studio and re-assumed his previous pose: right leg crossed over left, Beats headphones on his ears, iPhone perched precariously on his bare knee (he swears this isn't how he cracked the screen) and connected to the guitar in his lap. Then he went to work, kind of. He'd never call it work. He doesn't even call it recording, or songwriting, or producing. He calls it \"making beats.\"\nIt's a weird recording setup, but it's working for Lacy. Last year, he was nominated for a Grammy for executive-producing and performing on the 2015 funk-R&B-soul album Ego Death, the third release from The Internet and Lacy's first with the band. He's a sought-after producer, featured on albums like J. Cole's \"4 Your Eyez Only\" and Kendrick Lamar's new \"Damn.\" Earlier in 2017, he released his first solo material, which he's playing as part of the setlist for The Internet's worldwide tour. (Somewhere in there he also graduated high school.) The only connection between his many projects? All that music is stored on his iPhone.\nThat night in Burbank, Lacy had no real agenda or deadline. It was just a brainstorm, a jam session. He paged through the drum presets in GarageBand for a while before picking a messy-sounding kit. With two thumbs, he tapped out a simple beat, maybe 30 seconds long. Then he went back to the Rickenbacker. He played a riff he'd stumbled on while tuning, recording it on a separate GarageBand track over top of the drums. Without even playing it back, Lacy then reached down and deleted it. It took three taps: stop, delete, back to the beginning. He played the riff again, subtly differently. Deleted it again. For the next half hour, that's all Lacy did: play, tap-tap-tap, play again. He experimented wildly for a while, then settled on a loose structure and began subtly tweaking it. Eventually satisfied with that bit, he plugged in his Fender bass and started improvising a bassline. A few hours later, he began laying vocals, a breathy, wordless melody he sang directly into the iPhone's microphone. He didn't know quite what he was making, but he was feeling it.\nAll night, Lacy goofed around. He found a sword in the studio, and made up a shockingly catchy song called \"Sword in the Studio\" that's still rattling around in my brain. He paused every few minutes to snack on Sour Patch watermelons or let out a deafening burp. Occasionally, when I asked him a question, he'd respond with a British accent. He paced around the room, took a call from his mom, and joked with his manager, David Airaudi. And even when he'd get back to making beats, it still looked more like play.\nLacy's smartphone has been his personal studio since he first started making music. Even now, with all the equipment and access he could want, he still feels indelibly connected to something about making songs piece by piece on his phone. He's also working this way to prove a point: that tools don't really matter. He feelds a tension that's been part of the music industry since the Tascam 424 Portastudio made mobile recording easy in the 80s, and has come up time and again since then. He wants to remind people that the performance, the song, the feeling matter more than the gear you use to record it. If you want to make something, Lacy tells me, grab whatever you have and just make it. If it's good, people will notice. Maybe even Kendrick Lamar.\nDamien Maloney for WIRED\nThe Accidental Grammy Nominee\nOne of Lacy's earliest music memories comes from fifth grade or so. This was circa 2009, when Jerkin' was the new dance craze. At school in Torrance, California, a bunch of eighth-graders would tell him to grab two pens and tap out beats while they jerked. \"I was so honored,\" he says, \"because they were the cool kids!\" He quickly learned to use erasable pens, which are plastic, because the glass ones would break and get ink all over his hands. He also learned he had a knack for making beats, though everyone else seemed to know that already.\nSince it's all in his pocket, Lacy is ready to play his stuff at any time. Which was particularly handy last fall, when Lacy found himself in the studio with Kendrick Lamar.\nWhen Lacy and I first met, on the Venice beach a few hours before heading to the studio, he seemed to be thinking about his musical history for the first time. (He was also distracted by the half-finished cheetah tattoo on his abs, which itched like crazy.) Most of his stories go the same way: our young protagonist shows up, goofs around, and something magical happens. Like when Jameel Bruner, a high school senior when Lacy was a freshman, took Lacy under his wing. Bruner played keys; Lacy had learned guitar and bass. \"He puts me on all this new music,\" Lacy says of Bruner. \"I looked up to him a lot. On keys, that man? Crazy. Playing with him felt so good.\"\nLEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to the iPhone\nBruner started bringing Lacy around to a Hollywood recording studio in 2014, where he was working on a new album with his band, The Internet. Lacy watched and learned, seeing the production process first-hand. Then one day, Matt Martians, one of The Internet's founding members, needed a bass player. Bruner said, hey, Steve plays bass. \"And we get to the studio,\" Lacy says, \"and we're just instantly making bangers.\" Much of what Lacy and Martians made in those early sessions wound up on Ego Death, but at the time Lacy just thought he was jamming. \"When people ask how it felt to know you're co-executive producing an album,\" Lacy tells me, \"I'm like, I didn't know?\"\nIt was only after Ego Death got a Best Urban Contemporary Album Grammy nom that Lacy decided a music career was for him. (Some signs are hard to ignore.) But he was going to school in Harbor City, 25 miles and untold traffic away from the Hollywood studio. He didn't own a laptop, either. But he did have a phone. He jailbroke his iPhone, which gave him access to an app called Bridge that could save songs straight from the internet. He also tore through the App Store, experimenting with iMachine, BeatMaker 2, iMPC, GarageBand, and others. Mostly he started making beats all the time. At home. While driving. In class. Once outside a barbershop, when there were a bunch of people ahead of him in line and he had a hook idea in his head. Lots of musicians use voice memos to record and remember snippets of songs, of course. It's just that for Lacy, the stuff stayed on his phone. He'd build tracks in pieces, then put them together and upload to Soundcloud or Tumblr. At first, nobody was really listening, but song by song, beat by beat, he gained a following.\nDamien Maloney for WIRED\nMaking music on his phone is mostly about the simplicity, the convenience. It's a little about skipping the traffic on the way to the studio. But there's one other advantage: since it's all in his pocket, Lacy is ready to play his stuff at any time. Which was particularly handy last fall, when Lacy found himself in the studio with Kendrick Lamar.\nNormally, Lacy does all his dealing artist-to-artist. He'll DM other musicians who follow him on Twitter, or just call them. But he got to Lamar a slightly more traditional way: through producer DJ Dahi, who he met thanks to Vampire Weekend frontman Ezra Koenig. Dahi, Lacy says, \"brought me in to see Kendrick just to make some beats with him, just work on some ideas.\" At one point, as things naturally do, the room got quiet. Everyone was on their phones, nothing was really happening. So Lacy pipes up. \"Let me play you some stuff,\" he told Lamar. That's how Lacy likes to work\u2014not jumping straight to collaborating, just playing everyone what he's working on. If they're into it, great. If not, no worries.",

        "title": "iPhone 8 Pre-Orders Still Expected in September, But Shipments Likely Delayed Until 'Several Weeks Later'",
        "body": "Apple's widely rumored trio of new iPhones, including traditional 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models and an all-new 5.8-inch model with an OLED display, will likely be available to pre-order in September, but deliveries of the 5.8-inch model will not begin until \"several weeks later,\" says longtime Apple analyst Brian White.\nAn excerpt from White's research note with investment banking firm Drexel Hamilton, obtained by MacRumors:\nOur contact strongly believes the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges around the 3D sensing technology, but still in time for the December holidays. This is not the first time that we've heard about a potential delay with a new iPhone; however, our contact was so emphatic about the delay that we are taking this data point more seriously. Since it is only April, this situation could improve. Essentially, our contact believes customers will be able to pre-order the new 5.8-inch iPhone 8 along with the new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhones in September; however, the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will not be available for delivery until several weeks later.\nWhite, who is currently in Taiwan to garner information from Apple's supply chain, cited a \"smartphone contact\" who is \"diligently following the supply chain data points\" around the tentatively named \"iPhone 8\" as the source of his information, so it's not a completely baseless prediction.\nIn fact, White's prediction lines up exactly with recent supply chain information gathered by the research arm of Barclays. The bank similarly expects Apple's first iPhone with an OLED display to launch in September, but it believes the majority of stock may not be available until later in the fourth quarter.\nTogether, the predictions suggest that shipping estimates for Apple's tenth-anniversary iPhone, which has been variously dubbed the iPhone 8, iPhone X, iPhone Pro, or iPhone Edition, could slip to several weeks out just minutes after pre-orders begin, much like the iPhone 7 Plus in Jet Black last year.\nAs usual, it might be hard to get your hands on the highest-end iPhone prior to the holidays, but it likely won't be impossible.\nChinese-language Economic Daily News recently said the \"iPhone 8\" might not launch whatsoever until October or November, as suppliers are supposedly encountering \"technical issues\" related to the display lamination process, while challenges exist in integrating the 3D sensing front camera system.\nHowever, of the two scenarios, it seems more likely that at least some quantities of the \"iPhone 8\" will be available to pre-order in September alongside the tentatively named iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus.",

        "title": "New report claims the iPhone 8 will actually cost less than $1,000",
        "body": "It has been widely reported that the upcoming iPhone 8 will cost consumers over $1000 at retail because of new features such as the OLED display and new 3D sensors. A new investor note from UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, however, disputes earlier reports and says the iPhone 8 will come in for less than $1000.\nAccording to Milunovich (via CNBC), the iPhone 8 will still come at a premium compared to the current iPhone lineup, but not as much of a premium as once thought. He claims that the factory cost of the 64GB iPhone 8 will be $70 to $90 higher than the equivalent iPhone 7s Plus model (presumably the 32GB variant). Thus, Milunovich claims the device will come with a sticker price between $850 and $900 for consumers.\nCurrently, the 32GB iPhone 7 Plus comes in at $769 at full retail price, so a base price of $850 or even $900 is not that significant of a change for consumers. Furthermore, the price hike would further increase the average selling price of the iPhone, something that will surely please investors.\nMilunovich expects the radically different iPhone 8 to see a \u201cbulge of buying.\u201d He specifically believes that the OLED iPhone 8 will account for 45 percent of shipments during fiscal 2018.\n\u201cApple customers seem fine with paying more for products they feel are differentiated,\u201d Milunovich noted, adding that the OLED model could account for 45 percent of shipments in fiscal 2018.\nAs for how the iPhone 8 is expected to compare to Samsung\u2019s latest Galaxy S8 flagship, Milunovich says that despite the \u201cdisplay size disadvantage\u201d to the Galaxy S8, the iPhone 8 will feature a variety of things that will set it apart.\n\u201cApple\u2019s top model will be at a display size disadvantage to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8 Plus. We still think Apple will choose to price its top model relative to Samsung\u2019s top model, but remain cautious on how much higher Apple could ultimately go on price given a smaller display,\u201d Milunovich wrote. \u201cOffsetting this display size differential is the fact that the OLED iPhone could have features not included in the Galaxy S8 Plus, such as a front facing 3D sensing camera, embedded fingerprint sensor and higher quality facial recognition.\u201d The iPhone 8 is expected to be unveiled later this year. Keep up with everything we\u2019re expecting the device to feature here.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Qualcomm sues Apple for hobbling its iPhone chips to make Intel look better",
        "body": "After Apple hit Qualcomm with a barrage of lawsuits earlier this year, the chipmaker is countersuing Apple right back. Qualcomm today filed its Answers and Counterclaims to Apple\u2019s January lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of California. The full details of the suit can be read in a 139-page document (PDF) released by Qualcomm, but the company has five key complaints \u2014 including the claim that Apple deliberately didn\u2019t use the full potential of Qualcomm chips in iPhone 7 phones so that they wouldn\u2019t perform better than the modems provided by Intel.\nQualcomm says that Apple \u201cchose not to utilize certain high-performance features of the Qualcomm chipsets for the iPhone 7 (preventing consumers from enjoying the full extent of Qualcomm\u2019s innovation),\u201d and when Qualcomm iPhones supposedly outperformed Intel iPhones, \u201cApple falsely claimed that there was \u2018no discernible difference\u2019 between\u201d the two variants.\nApple sued Qualcomm in January\nThe company also says that Apple prevented it from revealing to customers \u201cthe extent to which iPhones with Qualcomm\u2019s chipsets outperformed iPhones with Intel\u2019s chipsets.\u201d As part of its five core arguments, Qualcomm says Apple \u201cthreatened\u201d it to keep quiet about the differences between Intel and Qualcomm iPhones, preventing Qualcomm from \u201cmaking any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones.\u201d\nOther complaints in the countersuit include claims that Apple breached and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm, encouraged attacks on the company in a number of markets by misrepresenting facts and making false statements, and interfered with Qualcomm\u2019s existing agreements with other companies.\nApple\u2019s original suit against Qualcomm was filed in January this year in the United States, and claimed $1 billion from the chipmaker, arguing that it had been drastically overcharging for the use of patents. That was followed up by two additional suits \u2014 one in China and one in the United Kingdom \u2014 that also focused on patents and designs. A case filed in Beijing claimed 1 billion yuan ($145 million) for Qualcomm\u2019s abuse of China\u2019s monopoly laws.\nTim Cook said that Apple had \u201cno choice\u201d but to sue Qualcomm, even after the two companies had worked together for many years, saying that he and his company \u201cdidn\u2019t see another way forward.\u201d According to Cook, Qualcomm was \u201cinsisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with,\u201d collecting money on features like Apple\u2019s TouchID fingerprint readers and cameras.\nQualcomm says Apple threatened it to stop it from comparing iPhones\nThe Apple suits came after the Federal Trade Commission filed its own litigation against Qualcomm in January. The FTC also took umbrage against Qualcomm\u2019s use of its patents: specifically, how it wouldn\u2019t sell modems to companies who didn\u2019t also agree to pay royalties on phones that didn\u2019t use Qualcomm modems. As part of the FTC\u2019s case, some of the chipmaker\u2019s other behind-the-scenes deals also came to light \u2014 including a 2007 agreement with Apple that saw Qualcomm refund some patent royalties if Apple promised not to make a WiMAX phone.",

The half-gallon of synthetic sweat Cupertino pumps out every single day to see how well its products withstand the day-to-day rigors of real-world use. Yes, really!\nThe intriguing tidbit was shared by Vice journalist Arielle Duhaime-Ross as part of an article exploring Apple\u2019s environmental efforts.\nOn Monday, Duhaime-Ross visited Apple HQ, where she was shown Apple Watch cases and AirPods placed in containers filled with synthetic human sweat to make sure they\u2019re safe to wear over long periods of time.\nhttps://twitter.com/ArielleDRoss/status/854845028728020992\nApple synthetic sweat testing\nTo be clear, Apple\u2019s doing nothing fundamentally different here. Sweat testing is used in many, many different manufacturing sectors, ranging from jewelry and clothing to cosmetics, leather manufacturers and credit card companies.\nSuch tests allow companies to test products for possible harmful or unsightly corrosion, or to test the \u201ccolorfastness\u201d of dyes and materials used in the production process.\nThere are even companies like Pickering Laboratories in Mountain View, California, that specialize in working out perfect formulas for synthetic sweat.

        "body": "Apple could delay its rumored high-end iPhone with a 5.8-inch edge-to-edge OLED display until October or even November, according to a new report out on Wednesday.\nIn recent years, Apple has released its iPhone updates in September, but according to Chinese-language Economic Daily News (EDN), suppliers are encountering \"technical issues\" in the production of the upcoming \"iPhone 8\" because of differences in the display lamination process and challenges involved in integrating the 3D sensing front camera system.\nThe report tallies with a rumor that circulated last month suggesting the iPhone 8 may go on sale later than usual, due to the switch to an OLED display and the new technology needed. In such a scenario, the launch of an iPhone 7s and 7s Plus would go ahead in September as scheduled, with the higher-end iPhone 8 coming later in the year.\nSuch a staggered release would be highly untypical of Apple, and it's hard to imagine the company holding a September launch event for \"S\" cycle iPhones with no mention of the highly rumored OLED device. However, it is possible the higher-end phone could be revealed at the same time but launched in limited quantities or at a later date. Barclays analysts recently claimed that Apple will launch its \"10th anniversary iPhone\" in the usual September timeframe, albeit in short supply until a full stock arrives in the fourth quarter.\nEarlier this week it was reported that Apple has placed an order for 70 million OLED panels from Samsung, anticipating high demand. Samsung is preparing to be able to produce up to 95 million panels in 2017, said the sources.\nMarket watchers are said to be analyzing the pull-in of orders for passive components from the iPhone's supply chain to see whether production of the new iPhone devices is on track, according to EDN. Apart from the edge-to-edge OLED display, the \"iPhone 8\" is expected to include wireless charging, no physical Home button, and perhaps 3D facial recognition and/or iris scanning. In addition, rumors suggest that Touch ID could be embedded in or under a True Tone display.\n(Via DigiTimes.)",
