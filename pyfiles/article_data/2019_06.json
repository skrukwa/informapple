        "title": "Jony Ive, iPhone designer, announces Apple departure",
        "body": "Jony Ive is leaving Apple after more than two decades in which his iconic designs for the Mac, iPod and iPhone turned one of Silicon Valley\u2019s faded giants into the world\u2019s most valuable company and defined a generation of consumer products.\nSir Jonathan is setting up his own new venture, a creative business called LoveFrom, with Apple as its first client. The transition will begin later this year, with LoveFrom launching fully in 2020.\n\u201cWhile I will not be an [Apple] employee, I will still be very involved \u2014 I hope for many, many years to come,\u201d Sir Jonathan told the FT in an exclusive interview. \u201cThis just seems like a natural and gentle time to make this change.\u201d\nThe departure of the world\u2019s most famous industrial designer and the custodian of the entire Apple aesthetic \u2014 from its hardware and software to its physical architecture \u2014 will come as a shock to its investors and customers. Many see Sir Jonathan as one of its most crucial assets as it looks beyond the iPhone into a new phase of products and services.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, sought to play down the changes as an \u201cevolution\u201d, pointing to an expanded group of in-house designers that is \u201cthe strongest it\u2019s ever been\u201d.\n\u201cWe get to continue with the same team that we\u2019ve had for a long time and have the pleasure of continuing to work with Jony,\u201d Mr Cook told the FT. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a better result.\u201d\nMore coverage Jony Ive and Tim Cook spoke exclusively to the Financial Times about the shake-up at the top of Apple. See more FT analysis in the box at the bottom of this article.\nNonetheless, news of another leadership change so soon after retail chief Angela Ahrendts left in April, at a time when trade tensions between the US and China have destabilised iPhone sales, brings yet more uncertainty for Apple investors after a tumultuous first half of 2019.\nSir Jonathan, who was knighted by the Queen in 2012, has provided vital continuity for Apple\u2019s strategic vision since the death of its co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011 and is seen by some observers of the company as more important than Mr Cook to its pipeline of future innovations.\nNo immediate successor\nNo immediate successor will take Sir Jonathan\u2019s title of chief design officer, which he has held since 2015. Alan Dye, who oversees Apple\u2019s user interface team, and Evans Hankey, who now leads industrial design, will report to Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, who also played a key role in the development of Apple Watch.\nLittle is known about LoveFrom but Sir Jonathan has ambitious plans for his new business, which he said would be based in California \u201cfor now\u201d. Marc Newson, a longstanding friend and collaborator who became part of Apple\u2019s design team in 2014, will also join the new firm, alongside what Sir Jonathan called \u201ca collection of creatives\u201d spanning several different disciplines beyond design.\nWhile he would not be drawn on the full extent of LoveFrom\u2019s work, Sir Jonathan said that he would continue to work on wearable technology and healthcare, two of Apple\u2019s strategic priorities, as well as various \u201cpersonal passions\u201d. Apple will retain LoveFrom for design services relating to a variety of unspecified projects but LoveFrom will also take on other clients.\n\u201cThere are products that we have been working on for a number of years,\u201d he said of his continuing work at Apple. \u201cI\u2019m beyond excited that I get to continue working on those, and there are some new projects as well that I\u2019ll get to develop and contribute to.\u201d",

        "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook warned that Silicon Valley companies needed to take responsibility for the \"chaos\" they create in a speech Sunday at Stanford University.\nAlthough Cook did not mention companies by name, his commencement speech in Silicon Valley's backyard mentioned data breaches, privacy violations, and even made reference to Theranos, a disgraced startup.\n\"Lately it seems this industry is becoming better known for a less noble innovation \u2013 the belief you can claim credit without accepting responsibility,\" Cook said. \"We see it every day now with every data breach, every privacy violation, every blind eye turned to hate speech, fake news poisoning out national conversation, the false miracles in exchange for a single drop of your blood.\"\nHe continued: \"It feels a bit crazy that anyone should have to say this, but if you built a chaos factory, you can't dodge responsibility for the chaos.\"\nIt's the latest in a series of speeches from Cook in which he has has discussed his views on data security while criticizing Google, Facebook, and other technology companies for their approach to user data and privacy, usually without naming those companies. Apple advertises privacy as a key iPhone feature and recently released a privacy-focused sign-on feature that competes with Google and Facebook .\nCook told the new Stanford graduates that digital surveillance threatened innovation and would have \"stopped Silicon Valley before it got started.\"\n\"If we accept as normal and unavoidable that everything in our lives can be aggregated, sold and even leaked in the event of a hack, then we lose so much more than data. We lose the freedom to be human,\" Cook said in the commencement speech.\nThe rest of the speech touched on themes including how to leave a legacy and advice to the students on how to follow their own paths.\nIn January, Cook called for a Federal Trade Commission \"clearinghouse\" that would enable people to track and delete the personal data held by companies.\nWatch the full speech:",

        "title": "Dark mode is coming to iOS 13",
        "body": "Apple is bringing dark mode to iOS 13, the new version of its mobile operating system for this year. The company made the announcement at WWDC 2019, a year after bringing the feature to macOS Mojave. Onstage, the company showed many of its popular apps working in dark mode, including Maps, Notes, Calendar, Music, and Messages. The company has also confirmed that dark mode is coming to the iPad with iPadOS.\nThe company says the mode will be available across all its native apps, and can also be used by third-party app developers. Users can set iOS 13\u2019s dark mode to turn on automatically at either a set time or at sunset.\nToday\u2019s announcement means that both major mobile operating systems will be receiving a dark mode in 2019 after Google said that it would be bringing one to Android Q later this year. Android\u2019s dark mode is already available in the beta version of Q, and Google is hard at work updating its first-party apps to take advantage of the new color scheme.\nFor the uninitiated, dark modes have become an incredibly popular feature in recent years. It\u2019s partly for functional reasons, and partly just because they look cool. Although claims that they can reduce eye strain have a shaky scientific basis, they can bring much more tangible benefits to devices with OLED screens, which tend to use less battery life with darker color schemes. On Android Q, for example, devices will automatically use dark mode when they\u2019re put into battery-saving mode.",

        "title": "Apple Reportedly Considering Moving Up to 30% of Production Out of China to Diversify Supply Chain",
        "body": "With the U.S.-China trade war seemingly showing no signs of slowing down, a new report claims that Apple is getting serious about diversifying its supply chain in an effort to reduce its reliance on Chinese manufacturing.\niPhone disassembly robot Daisy\nKey iPhone assemblers Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron, major MacBook maker Quanta Computer, iPad maker, Compal Electronics, and AirPods makers Inventec, Luxshare-ICT and Goertek all have been asked to evaluate options outside of China, multiple sources say. Many other Apple suppliers such as print circuit board and casing providers are closely monitoring where these major assemblers would shift their production.\nSpecifically, Apple has asked several of its major suppliers to evaluate the cost implications of shifting 15 to 30 percent of their production capacity from China to Southeast Asia countries as it prepares for a \"fundamental restructuring of its supply chain,\" according to the Nikkei Asian Review\nThe countries being considered for diversification include Mexico, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia, with India and Vietnam among the favorites for \u200ciPhone\u200c assembly, according to the report. Apple supplier Wistron already assembles a limited quantity of iPhones in India.\nAs part of the efforts, Apple reportedly has a so-called \"capital expense studies team\" tasked with negotiating with suppliers and governments.\nWhile these plans are said to have been triggered by the trade war, the report claims that Apple has decided the risks of relying so heavily on manufacturing in China are \"too great and even rising\" even if the trade war is eventually resolved.\n\"A lower birthrate, higher labor costs and the risk of overly centralizing its production in one country. These adverse factors are not going anywhere,\" said one executive with knowledge of the situation. \"With or without the final round of the $300 billion tariff, Apple is following the big trend [to diversify production],\" giving itself more flexibility, the person added.\nApple currently relies on Chinese and Taiwanese companies for the vast majority of its manufacturing needs, so diversifying its supply chain would obviously take time. The report cites a source who believes it would take at least 18 months for production to begin in new locations.",

        "title": "Apple is now the privacy-as-a-service company \u2013 TechCrunch",
        "body": "Apple shared plenty of news today at its WWDC 2019 annual developer conference, but a few of the announcements early on are potentially its biggest in terms of what they signal about the company and its direction. Specifically, Apple unveiled a new single-sign on unified ID platform, as well as a new way it\u2019ll operate as a go-between for security cameras that work with its HomeKit smart home services.\nThese didn\u2019t come out of nowhere: Apple has been playing up its privacy game for at least a few years now, and in the Tim Cook era it\u2019s especially come to the fore. But today\u2019s announcements really crystallize how Apple\u2019s approach to privacy will mesh with its transformation into becoming even more of a services company. It\u2019s becoming a services company with a key differentiator \u2013 privacy \u2013 and it\u2019s also extending that paradigm to third-parties, acting as an ecosystem layer that mediates between users, and anyone who would seek to monetize their info in aggregate.\nApple\u2019s truly transforming into a privacy-as-a-service company, which shows in the way that it\u2019s implementing both the new single sign-on account service, as well as its camera and location services updates in iOS 13. The SSO play is especially clever, because it includes a mechanism that will allow developers to still have the relevant info they need to maintain a direct relationship with their users \u2013 provided users willingly sign-up to have that relationship, but opting in to either or both name and email sharing.\nThe radial decision-making that also includes an option to create a tokenized single-use email for a direct, but unique relationship is especially inspired. It means a developer or service provider can still easily talk to you directly, but also means that they can\u2019t then trade that on for profit by selling or sharing your information with other developers and providers. It\u2019s entirely about moving the locus of control for privacy to the user, rather than playing the classic charade of providing \u201ccontrol\u201d to users in the form of long, obscure and hard to reject terms of services with onerous requirements for the user re: their data sharing by the service provider.\nApple\u2019s work with camera providers is also unique \u2013 providing actual on-device analysis of footage captured by third-party partners to deliver things that security device makers have typically offered as a value-add service themselves. That includes apparent identification of visitors to your home, for instance, and sending alerts when it detects people, as well as being able to differentiate that from other kinds of motion.\nThat\u2019s going above and beyond simply protecting your data: It\u2019s replacing a potential privacy-risk feature with a privacy-minded one, at a service level across an entire category of devices.\nThe new location services feature similarly puts all the control with users, instead of with service providers. Making it possible to provide single-use location permissions to apps is terrific for privacy-minded users, as are updates about usage, which sound like they could be detailed about what specific apps are doing with that data in Apple\u2019s estimation.\nOther new features, including HomeKit firewalling of specific services and devices, are similar in tone, and likely indicate what Apple intends to do more of in the future. Combined with its existing efforts, this begins to paint a picture of where Apple plans to play in offering a comprehensive consumer services product that is substantially differentiated from similar offerings by Google and others.\nIt\u2019s a bold play, and one that could end with Apple accruing a huge amount of control over consumer relationships with not only hardware, but also anything else that software providers want to do on their platform. Given Apple\u2019s track record with privacy to date, that\u2019s reassuring, but we should definitely watch closely to see how their business evolves if they succeed in shifting that locus of control.",

        "title": "With iPadOS, Apple\u2019s dream of replacing laptops finally looks like a reality",
        "body": "As recently as last week we could still look at the iPad and smirk at Apple\u2019s dogged insistence that its tablet works as a laptop replacement\u2014one that will even leave us asking questions like, \u201cWhat\u2019s a computer?\u201d The power was certainly there\u2014especially in latter-day models\u2014but not the freedom.\nI know this all too well. For over a year I used an iPad as my main work device, but I crawled back to the Mac after enduring months of unusable thumb drives at press junkets and frustrations springing from actions as simple as selecting text. This week, though, Apple dashed away most of my concerns with a masterstroke that it\u2019s calling iPadOS.\nCurrently, the Mac Pro is stealing much of iPadOS\u2019 thunder, but months from now I believe we\u2019ll find that Apple\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d operating system left the bigger impact. Granted, I haven\u2019t had a chance to handle iPadOS just yet, but everything I\u2019ve seen so far suggests it\u2019ll transform the iPad into the laptop replacement Apple\u2019s always wanted it to be, even while retaining\u2014no, improving\u2014the features that set it apart from devices like Microsoft\u2019s Surface tablet.\nI\u2019m willing to entertain the idea that these changes make it a better buy than a MacBook for some professionals. Oh, you can find some people who claim they already feel that way\u2014that it\u2019s just suited to a different type of workflow\u2014but their defenses tend to sag under the weight of excuses. With the changes, though, even I\u2019m looking forward to leaving my heavy MacBook Pro behind for a change in favor of taking just my tablet, its keyboard case, and the ever-so-portable Magic Mouse.\nFree from its bonds\nWith iPadOS, there\u2019s far less of a need to make excuses. Apple eliminated many of the frustrations that have dogged the tablet\u2019s standing as a true work device for years. The biggest one wasn\u2019t even mentioned in Apple\u2019s keynote: Instead, it was found lurking under Accessibility in the Settings app by developer Steve Troughton-Smith. At last, he found, the iPad Pro now comes with mouse support with a feature Apple is calling \u201cAssistive Touch.\u201d You\u2019ll have to deal with a hideous cursor, but hey, you can use both USB and Bluetooth mice ranging from the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad to fancier peripherals such as the Logitech G502.\nThat alone is enough to make it a laptop replacement for many. Nothing slowed down my old iPad workflow quite so much as the need to hold my finger down on text to select it. The process takes a heck of a lot longer than it would with a mouse, and even Apple\u2019s Toby Paterson inadvertently demonstrated its fiddly nature when he struggled to select a word on an iPad for several seconds during Monday\u2019s keynote. At the very least, it allows us to work without our hands or arms blocking the screen.\nApple Paterson only struggled to select text for a couple of seconds, but it managed to break Apple\u2019s spell a bit.\nIt\u2019s enough to make the iPad feel more like a Mac. I\u2019ve often wondered if Apple didn\u2019t bring features such as mouse support to the iPad because it was worried about killing off the non-professional MacBook user base. If so, actions like this prove that it\u2019s no longer worried or that it feels these concerns are no longer relevant.\nTake the new home screen interface, which now looks a lot more like a traditional desktop. Apple squished all those huge spaces in between apps, for one, which means you\u2019ll be able to cram all of your essential apps on the new screen. But Apple also lets you keep widgets in view on the home screen as well, and so allows you to see what\u2019s next on your calendar without swiping over to a different screen.\nApple Those icons could be even closer together, if you ask me.\nIt also acts a lot more like a traditional laptop. You can now use USB memory sticks with an iPad, and you can import data from those drives directly into the Files app. It\u2019s the logical extension of the new iPads Pros\u2019 ability to import data directly from digital cameras through their USB-C port, although with iOS 12 you can only import photos (and then you could only import them to the Photos app). Now, though, you can use these files with all kinds of apps.\nApple even paid attention to the little details, as it improved the Files app so that it now supports a Column view with detailed information about specific files. You\u2019ll also get options for sharing files or saving them as PDFs, and you can share entire folders with both other iOS users and even PC users. We can also finally use Safari on the iPad exclusively in \u201cdesktop\u201d mode, which eliminates frustrations while trying to work with interfaces that hide key elements when working on the mobile version of a site. According to Apple, this will even work with the highly complex, multi-featured web versions of services like Google Docs.\nApple Fun fact: This will make it a lot easier to use our own CMS on an iPad.\nAs nice extra touch that shows that Apple is committed to helping its users get the most out of their devices, you\u2019ll also be able to use your iPad as a second display for your Mac and as a stand-in Wacom tablet once macOS Catalina drops.\nMaking good things better\nMost of those features have been on the Mac for years, but it\u2019d be a gross oversimplification to dismiss iPadOS as a way of porting macOS to a tablet. iPadOS greatly improves the iPad without sacrificing its identity. Even though Apple removed a lot of the iPad\u2019s frustrations by giving them Mac-like designs, it also strengthened some of its tablet\u2019s signature features.\nWe can especially see this in the changes to Split-View multitasking. As a journalist, I\u2019ve long found Split View helpful because it lets me keep my draft open in one window while I keep my reference document open in another. Unfortunately, I always had to effectively redo the Split View setup when I wanted to look at something from another doc or app.\nApple Productivity, here we come.\nNow, though, Apple lets us have multiple Split View windows, all of which are browsable through Expos\u00e9. To expand on my example, that means I could open one Split View window in which I pair a writing app like iA Writer with Safari while opening another in which I pair iA Writer with a PDF document. This particular setup also works because Apple finally lets us use documents from the same app for both windows.\nSimilar changes appear in the iPad\u2019s related Slide Over windows, which hover on the right or left sides of the screen when you don\u2019t want to force the display into Split View. With iPadOS, you can access multiple Slide Over windows through an interface that\u2019s reminiscent of the app switcher on the iPhone, and you easily swipe between them with the help of a bar along the bottom of their windows.\nApple I\u2019ll probably start using Slide Over more because of this.\nHere\u2019s a caveat: A lot of its effectiveness will depend on support from third-party developers. Plenty of apps support Split View, of course, but the widely used Google Docs infamously didn\u2019t add the feature for months after it had already appeared on virtually every other writing app on the App Store.\nApple also maintains the iPad\u2019s identity by making improvements to interactions when you\u2019re holding it like a legal pad. At the simplest, it lets you access a small sidescreen keyboard that works a lot like the one-handed keyboards on devices like the iPhone XS Max. It\u2019s a good workaround for the common long-existing problem of having too big of a keyboard to type on when your other hand is busy holding the tablet itself.\nApple You can also use iOS\u2019 new swipe-typing feature with the tiny keyboard.\nApple also announced improvements for the Apple Pencil that emphasize its utility outside the usual focus on drawing. For instance, you can trigger Markup at any time by swiping up with the Pencil from a corner of the display, which will then produce an editable screenshot. That makes it even more useful for adding annotations to photos, emails, or even webpages, especially now that Markup can capture a webpage\u2019s or document\u2019s entire content rather than just the immediately visible screen. Convenience informs many of the new changes, right down to the ability to move the color palette for the Pencil around on the Notes screen.\nThe Pencil will probably even write better, as Apple improved the latency from 20ms all the way down to 9ms. Hopefully that will make it write more like a regular pen or pencil, which should improve the likelihood that professionals will use the Pencils for taking handwritten notes rather than simple tasks like highlighting.\nApple The new latency will benefit both artists and scribes.\nFinally, for all my excitement about the hush-hush mouse support, I\u2019m happy to report that Apple also didn\u2019t neglect the touch controls. With iPadOS, you can select whole swaths of text just by swiping your finger over them, which would have been a godsend for my workflow a few years ago. Moving the cursor works much the same, and additional three-finger gestures allow you to cut and paste. Federighi made it look easy (by showing the feature through a video on stage), but Toby Paterson\u2019s struggle with word selection a few minutes later makes me wonder how well it will work in practice.\nMore than padding\nThe upshot of all this is that iPadOS will significantly change how we use our iPads in the coming years. It\u2019s now got the interface as well as the power to support people who want to use it with \u201cpro\u201d apps like the upcoming full release of Adobe Photoshop. It\u2019s a massive leap forward, and it came faster than I expected, especially considering the minimal improvements Apple was making over the last couple of iOS releases.\nIt\u2019s the biggest change to the iPad experience ever, and it\u2019ll be a winner for users who like to use the same device for working at a desk and reading through content while lazing on a couch. It\u2019s still not perfect: I suspect I\u2019ll still prefer even the typing experience of the MacBook\u2019s \u201cbutterfly\u201d keyboards over the stiff typing I endure with the iPad Pro\u2019s Smart Keyboard Folio. For that reason alone, it\u2019s far too early to see iPadOS as some kind of death knell for the MacBook.\niPadOS feels as though it\u2019s part of a wider shift at Apple\u2014one in which Apple is finally giving serious thought to the frustrations and workflows of people who use their devices on a daily basis. Both iPadOS and the Mac Pro are far more robust releases that I would have expected even a year ago. It shows us an Apple that\u2019s willing to move away from its own little oddities and embrace the demands needed to meet an increasingly competitive market. At the very least, it\u2019s a sign that Apple is making sure its \u201cpro\u201d products live up to that name.\nWe\u2019re impressed, Apple. But c\u2019mon, with all those other improvements to the iPad, you seriously couldn\u2019t have added a built-in Calculator app?",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s new sign-in button is built for a post-Cambridge Analytica world",
        "body": "In 2019, Facebook isn\u2019t just a homepage; it\u2019s a passport. As mobile apps look for an alternative to passwords, big networks like Facebook and Google have become login services, letting a single login sign you into dozens of different apps. As long as Facebook or Google will vouch for you, most apps are happy to take them at their word, using open protocols like OAuth to verify the login. In return, the big companies find out what you\u2019re logging into and when. It\u2019s a good deal for apps trying to avoid the friction of a sign-up process, and one of the many ways major tech companies have made themselves indispensable \u2014 or inescapable, depending on your perspective.\nAt its Worldwide Developers Conference this week, Apple threw a wrench into that system. Apple is introducing its own single sign-on (SSO) service, a direct competitor to the services offered by Google and Facebook. The new service is aimed at paring back data collection, with only minimal data shared with the app and a promise to quarantine any data collected within Apple itself so it can\u2019t be used for other purposes. More importantly, the service will be mandatory for any iOS apps using SSO, which makes it an instant competitor to Google and Facebook\u2019s offerings.\nTo the extent that data is leaking out through the sign-in process, this plugs the biggest leak\nThat might seem like an odd move from a hardware company, but Apple has made an explicit push toward web services in recent years, with a particular focus on privacy. The new sign-on button fits right in with iMessage\u2019s focus on encryption and Safari\u2019s push against third-party tracking, all fitting in with Apple\u2019s broader vision of itself as a cleaner and more controlled alternative to the rest of the tech world. Unlike iMessage, that system won\u2019t be restricted to iPhone users. It will be available on Android and web browsers, too, which means there\u2019s less concern about lock-in than you might think. It also means the system could reach more users than any previous effort, aiming for internet-wide scale in a way that few Apple products do. But unlike cookie-blocking or encryption, this latest move is targeted at legitimate software as much as hostile intruders. The people losing data from this change won\u2019t be hackers or third-party ad networks, but apps you\u2019ve purposefully installed on your phone and networks you\u2019ve chosen to join. It\u2019s a product of the growing scope of privacy concerns in the wake of Cambridge Analytica, and it\u2019s a sign of just how much tech infrastructure needs to be rebuilt as our expectations of privacy change.\nSo what does Apple\u2019s new system actually do? The Apple SSO system isn\u2019t exactly OAuth \u2014 the open-source protocol used by Google and Facebook \u2014 but Apple says it\u2019s OAuth-like, letting third parties verify a login as authentic while protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks. But where intermediaries would typically pass along the email address associated with an account, Apple\u2019s new system will provide an email relay as a username, generated specifically for that service. In essence, Apple is adding an extra intermediary step, making sure the app doesn\u2019t know your email and that third parties can\u2019t combine data to get a picture of your activity across multiple apps. To the extent that data is leaking out through the sign-in process, this plugs the biggest leak.\nStill, it\u2019s not clear how much data was actually leaking out that way. If you\u2019re concerned about Google and Facebook knowing what apps you use, the technical situation hasn\u2019t changed much. Apple will still know which apps you\u2019re logging into and when. (It has to in order to operate the system.) The company has promised to stovepipe the information internally, but all you\u2019ve really done is transfer your trust from Google to Apple, like switching from Gmail to iCloud.\nAll you\u2019ve really done is transfer your trust from Google to Apple\nWhat\u2019s more affected is the data flowing from the larger networks (Google, Facebook, and now Apple) to the apps themselves. In most cases, the information flowing to the app is fairly straightforward \u2014 a person\u2019s name, their email, sometimes their avatar \u2014 but with most of that data moving in the background, it can be hard to tell exactly what\u2019s changing hands. Most of the data scandals of the past few years have involved tech companies failing to protect those data flows, whether it\u2019s Cambridge Analytica or plug-ins reading through your Gmail. In theory, it\u2019s now impossible to get social graph information through Facebook\u2019s API this way, but after so many broken promises, it\u2019s hard to take the company at its word. Apple\u2019s system would bake that protection into the protocol itself, taking an openly adversarial stance toward any data shared with outside apps.\nAgain, this might seem strange: Apple is tightening the reins on developers at a developer conference, of all places. But it\u2019s one of the first privacy measures that seems to grasp the norms of how privacy works after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which put the focus on abusive apps that users had willingly installed. It\u2019s not enough to make sure users know what they\u2019re getting into when they install an app. Platforms are expected to monitor and control all the ways partners could be abusing their privileges, which will mean rearchitecting how many of those partnerships work.",

        "title": "Farewell then, iTunes, and thanks for saving the music industry from itself",
        "body": "Last Monday, at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, the company\u2019s head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, announced that it was terminating iTunes. In one way, the only surprising thing was that Apple had taken so long to reach that decision. It\u2019s been obvious for years that iTunes had become baroquely bloated, a striking anomaly for a company that prides itself on elegant and functional design. So the decision to split the software into three functional units \u2013 dealing with music, podcasts and TV apps \u2013 seemed both logical and long overdue. But for internet users d\u2019un certain \u00e2ge (including this columnist) the announcement triggered reflections on personal and tech history.\nThere\u2019s been music on the internet for a long time. The advent of the compact disc in the early 1980s meant that recorded music went from being analogue to digital. But CD music files were vast \u2013 a single CD came in at about 700MB \u2013 and for most people, the network was slow. So transferring music from one location to another was not a practical proposition. But then, in 1993, researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany came up with a way of shrinking audio files by a factor of 10 or more, so that a three-minute music track could be reduced to 3MB without much perceptible loss in quality. They called their new standard MP3 and in July 1994, released the first MP3 encoder, software that could take in CD tracks and compress them using the MP3 filter.\nThis was a pivotal moment for the music industry, but it took another five years for that penny to drop. In that time, music-loving geeks everywhere had \u201cripped\u201d all of their CDs using MP3 encoders and were storing their music on hard drives. (I remember having to buy a bigger \u2013 and ferociously expensive \u2013 hard drive to house my collection.)\nAnd then in 1999, a teenage geek named Shawn Fanning created a neat software system that enabled internet users who had MP3 tracks on their PCs not only to find others with similar assets but also to exchange these tracks with one another. Fanning called his file-sharing system Napster, released it on the internet and in the process changed the world. By the time the music industry managed to get Napster shut down in 2001, it had acquired upwards of 60 million users and virtually every track that had ever been recorded was available \u2013 free \u2013 on the internet, which had now become, as someone once put it, \u201cthe celestial jukebox in the sky\u201d.\nThe problem was that most of these tracks were copyrighted and so much of what was going on was wholesale piracy. But the music industry\u2019s vanquishing of Napster turned out to be a pyrrhic victory: the genie had escaped from the bottle. Dozens of filesharing systems had come into being and the record business found itself facing an existential threat.\nWhat it should have done was create a slick online system that would enable law-abiding citizens to pay for music tracks. But this apparently lay beyond the capacity of an industry driven by executives with analogue mindsets and incentivised only to sell physical objects called CDs.\nTheir ineptitude created the kind of vacuum that capitalism abhors. And into it strode an entrepreneur who saw in the music industry\u2019s incompetence the commercial opportunity of a lifetime. His name was Steve Jobs.\niTunes was his vehicle for exploiting the opportunity. Based on SoundJam MP, a program that Jobs had acquired in 2000 and treated to an Apple makeover, it was launched early in 2001. From the outset, it was a revelation: nicely designed, functional software that made it easy to upload, organise and play one\u2019s digitised music \u2013 even if one were a complete newbie. And then in April 2003, Apple added the iTunes store to it, which made it easy to buy and download tracks \u2013 legally.\nIt didn\u2019t stop online piracy overnight, but it did open up the promise of a celestial jukebox for anyone who believed that it\u2019s better to pay for stuff. Which, in the end, turned out to be a lot of people. So, in a way, you could say that iTunes rescued the record industry from its own incompetence. But it also gave Apple a chokehold on a colossal market.\nMusic played an outsize role in the evolution of the internet. As Larry Lessig put in Free Culture: \u201cFilesharing music was the crack cocaine of the internet\u2019s growth. It drove demand for access to the internet more powerfully than any other single application.\u201d Jobs became the first licensed dealer in that drug and iTunes provided the saddle that enabled Apple to ride the tiger.\nBut over the years, the company piled more and more functions on to the software until it came to resemble something that Microsoft would have designed in the old days. And we switched to wanting music on tap rather than in electronic containers, as David Bowie predicted in 2002. It should have been re-engineered years ago. But at least that penny has finally dropped. iTunes is dead; long live music.\nWhat I\u2019m reading\nStick it to the cyberman\nRobots coming for your job?

        "body": "Say \"Hey Siri\" when using an iPad, and Apple's virtual assistant will take over the entire display, obscuring whatever you were doing on the device. Say the same thing to your Mac, however, and \u200cSiri\u200c responds in a more multitasking-friendly way by appearing in a small window in the corner of the screen, allowing you to drag and drop retrieved items from it.\n\u200ciPad\u200c concept of improved \u200cSiri\u200c behavior (image via iHelp BR\nThis less disruptive, more functional implementation of \u200cSiri\u200c in macOS may well be coming to \u200ciPad\u200c, although it's unlikely to appear in the first version of iPadOS, which is due to be released this fall. The possibility was hinted at by Craig Federighi, Apple's VP of software engineering, in response to an email sent to him by Apple user Juliano Rossi.\nResponding to Rossi's request that \u200cSiri\u200c on iPadOS behaves like on the Mac, without filling the entire screen, Federighi wrote:\n\"Hi Juliano, Thanks for the note. Really glad that you enjoyed the keynote. What you describe is certainly valid feedback. Unfortunately, it's not something we can add in at the last minute, but we will certainly consider it for the future. Thanks for caring! - craig\"\nCraig replied me back! \ud83d\ude33\nThe mail was about my request for Siri on iPad to behave like on the Mac, without filling the entire screen. Well, maybe next year. pic.twitter.com/7xIgxDB7hf \u2014 Juliano Rossi (@_JulianoRossi) June 9, 2019\nAs Federighi's response suggests, adding this less intrusive \u200cSiri\u200c behavior would require some significant changes to the OS, so it's not something that could be included at this late stage in software testing. But as Portuguese tech blog iHelp BR notes, it's at least good to know that Apple is aware of the legitimate request, which would bring iPadOS even closer to the macOS experience.\nApple often considers user feedback, but sometimes takes a while to act on it. For instance, the company eventually responded to multiple user requests that it change the volume level indicator in iOS. When pressing the volume buttons on iPhone or \u200ciPad\u200c running iOS 12 or earlier, the volume indicator displays in the center of the screen, obscuring content. As of iOS 13, coming this fall, the indicator is smaller and appears at the side of the display in a less intrusive manner.\nUnveiled last week during Apple's WWDC keynote, iPadOS is designed to bring more desktop-class functionality to iPads with bigger screens. iPadOS will incorporate several features that recognize the tablet's function as a potential computer replacement, including a new Home screen, an updated Split View to enhance multitasking, and improved Apple Pencil support.",

Needless to say, the legitimate IRS does not accept iTunes gift cards as a form of currency.\nYet the scam has continued to be rampant and it seems it has finally been enough of a concern for Apple to take action.\nNow, when a customer attempts to purchase an iTunes gift card at the Apple Store, the employee will inform the shopper that iTunes gift cards cannot be used outside iTunes or the App Store, specifically as a method of paying taxes.

        "body": "Google Maps is gaining some features previously exclusive to Google\u2019s navigation app, Waze. The company confirmed it\u2019s rolling out the ability for Google Maps users to see speed limits, speed cameras and mobile speed cameras in more than 40 countries worldwide \u2014 an expansion of its earlier launch of these features, which were previously limited to select markets.\nThe change was noted earlier by ZDNet and, of course, Reddit.\nGoogle confirmed with TechCrunch the full list of supported countries now seeing the speed cameras, which currently includes: Australia, Brazil, U.S., Canada, U.K., India, Mexico, Russia, Japan, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Morocco, Namibia, Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe.\nGoogle had not been quick to integrate Waze\u2019s best features into its own Google Maps app, following its 2013 acquisition of the popular navigation app. Instead, it seems to prefer using Google Maps as a broader platform for helping people find places including \u2014 most importantly \u2014 nearby businesses and Google advertisers.\nAbove: Image credit \u2013 Android Police\nBut last year, some people began to spot incident reports as well as crash and speed trap reports appearing in Google Maps. Those features were not broadly rolled out to all users at that time, however.\nNow, that\u2019s starting to change.\nGoogle began to roll out the ability for users in more countries to see speed cameras around two weeks ago, we understand. The rollout is taking place on both Android and iOS. But Android users will additionally be able to report mobile speed cameras and stationary cameras, while both iOS and Android users will be able to see those updates during their drive.\nThe speed limit appears in the bottom corner of the app, while speed traps show up as icons on the roads themselves.\nThe features will likely appeal to users who want similar functionality as to what\u2019s available today in Waze, but don\u2019t either care for the Waze user interface (which can be overwhelming if you\u2019re not used to it), or the way Waze chooses its routes.\nThere has been some confusion over where and when these alerts would be available, as Google failed to officially announce the features\u2019 expansion. Adding to the confusion was the fact that people were seeing the changes appear at different stages of the rollout in different countries around the world.\nDespite the usefulness of speed-related alerts, Waze remains the more useful navigation platform due to its ability to crowdsource reports of all kinds \u2014 including police ahead, crashes, cars pulled over on the side of the road, gas prices, road closures, obstacles in your path like debris, red light cameras and more.\nWe understand Google Maps uses a combination of authoritative feeds along with feedback from Google Maps users in order to locate the speed cameras.",

        "body": "13 years of iPhone: Why Apple's first smartphone was far from a guaranteed success\nDetail from the Apple website promoting the original iPhone in 2007\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nApple may never have been under as much pressure as it was in the months between unveiling the iPhone and shipping it to customers on June 29, 2007, exactly 13 years ago today.\n\"This is a day I've been looking forward to for two and a half years,\" said Steve Jobs at the unveiling of the iPhone on January 9, 2007. We had to then spend almost a full six more months waiting to get our hands on one, but finally the iPhone shipped on June 29, 2007 and for once, Apple's claims were meekly understated compared to what actually happened.\nThat first iPhone was the embodiment of why people like Apple \u2014 and why others do not. If you like computing and if you like devices, you could look at the technical specifications for this phone and call it a failure. Plenty of people did.\nEven compared to other phones of its day, the iPhone was technically anemic. It lacked the physical keyboard every other phone had, and while that criticism now seems quaintly prehistoric, others are still with us to this day. The iPhone cost too much and it was slow. Even today, you get criticized if you're not somehow both fast and cheap.\nDevelopment at a cost\nExcept most people do not focus on lists of specifications, they look at what the device can do for them. And in that respect, there simply was no comparison with the other phones of its day.\nApple knew that, Apple was banking on it, and Apple reportedly spent $150 million putting their money where its mouth was. Yet nobody could be certain the iPhone would sell and nobody could imagine how enormous it would become.\nSo in the build up to that January unveiling, the iPhone was an enormous gamble.\n\"None of this could really have happened without Steve Jobs,\" author Fred Vogelstein told CNN. \"In order to build the iPhone, you essentially had to bet the company. He essentially had to shut down all product development on everything else and suck all his most talented engineers into this one project.\"\n\"So if the iPhone had failed,\" he continued, \"there were no other products in the pipeline that Apple could've fallen back on.\"\nAll of this contributed to just how tense the iPhone team was as Jobs unveiled their creation. What made that moment worse was that his keynote presentation was the first time that the iPhone demo had worked all the way through.\nIf you watch the launch video, any time Jobs is behind a plinth demonstrating a feature on the iPhone, you can see spare iPhones ready to be picked up if anything goes wrong with the first one.\nWhat you can't see is the row of Apple engineers passing a bottle of whisky between themselves as each risky element of the demo worked without a hitch.\nIt must have felt great to be part of the iPhone team that day. Maybe you were a bit the worse for wear from the whisky, surely you were all exhausted from the two or more years of development, but the reaction in that room was everything Apple could've hoped for.\nThe reaction outside was not. Everyone was talking about the iPhone, and they were talking so much that it was like a gift of millions of dollars of free advertising. And plenty of people were excited, but we wouldn't hear from them until June 29 when they could demonstrate their excitement by buying the device.\nIn the months leading up to that, those people who we did hear from, who had a platform from which to speak, they were not excited. They may have been fearful, and they certainly saw some valid flaws, but they were certain Apple had blown it.\nWaiting time\nThe iPhone was announced in January chiefly because regulations meant its existence was going to be known soon anyway. Apple was making a telecommunications device and that has to go through approvals process. Apple just got ahead of the process being announced.\nIn the five months and 20 days between then and the iPhone actually shipping, Apple had to make the phone work. They got away with what they called a 'golden path' demo, where it worked so long as you did precisely the specified things in the right order. You couldn't ship that to customers.\nSteve Jobs with the original iPhone\nAnd as they worked, the world waited \u2014 and the world did not wait patiently. Throughout the half year between unveiling and release, the iPhone faced increasing criticism.\nFamously, Microsoft's then CEO Steve Ballmer mocked it.\n\"There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share,\" he told USA Today. \"No chance. Would I trade 96% of the market for 4% of the market? I want to have products that appeal to everybody.\"\n\"It's a $500 subsidized item,\" he continued. \"They may make a lot of money. But if you actually take a look at the 1.3 billion phones that get sold, I'd prefer to have our software in 60% or 70% or 80% of them, than I would to have 2% or 3%, which is what Apple might get.\"\nThat was not an instant reaction, though. It was not a competitor's knee-jerk response, because Ballmer said it in April 2007, nearly four months after the unveiling.\nIn hindsight Ballmer was wrong, and even he has said so since, but it wasn't a casual first-thought analysis, it was after consideration.\nNot everyone considered the iPhone in this wait, not for very long anyway. Mike Lazaridis, then co-CEO of Blackberry, was impressed by the phone.\n\"These guys are really, really good,\" he is reported to have said about Apple's iPhone.\n\"It's okay,\" his co-CEO Jim Balsillie apparently replied, \"we'll be fine.\"\nSo the heads of technology firms thought Apple had blown it. Much or maybe even most of the media did too.\nSteve Jobs jokes about an rotary-dial iPhone, not mentioning that Apple actually considered something like it\nAdAge predicted \"Why the iPhone Will Fail\" in a June 18, 2007 article. Just days before the phone shipped, the magazine concluded that it would be \"a major disappointment.\"\nTechCrunch went further and said the iPhone \"will bomb.\"\n\"That virtual keyboard will be about as useful for tapping out emails and text messages as a rotary phone,\" it said. \"Don't be surprised if a sizable contingent of iPhone buyers express some remorse at ditching their BlackBerry when they spend an extra hour each day pumping out emails on the road.\"\nEven closer to launch day, Walt Mossberg, then of All Things D, identified genuine issues such as the lack of copy-and-paste, but also predicted success.\n\"The iPhone is simply beautiful,\" he wrote. \"Expectations for the iPhone have been so high that it can't possibly meet them all. It isn't for the average person who just wants a cheap, small phone for calling and texting. But, despite its network limitations, the iPhone is a whole new experience and a pleasure to use.\"\nAfter the launch, David Pogue of The New York Times, criticized its sealed battery and how it was on a slow network.\n\"As it turns out, much of the hype and some of the criticisms are justified,\" he wrote in the New York Times. \"The iPhone is revolutionary; it's flawed. It's substance; it's style. It does things no phone has ever done before; it lacks features found even on the most basic phones.\"\nYet still, he also produced a musical tribute to it.\nWe'd waited half the year for the iPhone and then it was available. During the remaining half of the year, Apple sold 1.39 million iPhones (according to Statista). In comparison, the iPhone would peak at 231.22 million sold in 2015.\nWe expected a successful product, we expected millions of people to use them,\" iPhone senior manager Andy Grignon told CNN on the phone's tenth anniversary in 2017.\n\"Honestly, I don't know that I expected a billion people to use it,\" he continued. \"It's how you find jobs, it's how you communicate, it's how you do all these things, we had no idea that this was the product we were trying to create.\"",

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\nThe move to give Apple prime placement is significant because users often select the default or top option on apps. And Apple will require apps to offer its button if they want to offer options to login with Facebook or Google.\nApple unveiled its login button on Monday, emphasizing users\u2019 privacy and also introducing a feature that randomly generates an email address to avoid revealing the person\u2019s true email.\nMany consumers choose to sign in to independent apps using their accounts from Google or Facebook because it saves the trouble of having to create and remember separate user names and passwords for dozens of different apps.\nBut the login buttons can send some data back to their makers about the user\u2019s app habits. Apple\u2019s software chief Craig Federighi said during a keynote address on Monday that Apple was seeking to give users a more private option and developers a way to offer a fast one-step login without sending their user\u2019s data to another company.\nIn a press release about updates to its App Store review guidelines, Apple said its login button \u201cwill be required as an option for users in apps that support third-party sign-in when it is commercially available later this year.\u201d\nApple\u2019s guidelines do not appear to impose requirements on apps that have their own dedicated login system and do not use third-party buttons from Google or Facebook, such as apps from game maker Nintendo Co Ltd. Apple\u2019s button also works on websites. Its use will not be required because Apple does not hold review power over websites the way it does apps on its own store, but Apple\u2019s guidelines still ask it to be given top placement if it is used.\nApple declined to comment further beyond its executives\u2019 public remarks on Sign in with Apple. Facebook and Google declined to comment on the move, though Google said it does not require use of Google\u2019s login button for apps in its Play Store on Android devices.\nApple\u2019s suggestion to developers to place its login button above rival buttons is part of its \u201cHuman Interface Guidelines,\u201d which are not formal requirements to pass App Store review. But many developers believe that following them is the surest way to gain approval.\nApple\u2019s guidelines to developers around login tools come as developers and rivals have alleged that some of its App Store practices, such as taking a commission of up to 30% of sales made through the store, are anticompetitive.\nUnited States antitrust regulators are also laying the ground for a potential antitrust review of Apple and other major technology companies, Reuters reported Monday. In an interview with CBS News that aired on Tuesday, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said it was \u201cfair\u201d for regulators to scrutinize Apple given its size but said the company is not a monopoly in any of the markets it operates in.",

That is being realized today at WWDC 2019 with the official debut of an all-new redesigned Apple Mac Pro.\nAlthough it\u2019s a new design, the 2019 Mac Pro is also a throwback to Apple\u2019s classic \u201ccheese grater\u201d look. The interior is structured for modularity and flexibility, addressing one of the big pain points of the outgoing Mac Pro design.\nThe new Intel Xeon processor inside the Mac Pro will have up to 28 cores, with up to 300W of power and heavy-duty cooling, \u201cso it can run unconstrained at full power at all times.\u201d System memory can be maxed out at an eyebrow-raising 1.5TB, says Apple, with six-channel memory across 12 DIMM slots. There are also eight PCI Express slots, with four of them being double-wide to accommodate larger expansion cards. Two USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 and two USB-A ports will be on the rear of the system, and two more USB-C / TB3 ports will be accessible at the top. That\u2019s at least one more USB-C port than you\u2019ll find on a majority of desktop PC systems and cases today.\nWith this Mac Pro, Apple is launching a custom expansion module it calls an MPX Module, which takes advantage of a dedicated Thunderbolt 3 backbone that Apple built into the motherboard to deliver additional power and high-speed connectivity to components. The MPX Module is a giant quad-wide PCIe card that fits two graphics cards, has its own dedicated heat sink, and also has a custom Thunderbolt connector to hook into that backbone. Apple says you can spec that out with AMD\u2019s Radeon Pro Vega 2 or Radeon Pro Vega 2 Duo \u2014 and you can configure the system with two of the latter, giving you four GPUs and 128GB of HBM2 graphics memory in total.\nApple will also sell an optional \u201cAfterburner\u201d dedicated video editing card that uses an FPGA to process up to 6 billion pixels per second.\nThe power supply of the new Mac Pro maxes out at 1.4kW. Three large fans sit at the front, just behind the new aluminum grille, blowing air across the system at a rate of 300 cubic feet per minute. Apple throws in a blower as well, though it claims the machine remains quiet. And you can spec the Mac Pro out with optional wheels, if you want to have your workstation transportable.\nThe new Mac Pro is launching this fall with a starting price of $5,999. That\u2019s with a spec vastly below its maxed out exciting new features: you get 32GB of memory, an octa-core Intel Xeon CPU, Radeon Pro 580X graphics, and a 256GB SSD. Alongside the new Mac Pro, Apple today also introduced a matching 6K monitor, the 32-inch Pro Display XDR, whose starting price is a similarly lofty $4,999.",

        "body": "A new feature in an upcoming version of Apple 's iOS will enable iPhones to look at images and identify which parts of that picture are cats or dogs.\nThe software, called VNAnimalDetector, basically draws a digital rectangle around any part of a photograph containing an animal and labels it as either a cat or dog.\nThe software shows Apple's continued efforts to take complicated and tricky machine learning techniques, and package them as part of the iPhone operating system.\nIt also emphasizes Apple's large investment into computer vision, a subset of computer science that focuses on enabling cameras and other sensors to \"see\" and understand the real world. Computer vision is also a core underlying technology for self-driving cars and augmented reality glasses.\nThe detector also suggests that Apple is very aware of how many pictures of their fuzzy friends iPhone users take. Apple's Photos app has been able to identify cats and dogs from user photos since 2016.\nThe software is part of Apple's Vision framework, which gives developers tools for image recognition, and it isn't intended for end users. Instead, the Vision framework is designed to be built into apps. Apple also built a detector for humans, which can take an image as input, and draw rectangles around any people in the picture.\nIt was previously possible to identify cats or people using machine learning. Lots of computer scientists and big companies have made pet detectors in the past. But VNAnimalDetector makes it easier to build into apps, in as little as four lines of code, according to a presentation at Apple's annual developer's conference earlier this month.\nOther new advancements in the Vision framework include the ability to identify whether two images are similar, additional facial recognition abilities and the ability to identify which objects are in a photo, even if they're not pets.\nAdditional technical information about the Vision API is available on Apple's website. Additional cat photos can be found all over the internet.",

        "title": "Google\u2019s login chief would rather you use Apple\u2019s sign-in button than keep using passwords",
        "body": "Apple shook up the world of logins last week, offering a new single sign-on (or SSO) tool aimed at collecting and sharing as little data as possible. It was a deliberate shot at Facebook and Google, which currently operate the two major SSO services. But while Google wasn\u2019t happy about the veiled privacy jabs, the company\u2019s login chief is surprisingly sunny about having a new button to compete with. While the login buttons are relatively simple, they\u2019re much more resistant to common attacks like phishing, making them much stronger than the average password \u2014 provided you trust the network offering them.\nAs Google expands its own Android two-factor system, I talked with product management director Mark Risher about why Apple\u2019s new sign-in button might not be as scary as it seems.\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\nIt\u2019s hard to put a finger on the benefit of all of these different login tools, but it does feel like things are getting better? In my personal experience, I\u2019m not being asked for a password nearly as often as I was five years ago.\nRight, and it\u2019s way, way better. Usually with passwords they recommend the capital letters and symbols and all of that, which the majority of the planet believes is the best thing that they should do to improve their security. But it actually has no bearing on phishing, no bearing on password breaches, no bearing on password reuse. We think that it\u2019s much more important to reduce the total number of passwords out there. Once you start federating accounts, it means that maybe you still have a few passwords, but some new service you\u2019re just trying out doesn\u2019t need a 750-person engineering team dedicated to security. It doesn\u2019t need to build its own password database, and then deal with all the liability and all the risk that comes with that.\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s much more important to reduce the total number of passwords\u201d\nYou also handle Google\u2019s SSO tool, which got some competition from Apple last week at WWDC. Part of the pitch seemed to be that Apple\u2019s SSO system will collect less data and respect privacy more. Do you feel like that\u2019s a fair criticism?\nI will take the blame that we have not really articulated what happens when you press that \u201csign in with Google\u201d button. A lot of people don\u2019t understand, and some competitors have dragged it in the wrong direction. Maybe you click that button that it notifies all your friends that you\u2019ve just signed into some embarrassing site. So getting someone out there to reinvigorate the space and to make it clear what this means and what happens, that is really beneficial.\nBut there was a bunch of innuendo wrapped around the release that suggested that only one of them is pure, and the rest of them are kind of corrupt, and obviously I don\u2019t like that. We only log the moment of authentication. It\u2019s not used for any sort of re-targeting. It\u2019s not used for any sort of advertising. It\u2019s not distributed anywhere. And it\u2019s partly there for user control so that they can go back and see what\u2019s happened. We have a page, part of our security checkup, that says, \u201chere\u2019s all the connected apps, and you can go and break that connection.\u201d This current product, I haven\u2019t seen how it will be built, but it sounds like they will log that moment as well and then also, every email that\u2019s ever sent by that company, which sounds a lot more invasive. But we\u2019ll see how the details work out.\nI honestly do think this technology will be better for the internet and will make people much, much safer. Even if they\u2019re clicking our competitors button when they\u2019re logging into sites, that\u2019s still way better than typing in a bespoke username and password, or more commonly, a recycled username and password.\nThe basic premise of this kind of login is that you can log in once to Google (or Apple or Facebook) and then extend that login to everything else. But does that model still make sense? Why not have different levels of security for different services instead of putting all our eggs in one basket?\n\u201cWe\u2019re being much more opinionated because our users are asking us to be much more opinionated\u201d\nPart of your premise is I have high-security and low-security services. But the problem is that things don\u2019t stay in that low-security bucket. We evolve over time. When I first signed up for Facebook in 2006, I didn\u2019t have anything useful there. Nowadays, it\u2019s much more important. And how many people go back and upgrade? It\u2019s quite rare. The other problem is we see lots and lots of these lateral attacks, where someone doesn\u2019t go directly after your bank, they go after your friend or your assistant and they use that account to send a message that\u2019s convincingly from them, asking for a wire transfer or asking for the answer to your secret question, which they can then go and play back into the site. So the more of these accounts that you leave loosely protected, the more exposed you are to that.\nPeople often push back against the federated model, saying we\u2019re putting all our eggs into one basket. It sort of rolls off the tongue, but I think it\u2019s the wrong metaphor. A better metaphor might be a bank. There are two ways to store your hundred dollars: you could spread it around the house, putting one dollar in each drawer, and some under your mattress and all of that. Or you could put it in a bank, which is one basket, but it\u2019s a basket that is protected by 12-inch thick steel doors. That seems like the better option!\nYou also ran into some security concerns around the Titan Security Key last year. Some security experts were worried that any key made in China was potentially vulnerable. How much do you worry about supply chain interference?\n\u201csome of the innuendo from Apple was a little annoying\u201d\nIt\u2019s definitely part of the threat model. It\u2019s something that we engineered for, all the way down to the protocol. I do think some of the response to the Titan key was unnecessarily alarmist, for a few reasons. One is that, those concerns had always been part of our mindset. So we said, we won\u2019t trust people, regardless of what country they\u2019re in. That\u2019s why the chip is sealed. The chip has an attestation that\u2019s available for it. The chip is not field-upgradeable. In fact, that\u2019s why we just did all these replacements, because by design, we can\u2019t push code out there to change it. There were many reasons why I didn\u2019t think that was the real threat people should be concerned about.\nOver the past few years, there\u2019s been a major shift in the way people think about tech privacy \u2014 not trusting companies less, but also being aware of all the different ways things can go bad once all this data is in the open, getting shared and combined in different ways. How have you responded to that?\nWe\u2019ve really gone through a paradigm shift. We used to say, it\u2019s your data, we\u2019ll just let you make a decision and then that\u2019s on you. Now we\u2019re being much more opinionated because our users are asking us to be much more opinionated. You can see that manifest in the security checkup, which now actually gives you a personalized set of recommendations based on your own patterns. It used to say you have 16 different devices, like see if anything was suspicious. And users said \u201cNo, why don\u2019t you tell me what looks suspicious?\u201d So now we say, \u201cYou have 16 devices. These four we haven\u2019t seen in 90 days. Are you sure you didn\u2019t give it to a friend and forget to sign out or, you know, sell it on eBay?\u201d There\u2019s this delicate balance: how do you nag someone just the right amount, but also give them that sort of editorial level of protection that they\u2019re expecting?\nThere is this concern with the Apple sign-in that even if it\u2019s a positive product, they\u2019re being too heavy-handed in forcing it on developers. You could say the same thing about a lot of the Google projects you\u2019re talking about. Do you worry about nudging users too hard?\nI worry about it. That\u2019s the problem with cynicism. Cynicism is when people don\u2019t trust your motives. You say, \u201cHere\u2019s a product that will keep you more safe,\u201d and people say, \u201cHey, what are you going to do with it?\u201d I think it\u2019s an ecosystem problem. We have a competitor who was collecting phone numbers as a security challenge, but then allegedly also using them to build up a graph for advertising re-targeting. That\u2019s bad for the whole ecosystem because it makes people not trust us.",

        "title": "The Clever Cryptography Behind Apple's 'Find My' Feature",
        "body": "When Apple executive Craig Federighi described a new location-tracking feature for Apple devices at the company's Worldwide Developer Conference keynote on Monday, it sounded\u2014to the sufficiently paranoid, at least\u2014like both a physical security innovation and a potential privacy disaster. But while security experts immediately wondered whether Find My would also offer a new opportunity to track unwitting users, Apple says it built the feature on a unique encryption system carefully designed to prevent exactly that sort of tracking\u2014even by Apple itself.\nIn upcoming versions of iOS and macOS, the new Find My feature will broadcast Bluetooth signals from Apple devices even when they're offline, allowing nearby Apple devices to relay their location to the cloud. That should help you locate your stolen laptop even when it's sleeping in a thief's bag. And it turns out that Apple's elaborate encryption scheme is also designed not only to prevent interlopers from identifying or tracking an iDevice from its Bluetooth signal, but also to keep Apple itself from learning device locations, even as it allows you to pinpoint yours.\n\"Now what\u2019s amazing is that this whole interaction is end-to-end encrypted and anonymous,\" Federighi said at the WWDC keynote. \"It uses just tiny bits of data that piggyback on existing network traffic so there\u2019s no need to worry about your battery life, your data usage, or your privacy.\"\n\"I have not seen anyone actually deploy anything like this to a billion people.\" Matthew Green, Johns Hopkins University\nIn a background phone call with WIRED following its keynote, Apple broke down that privacy element, explaining how its \"encrypted and anonymous\" system avoids leaking your location data willy nilly, even as your devices broadcast a Bluetooth signal explicitly designed to let you track your device. The solution to that paradox, it turns out, is a trick that requires you to own at least two Apple devices. Each one emits a constantly changing key that nearby Apple devices use to encrypt and upload your geolocation data, such that only the other Apple device you own possesses the key to decrypt those locations.\nThat system would obviate the threat of marketers or other snoops tracking Apple device Bluetooth signals, allowing them to build their own histories of every user's location. \"If Apple did things right, and there are a lot of ifs here, it sounds like this could be done in a private way,\" says Matthew Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University. \"Even if I tracked you walking around, I wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize you were the same person from one hour to the next.\"\nIn fact, Find My's cryptography goes one step further than that, denying even Apple itself the ability to learn a user's locations based on their Bluetooth beacons. That would represent a privacy improvement over Apple's older tools like Find My iPhone and Find Friends, which don't offer such safeguards against Apple learning your location.\nHere's how the new system works, as Apple describes it, step by step:",

        "body": "Apple plans to release a 16-inch MacBook Pro in September, according to Jeff Lin, an analyst at research firm IHS Markit.\nMacRumors concept of 16-inch MacBook Pro display\nLin believes the 16-inch display will be an LCD supplied by LG Display, with a resolution of 3,072\u00d71,920 pixels, as outlined in IHS's latest Emerging PC Market Tracker report, published Thursday and obtained by Forbes\nIHS Markit via Forbes\n\"We foresee that Apple will release a new product [at the] Sep'19 Apple event if there\u2019s no unexpected development issue,\" Jeff Lin, Associate Director, Consumer Electronics at IHS Markit, said in an email, referring to the 16-inch MacBook Pro.\nFor comparison, the 15-inch MacBook Pro has a resolution of 2,880\u00d71,800 pixels.\nKorean website The Elec recently reported that Samsung was in talks with Apple about supplying OLED displays for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but if the IHS Markit report is accurate, the notebook will have a LCD instead.\n16-inch MacBook Pro rumors began with well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Back in February, he said the notebook would launch at some point in 2019 with an \"all-new design,\" but he did not comment on which display technology the notebook would use or share any other details.\nAs would be expected, Lin claims the 16-inch MacBook Pro will feature a newer processor. No other details are known.\nIHS Markit has an entire team dedicated to display-related research, with close ties to the supply chain, so this rumor carries some weight. The research firm accurately revealed the original 10.5-inch iPad Pro's resolution nearly four months in advance and also saw LTPO coming to the Apple Watch.\nApple has never unveiled new Macs at its annual iPhone event in September, often waiting for October instead. Either way, it sounds increasingly likely that a 16-inch MacBook Pro is coming at some point this year.",

Their results reveal incredible levels of employee satisfaction, productivity, creativity and collaboration for Mac users across all major types of employee groups (IT, Human Resources, Sales, and Engineering).\nWhen asked how their work has improved as a result of using a Mac for work, the answers were very favorable for Apple in the enterprise:\n97% of respondents claim increased productivity\n95% claim increased creativity\n94% claim self-sufficiency with technology\n91% claim increased collaboration\nMoreover, the vast majority of people surveyed (79%) stated that they would not be able to do their jobs as well without a Mac. I personally echo those results as I would gladly purchase my own computer over having to use a Windows machine. I\u2019ve become accustomed to the flexibility of apps like Alfred, PDFpen, and Soulver. As an iPhone user, I also love the seamless integration between my mobile devices and my laptop.\nResearch confirms Mac users experience minimal issues on their computers. In fact, 70% of all respondents have experienced two or fewer issues on their Mac within the last 12 months. Of the respondents who cite issues, the leading culprit was actually a network problem \u2014 nothing to do with the device itself.\nAll of the information has been compiled into a downloadable ebook that looks at how users perceive the use of Apple products in the enterprise. While Chromebooks are certainly popular in the K\u201312 market, the Mac is really heating up in the enterprise. As technology has become more personal, employees don\u2019t watch to use cheap PCs that are under-powered and loaded with bloatware. They want to use the technology they are comfortable with, and therefore that is increasingly becoming the Mac.\nYou can download the ebook from Jamf by clicking here.\nDo you have a Mac at work?
