The letter, which was originally released internally to employees, now sits at the top of Apple's website.\nEarlier today, it was reported that Apple Maps has updated its map of Washington D.C. to correctly show Black Lives Matter Plaza, a portion of 16th Street which was renamed by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. The map has also been photographed again to show the street art, which simply says \"Black Lives Matter\" in huge yellow lettering. The street, and the art, run towards the White House.\nIt has also been discovered that Apple is supporting the Black Lives Matter movement with Siri. Reported by AppleInsider, if users say \"All Lives Matter\" to Siri, the voice assistant will now caution you that it and the Black Lives Matter movement are different and prompt you to visit the Black Lives Matter website.\nIf you say \"All Lives Matter\" to Siri, she will respond with the following message:\n\"'All Lives Matter' is often used in response to the phrase 'Black Lives Matter', but it does not represent the same concerns. To learn more about the Black Lives Matter human rights movement, visit BlackLivesMatter.com.\"\nWe tried the phrase and, sure enough, got the prompt. Apple has not said if this update to Siri is live for all iPhone users, but it would be safe to assume that, if it is not yet, it will be very quick.",

        "title": "After 15 Years, Apple Prepares to Break Up With Intel",
        "body": "Apple has created a large chip-design team, building on the 2008 purchase of a 150-employee start-up, PA Semi. A large number of them once worked at Intel, including Johny Srouji, who reports directly to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook.\nApple\u2019s move would be a symbolic blow to Intel, particularly when civilian and military officials are concerned over the weakening of American leadership in chip manufacturing, which they regard as crucial to the country\u2019s ability to retain an edge over China. Legislation introduced in Congress last week, with rare bipartisan agreement, would funnel tens of billions of dollars to bolstering U.S. research and manufacturing in semiconductors.\nIntel has long been a U.S. standard-bearer in the semiconductor business, particularly in the complex manufacturing processes that turn silicon wafers into the chips that power computers, smartphones, cars and consumer devices.\nThe move\u2019s financial impact on Intel would be muted, at least in the short term. Intel sells Apple about $3.4 billion in chips for Macs each year, according to C.J. Muse, an Evercore analyst. That is less than 5 percent of Intel\u2019s annual sales, and Mr. Muse forecast that the blow would be closer to half that since Apple might change the chips on only some Mac models. Apple sells nearly 20 million Macs a year.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not chicken feed, but it\u2019s compared to total PCs sold of about 260 million\u201d a year, said Tim Bajarin, an analyst who has tracked Apple for nearly 40 years. Intel supplies the chips for just about every PC.",

The Apple silicon will include the Neural Engine for machine learning applications.\nApple announced that it is working on a family of SoCs \u2014 system on a chip \u2014 to deploy across its Mac lineup, both laptops and desktops.\nWith macOS Big Sur, Apple has already updated its own applications to support the new Apple chips natively, including Final Cut Pro. Third-party developers can get started by recompiling their apps in the new version of Xcode. Apple announced that key partners including Adobe and Microsoft have already gotten many of their apps running on ARM.\nApple demoed all of macOS Big Sur\u2019s features on a Mac running ARM, a so-called Apple Development Platform.\nApple is reviving the Rosetta brand, Rosetta 2, as the new option for emulation. Emulation will be required for apps that have not been updated to run natively. Apple says Rosetta 2 can offer fast performance and is transparent to users, although obviously apps with native code is preferred. New virtualisation options will be available for developers who need to run virtual machines on their computer.\n\u201cMost apps will just work\u201d.",

        "title": "WWDC keynote format was great \u2013 I'd like this every year",
        "body": "Yesterday\u2019s WWDC keynote was a very different beast from the usual live event. Not just the lack of audience, but the fact that each of the presentations was very obviously pre-recorded.\nClearly those who like to attend in person will feel they missed out on that experience. But I have to say that I very much preferred the pre-recorded presentations, for several reasons \u2026\nFirst, and most significantly, the pace. WWDC keynotes and iPhone launches alike can sometimes feel like they drag \u2013 that they are far longer than they should be. Yesterday\u2019s pace was fast-paced, with nothing that felt like padding.\nApple being Apple, I\u2019m sure there are endless rehearsals for live keynotes \u2013 but even so, you can only really get a sense of how an entire event hangs together when you can watch the whole thing. Given the senior execs involved, my guess is that there is no more than one or two full \u2018dress rehearsals\u2019 for the entire event; rather, individual presenters rehearse their own segments multiple times.\nBut having everything pre-recorded means that Apple can sit back and take a leisurely look at the event as a whole, and get feedback from multiple people about how well it works. If some segments feel rushed while others feel slow. It can re-record at will, and edit the final footage into the best possible event.\nThe end result is something that feels far slicker, better-paced and consistently interesting.\nSecond, the lack of whooping and applause. Sure, there will be those who feel that made the event feel less exciting, but I\u2019m a Brit: I\u2019m allergic to whooping, and the constant applause just slows things down. It also felt to me like there was less playing to the audience too: less \u2018truly magical\u2019 hyperbole, and more facts.\nThird, it was more visually interesting. The different settings gave the presentations greater variety than a bunch of people standing on the same stage. Even with Tim Cook\u2019s intro in the theater, the fact that it was pre-recorded meant they could have more camera angles, giving it a better aesthetic than the limited viewpoints we get in a live presentation before an audience.\nFinally, Apple was able to get the replay online almost instantly, complete with bookmarks that let us jump straight to the specific section we want to watch or re-watch:\nSo for me, this is a format I\u2019d love to see every time, for both WWDC keynotes and iPhone launches.\nI don\u2019t for one moment imagine I\u2019ll get it, of course. Apple is too big a fan of the atmosphere and the applause and, yes, the whooping. As soon as the company is able to bring a theater-full of people together without killing them, I\u2019m sure it will do so.\nBut I hope the company will learn lessons from this. Fewer live segments, more video. It could even have Cook hosting the event on stage before a live audience, but have all of the individual presentations be videos. That would still allow for applause, but at least it would be likely limited to the end of each segment.\nWhat\u2019s your view? Would you prefer traditional live presentations, a fully pre-recorded event or some kind of hybrid, with more use of video presentations?

        "title": "TikTok to stop reading user clipboards after being exposed by iOS 14 privacy feature",
        "body": "Apple has reinforced its commitment to privacy with iOS 14, which includes new features to give users more control over what data each app has access to. One of these features is a new banner alert that lets users know if an app is pasting from the clipboard, and this is already exposing the behavior of some popular apps.\nAccording to several reports shared on the web after the release of iOS 14 beta, TikTok is one of the apps that constantly reads user clipboards. The new privacy banner keeps showing up on the screen all the time when the app is running, and this has not only annoyed beta users but also made them worried about TikTok copying personal data without permission.\nTikTok told Telegraph that the app is not collecting data from the clipboard. Instead, the app has a custom system to identify repetitive spam behavior. The company alleges this feature is triggering the new iOS 14 privacy banner, and for that reason, TikTok will no longer automatically access user clipboards with a future update to the app.\nFor TikTok, this was triggered by a feature designed to identify repetitive, spammy behavior. We have already submitted an updated version of the app to the App Store removing the anti-spam feature to eliminate any potential confusion. TikTok is committed to protecting users\u2019 privacy and being transparent about how our app works.\nAccording to the Telegraph report, there are other apps that constantly check the iOS clipboard, including AccuWeather, Overstock, AliExpress, Call of Duty Mobile, Patreon, and Google News. We don\u2019t know the exact reason for each app to read what users copied from other apps, but TikTok\u2019s decision proves that Apple is right to implement more privacy tools.\nHey @tiktok_us, why do you paste from my clipboard every time I type a LETTER in your comment box?

        "title": "Apple should acquire DuckDuckGo to put pressure on Google Search, analyst argues",
        "body": "One analyst has a suggestion for how Apple could put pressure on Google: acquire DuckDuckGo. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi says that an acquisition of privacy-focused DuckDuckGo would allow Apple to put pressure on Google and tap into lucrative advertising revenue.\nAccording to Sacconaghi, Apple should acquire DuckDuckGo for around $1 billion as a way to put more pressure on Google and capture the advertising revenue that comes from the search industry. As reported by Street Insider, acquiring DuckDuckGo could serve as a \u201cstalking horse\u201d to pressure Google:\nGoogle is clearly the dominant force in search today. However, we suspect the company\u2019s fear of \u2018rocking the boat\u2019 \u2014 which could compromise $15B in profits it captures today from iOS \u2014 may ultimately limit its freedom of action with Apple. Conversely, Apple may be in a stronger position than at first glance, given it controls the keys to the kingdom on who can monetize iOS search. However, it remains uncomfortably dependent on Bing to act as a counter weight to Google \u2014 hence our suggestion that Apple acquire its own search engine. Finally, Microsoft Bing may (counterintuitively) have the most \u2018option value\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis the status quo \u2014 although it remains to be seen how aggressively it will pursue this opportunity.\nCurrently, Google is believed to pay Apple upwards of nearly $10 billion to be the default search engine option on iPhone and iPad. Sacconaghi says that Google in turn generates around $15 billion in profit from being the default search engine, but he warns that Google could back out of the agreement instead of renewing.\nBut with that being said, the current arrangement between Apple and Google counts for a substantial portion of Apple\u2019s Services revenue every year. Whether or not Apple would be willing to give up that yearly $9 billion payment from Google is unclear, and it would need to have big plans for DuckDuckGo monetization, if so.\nAn acquisition of DuckDuckGo wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean Apple would even have to change its agreement with Google. Instead, Apple could use its ownership of DuckDuckGo to put pressure on Google and change the terms of the agreement.\nWhat do you think of Sacconaghi\u2019s suggestion? Do you think Apple should cut ties with Google and acquire DuckDuckGo? Let us know down in the comments!",

        "body": "The number of users of an app which lets people listen in to police radio broadcasts across the country is nearly doubling everyday during the protests, according to its developer. As of Monday morning, '5-0 Radio' had skyrocketed above apps such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to the most popular paid app, and the second most popular free app on the Apple App Store, according to Apple's own rankings. Other similar apps have also jumped in popularity.\nAdvertisement\nThe news gives some indication to the scale of the protests and the attention they are drawing. The protests started last week when a white police officer killed George Floyd, an unarmed black man. One person at the protests told Motherboard that their friends have, in some cases, been listening to the scanners and giving them information about planned police actions so they can protect themselves.\n\"This weekend was the largest spike overall in 5-0 Radio listeners in the 10+ year history of this app. And there\u2019s no indication that the spike is ending anytime soon. For the past four days, the numbers of users have almost doubled the previous day.\" Allen Wong, the app's developer, told Motherboard in an email on Sunday.\nA list of some of the most popular radio feeds on 5-0 Radio on Sunday.

Another called 'Broadcastify Pro' was in 12th place on the paid app rankings.\nAdvertisement\n\"I\u2019ve seen spikes in popularity during other protests, but this is the largest spike since the Boston Marathon bombing and the subsequent manhunt,\" Wong said. \"I saw almost half a million active users in just my app alone yesterday,\" they added on Monday.\nOver the weekend, thousands of people tuned in to the broadcasts for individual city police forces, from Chicago to Philadelphia to New York, according to a rolling list of listener counts included in the app that Motherboard reviewed Sunday. The app comes in both free and paid versions, with the latter giving a user access to more feeds and features. The version Motherboard used to listen to police radios during weekend protests in the U.S. was the free version.\n\"Make arrests,\" a NYPD police officer said on one of the feeds referring to an area of Brooklyn on Sunday.\n5-0 Radio relies on volunteers who have a radio scanner to provide the app with feeds of police chatter. The app takes all of those various feeds and puts them in an interface that a non-technical person would be able to use.\n\"All they need is a scanner and a computer to share audio with everyone on the app,\" Wong said. \"We also saw a spike in volunteers who shared audio during the peak of coronavirus cases in NYC. That was nice to see, because the 5-0 Radio community was trying to help keep communications open between different hospitals and departments and precincts who normally wouldn\u2019t have access to each other\u2019s communications.\"",

        "body": "After a strong performance yesterday that pushed Apple's stock price to another record high, shares are up over two percent again today. With today's boost, Apple's market capitalization has surpassed $1.5 trillion, making it the first U.S. company to reach that mark.\nMarket capitalization is simply the share price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares of the company's stock, yielding the company's overall stock market value. At a current price of around $352 per share and with roughly 4.3 billion shares outstanding, Apple's market capitalization is now at around $1.53 trillion.\nApple's total share count has been declining in recent years as the company has been aggressively buying back stock, which helps to increase the value of the remaining shares on the market. That decrease in share count is, however, accounted for in market capitalization calculations.\nAfter hitting an all-time high share price in late January, Apple's stock slid along with the rest of the market amid the global health crisis, with Apple's share price falling 35% from its peak by late March. A strong and steady recovery brought Apple back up to a fresh all-time high last Friday, and it has continued to gain in recent days.",

        "title": "Apple Watch fall detection helps save life of 92-year-old farmer after fall from a ladder",
        "body": "The fall detection feature on Apple Watch is being credited with alerting emergency services after a 92-year-old farmer fell from a ladder. As reported by KETV in Omaha, Nebraska, Jim Salsman fell from his ladder and \u201cwould\u2019ve been dead\u201d without the help from his Apple Watch.\nSalsman climbed a 21-foot ladder last month to \u201csecure a grain bin from pigeons\u201d (remember, this is Nebraska). He says he was stable on the ladder until a gust of wind came along and pushed the ladder by 2 feet. \u201cIt was just a dumb stupid mistake on my part,\u201d Salsman said.\nWhen he hit the ground, Salsman tried to roll toward his truck that was parked several hundred feet away. Once he realized that was not possible, he tried using Siri to reach someone for help. What he didn\u2019t realize was that the fall detection feature had already kicked in and sent an alert to the Grant Volunteer Fire Department.\nI talked into it, \u201cHey Siri Jim Salsman, hurt bad on the farm,\u201d he said. What Salsman didn\u2019t realize is that the device, equipped with a fall alert system, had already sent an alert to the Grant Volunteer Fire Department. They responded that they were on their way and found Salsman using GPS.\nOnce the fire department arrived, Salsman was taken to the hospital and treated for a broken hip and other fractures. A month later, he is recovering at a rehabilitation hospital in Nebraska, but things are made more challenging because of the COVID-19 pandemic due to restrictions on in-person visitors.\nHis son, Ron, says that his father has faced more than his fair share of adversity over the years:\nThey\u2019ve lived through droughts and blizzards, and getting cattle in the middle of the night in cold winter weather, so they just had to deal with a lot of adversity over time. And it just becomes a part of them, I think.\nUltimately, the Apple Watch fall detection feature is what Salsman thinks saved his life. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have this watch, I think that I would\u2019ve been dead before anybody missed me. I really do,\u201d Jim concluded.\nApple Watch Series 4 and later include a built-in fall detection feature. It\u2019s turned off by default if you\u2019re under 65, but anyone can turn it on from the Watch app on the iPhone.\nThe feature works by intelligently detecting when a sudden fall occurs, automatically calling emergency services if the person doesn\u2019t dismiss the alert within one minute of falling. If the person\u2019s emergency contact information is filled out, that contact will be notified with a text message and a map of the watch\u2019s location at the time of the fall.\nRecently, Apple expanded the Emergency SOS feature to add a new option that automatically shares Medical ID information with emergency services.

        "title": "TikTok and 53 other iOS apps still snoop your sensitive clipboard data",
        "body": "In March, researchers uncovered a troubling privacy grab by more than four dozen iOS apps including TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media and video-sharing phenomenon that has taken the Internet by storm. Despite TikTok vowing to curb the practice, it continues to access some of Apple users\u2019 most sensitive data, which can include passwords, cryptocurrency wallet addresses, account-reset links, and personal messages. Another 32 apps identified in March haven't stopped either.\nThe privacy invasion is the result of the apps repeatedly reading any text that happens to reside in clipboards, which computers and other devices use to store data that has been cut or copied from things like password managers and email programs. With no clear reason for doing so, researchers Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk found, the apps deliberately called an iOS programming interface that retrieves text from users\u2019 clipboards.\nUniversal snooping\nIn many cases, the covert reading isn\u2019t limited to data stored on the local device. In the event the iPhone or iPad uses the same Apple ID as other Apple devices and are within roughly 10 feet of each other, all of them share a universal clipboard, meaning contents can be copied from the app of one device and pasted into an app running on a separate device.\nThat leaves open the possibility that an app on an iPhone will read sensitive data on the clipboards of other connected devices. This could include bitcoin addresses, passwords, or email messages that are temporarily stored on the clipboard of a nearby Mac or iPad. Despite running on a separate device, the iOS apps can easily read the sensitive data stored on the other machines.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very dangerous,\u201d Mysk said in an interview on Friday, referring to the apps\u2019 indiscriminate reading of clipboard data. \u201cThese apps are reading clipboards, and there\u2019s no reason to do this. An app that doest have a text field to enter text has no reason to read clipboard text.\u201d\nThe video below demonstrates universal clipboard reading:\nBack in the news\nWhile Haj Bakry and Mysk published their research in March, the invasive apps made headlines again this week with the developer beta release of iOS 14. A novel feature Apple added provides a banner warning every time an app reads clipboard contents. As large numbers of people began testing the beta release, they quickly came to appreciate just how many apps engage in the practice and just how often they do it.\nAdvertisement\nThis YouTube video, which has racked up more than 87,000 views since it was posted on Tuesday, shows a small sample of the apps triggering the new warning.\nTikTok in the spotlight\nRecent headlines have focused particular attention on TikTok, in large part because of its massive base of active users (reported to be 800 million, with an estimated 104 million iOS installs in the first half of 2018 alone, making it the most downloaded app for that period).\nTikTok\u2019s continued snooping has gotten extra scrutiny for other reasons. When called out in March, the video-sharing provider told UK publication The Telegraph it would end the practice in the coming weeks. Mysk said that the app never stopped the monitoring. What\u2019s more, a Wednesday Twitter thread revealed that the clipboard reading occurred each time a user entered a punctuation mark or tapped the space bar while composing a comment. That means the clipboard reading can happen every second or so, a much more aggressive pace than documented in the March research, which found monitoring happened when the app was opened or reopened.\nTo reproduce:\n1. Have something on your clipboard. Eg copy some text from Notes or a website\n2. Open TikTok and start typing in any text field\n3. You learn from iOS 14 beta each time an app \u201cpastes\u201d - but in this instance I didn\u2019t request it, and none of that text appears in UI \u2014 Jeremy Burge (@jeremyburge) June 24, 2020\nIn a statement, TikTok representatives wrote:\nFollowing the beta release of iOS14 on June 22, users saw notifications while using a number of popular apps. For TikTok, this was triggered by a feature designed to identify repetitive, spammy behavior. We have already submitted an updated version of the app to the App Store removing the anti-spam feature to eliminate any potential confusion. TikTok is committed to protecting users' privacy and being transparent about how our app works. We look forward to welcoming outside experts to our Transparency Center later this year.\nOn background, a spokesperson said that TikTok for Android never implemented the anti-spam feature.\nI sent follow-up questions asking (1) if the TikTok version for Android monitored clipboards for any other reason, (2) if any clipboard text was uploaded from the device, and (3) why TikTok didn\u2019t remove the monitoring as promised in March. The spokesperson has yet to respond. This post will be updated if a reply comes later.\nNot just TikTok\nIn all, the researchers found the following iOS apps were reading users\u2019 clipboard data every time the app was opened with no clear reason for doing so:\nApp Name \u2014 BundleID\nNews\nABC News \u2014 com.abcnews.ABCNews\ncom.abcnews.ABCNews Al Jazeera English \u2014 ajenglishiphone\najenglishiphone CBC News \u2014 ca.cbc.CBCNews\nca.cbc.CBCNews CBS News \u2014 com.H443NM7F8H.CBSNews\ncom.H443NM7F8H.CBSNews CNBC \u2014 com.nbcuni.cnbc.cnbcrtipad\ncom.nbcuni.cnbc.cnbcrtipad Fox News \u2014 com.foxnews.foxnews\ncom.foxnews.foxnews News Break \u2014 com.particlenews.newsbreak\ncom.particlenews.newsbreak New York Times \u2014 com.nytimes.NYTimes\ncom.nytimes.NYTimes NPR \u2014 org.npr.nprnews\norg.npr.nprnews ntv Nachrichten \u2014 de.n-tv.n-tvmobil\nde.n-tv.n-tvmobil Reuters \u2014 com.thomsonreuters.Reuters\ncom.thomsonreuters.Reuters Russia Today \u2014 com.rt.RTNewsEnglish\ncom.rt.RTNewsEnglish Stern Nachrichten \u2014 de.grunerundjahr.sternneu\nde.grunerundjahr.sternneu The Economist \u2014 com.economist.lamarr\ncom.economist.lamarr The Huffington Post \u2014 com.huffingtonpost.HuffingtonPost\ncom.huffingtonpost.HuffingtonPost The Wall Street Journal \u2014 com.dowjones.WSJ.ipad\ncom.dowjones.WSJ.ipad Vice News \u2014 com.vice.news.VICE-News\nAdvertisement\nGames\n8 Ball Pool\u2122 \u2014 com.miniclip.8ballpoolmult\ncom.miniclip.8ballpoolmult AMAZE!!! \u2014 com.amaze.game\ncom.amaze.game Bejeweled \u2014 com.ea.ios.bejeweledskies\ncom.ea.ios.bejeweledskies Block Puzzle \u2014 Game.BlockPuzzle\nGame.BlockPuzzle Classic Bejeweled \u2014 com.popcap.ios.Bej3\ncom.popcap.ios.Bej3 Classic Bejeweled HD \u2014 com.popcap.ios.Bej3HD\ncom.popcap.ios.Bej3HD FlipTheGun \u2014 com.playgendary.flipgun\ncom.playgendary.flipgun Fruit Ninja \u2014 com.halfbrick.FruitNinjaLite\ncom.halfbrick.FruitNinjaLite Golfmasters \u2014 com.playgendary.sportmasterstwo\ncom.playgendary.sportmasterstwo Letter Soup \u2014 com.candywriter.apollo7\ncom.candywriter.apollo7 Love Nikki \u2014 com.elex.nikki\ncom.elex.nikki My Emma \u2014 com.crazylabs.myemma\ncom.crazylabs.myemma Plants vs. Zombies\u2122 Heroes \u2014 com.ea.ios.pvzheroes\ncom.ea.ios.pvzheroes Pooking \u2013 Billiards City \u2014 com.pool.club.billiards.city\ncom.pool.club.billiards.city PUBG Mobile \u2014 com.tencent.ig\ncom.tencent.ig Tomb of the Mask \u2014 com.happymagenta.fromcore\ncom.happymagenta.fromcore Tomb of the Mask: Color \u2014 com.happymagenta.totm2\ncom.happymagenta.totm2 Total Party Kill \u2014 com.adventureislands.totalpartykill\ncom.adventureislands.totalpartykill Watermarbling \u2014 com.hydro.dipping\nSocial Networking\nTikTok \u2014 com.zhiliaoapp.musically\ncom.zhiliaoapp.musically ToTalk \u2014 totalk.gofeiyu.com\ntotalk.gofeiyu.com Tok \u2014 com.SimpleDate.Tok\ncom.SimpleDate.Tok Truecaller \u2014 com.truesoftware.TrueCallerOther\ncom.truesoftware.TrueCallerOther Viber \u2014 com.viber\ncom.viber Weibo \u2014 com.sina.weibo\ncom.sina.weibo Zoosk \u2014 com.zoosk.Zoosk\nOther\n10% Happier: Meditation \u2014 com.changecollective.tenpercenthappier\ncom.changecollective.tenpercenthappier 5-0 Radio Police Scanner \u2014 com.smartestapple.50radiofree\ncom.smartestapple.50radiofree Accuweather \u2014 com.yourcompany.TestWithCustomTabs\ncom.yourcompany.TestWithCustomTabs AliExpress Shopping App \u2014 com.alibaba.iAliexpress\ncom.alibaba.iAliexpress Bed Bath & Beyond \u2014 com.digby.bedbathbeyond\ncom.digby.bedbathbeyond Dazn \u2014 com.dazn.theApp\ncom.dazn.theApp Hotels.com \u2014 com.hotels.HotelsNearMe\n\u2014 com.hotels.HotelsNearMe Hotel Tonight \u2014 com.hoteltonight.prod\n\u2014 com.hoteltonight.prod Overstock \u2014 com.overstock.app\ncom.overstock.app Pigment \u2013 Adult Coloring Book \u2014 com.pixite.pigment\ncom.pixite.pigment Recolor Coloring Book to Color \u2014 com.sumoing.ReColor\ncom.sumoing.ReColor Sky Ticket \u2014 de.sky.skyonline\nde.sky.skyonline The Weather Network \u2014 com.theweathernetwork.weathereyeiphone\nShortly after the report was published, 10% Happier: Meditation and Hotel Tonight promised to stop the behavior and quickly followed through.

The UPS iPhone app, for instance, pulls text from the clipboard, and, in the event the text matches the characteristics of a tracking number, the app prompts the user to track the corresponding package. Google Chrome also pulls text and, in the event it\u2019s a URL, will prompt the user to browse to it. The Pixelmator photo editor reads data only if it\u2019s an image. If it is, Pixelmator will prompt the user to open it for editing. In all three cases, the data reading has a clear use case and is transparent.\nTikTok and the other offending apps, by contrast, access the clipboard for no clear reason and with no indication they are doing so. For many apps, it\u2019s hard to see any legitimate performance or usability reason for the access. Mysk said that Apple plans to credit his and Haj Bakry\u2019s research as a catalyst for the new clipboard notification put into iOS 14.\nThe clipboard reading Haj Bakry and Mysk reported raises concerns that likely extend to those using Android and possibly other operating systems. Mysk said that clipboard reading in Android apps is \u201ceven worse\u201d than iOS because the OS APIs are so much more lenient. Until version 10, for instance, Android allowed apps running in the background to read the clipboard. iOS apps, by contrast, can read or query clipboards only when active (that is, running in the foreground).\nMysk said that Apple\u2019s notification feature is a good start but, ultimately, Apple and Google should do more. One possibility is to make clipboard access a standard permission, just as access to a mic or camera is now. Another possibility is to require app developers to disclose precisely what clipboard data is accessed and what the app does with it.\nFor now, users should remain aware that any data stored in the clipboard\u2014despite it being inconspicuous to the naked eye\u2014can be regularly accessed by apps that in many cases aren\u2019t even installed locally on the device. When in doubt, flush the clipboard data by copying a character, word, or other piece of innocuous data.",

        "title": "Apple sued for allowing loot boxes in App Store",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nApple on Friday was hit with a proposed class action lawsuit targeting loot boxes in games and apps, a mechanism typically characterized by in-app purchases that present buyers with randomized digital rewards.\nA complaint filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleges Apple is complicit in promoting gambling and addictive behavior by allowing developers to market apps and games with loot boxes on the App Store.\n\"Not unlike Big Tobacco's Joe Camel' advertising campaign, Apple relies on creating addictive behaviors in kids to generate huge profits for the Company,\" the complaint reads. \"Over the last four years Defendant's App Store games have brought in billions of dollars, even though the vast majority of the games are free to download.\"\nLoot boxes are broadly defined as in-app purchases that grant users rewards, boosts, costumes, skins, weapons, or other special items. Popular in games, loot boxes provide a randomized chance to gain premium items, a mechanic that some closely associate with gambling. Indeed, real money is spent to obtain these special goods, sometimes through an in-game currency system.\nApple is being targeted by the complaint because it profits from in-app purchases.\n\"A large percentage of Apple's revenues from App Store games come from the in-game purchases of what are known in the gaming industry as loot boxes' or loot crates,'\" the lawsuit alleges. \"Dozens (if not hundreds) of App Store games rely on some form of Loot Box or similar gambling mechanism to generate billions of dollars, much of it from kids.\"\nNamed plaintiff Rebecca Taylor claims her son, \"C.T.,\" spent at least $25 in iTunes gift cards and his parents' money on loot boxes for Supercell's Brawl Stars. C.T. continues to have access to the iPhone and iPad on which Brawl Stars and other \"freemium\" games are installed. The complaint does not address Apple's parental control and App Store features that restrict minors from purchasing digital content without a parent's permission.\nAlso mentioned in the complaint are Mario Kart Tour, FIFA Soccer, and Roblox, which along with Brawl Stars constitute some of the most popular games on iOS.\nApple is also dinged for not explicitly noting the inclusion of loot boxes in App Store descriptions and allowing developers to age rate their own products.\n\"Thus, there is no notice - and no requirement of any notice by Apple - to the parent or the child that a game contains Loot Boxes or other gambling mechanisms,\" the complaint reads.\nIn sum, plaintiffs conclude loot boxes constitute gambling and are therefore in violation of California law.\nComplainants seek class status, restitution and disgorgement of the revenues wrongfully retained as a result of Apple's allegedly wrongful conduct, an injunction against further violations and court fees.",

        "body": "As part of WWDC last week, Apple announced that it will be switching to its own custom-designed processors for Macs starting later this year. As part of this transition, the company is allowing developers to apply for a modified Mac mini with an A12Z chip and 16GB of RAM to develop and test their apps on a Mac with Arm-based architecture.\nAs noted on Twitter and in the MacRumors forums, some developers are now beginning to receive this Mac mini, which is officially known as the \"Developer Transition Kit.\"\nApple promises that its Macs with custom chips will have industry-leading performance per watt. Apple said it plans to ship the first Mac with its own silicon by the end of the year and complete the transition in about two years. One of the first Apple Silicon Macs will be a redesigned 24-inch iMac in late 2020 , according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nApple said that it will continue to support and release new versions of macOS for Intel-based Macs for years to come, and it also confirmed that it still has some new Intel-based Macs in development in the interim.",

        "title": "Apple will let you port Google Chrome extensions to Safari",
        "body": "Apple unveiled macOS 11 Big Sur earlier this week and talked about some of the improvements for Safari. In addition to native extensions, Apple is adding support for web extensions. It\u2019s going to make it much easier to port an existing extension from Chrome, Firefox or Edge.\nThe company shared more details about how it\u2019s going to work in a WWDC session. Safari already supports extensions, but if you\u2019re using Safari, you know that there aren\u2019t a ton of extensions out there.\nOn iOS and macOS, you can install content blockers and apps that feature a share extension. Content blockers let you provide a list of content to block when you load web pages, such as trackers and ads.\nShare extensions let you add features in the share menu in Safari. For instance, Pocket or Instapaper take advantage of share extensions to run JavaScript on a web page and return the result to the app.\nOn macOS, developers can also take advantage of app extensions. 1Password uses that to integrate its password manager with Safari.\n\u201cThese are great if you\u2019re a native app developer already familiar with Swift or Objective-C,\u201d Safari engineer Ellie Epskamp-Hunt said.\nOther browsers have taken a different approach. They leverage web technologies, such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS. That\u2019s why Apple is adding another type of extension with Safari Web Extensions.\nLike other Safari extensions, web extensions designed for Safari are packaged with native apps. It means that developers will submit extensions to the App Store. Users will download an app that comes with an extension. The app doesn\u2019t have to do anything, it can just be a place holder.\nApple is shipping an extension converter to let you port your extension quickly. When you run it, it\u2019ll tell you if everything is going to work as expected. You can then package it in an Xcode project, sign it and submit it to the App Store.\nSome extensions require a ton of permissions. They can essentially view all web pages you visit. That\u2019s why Apple lets you restrict extensions to some websites, or just the active tab. You can also choose to activate an extension for a day so that it doesn\u2019t remain active forever.\nThe user will get a warning sign the first time an extension tries to access a site and there will be a big warning banner in Safari settings before you activate an extension that can access all your browsing data.\nThis change could potentially mean that there will be a lot more extensions for Safari in the future. Many Chrome users don\u2019t want to leave Chrome because they can\u2019t find the same extensions. If developers choose to port their extensions to Safari, Apple could convince more users to switch to Safari.",

        "title": "AirDrop between future iPhones may use lasers to transmit large files quickly",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nApple's AirDrop\nApple is researching a wireless optical communication system for mobile devices, that uses auto-targeting to precisely line up how a laser lines up with a sensor for the best transfer speeds.\nMobile device users have a multitude of ways to send files and contacts between devices, with the current systems typically relying on radio-based technologies, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Optical systems are generally benefit to have a higher potential transfer speed compared to radio, but they are not typically used in modern products like the iPhone 11.\nWhile older technologies like the early infrared-based transmission systems showed promise before Wi-Fi and Bluetooth fully established themselves, there were many issues that made optical systems difficult to use. The need to keep the devices close together and their emitters and sensors lined up sometimes made it fiddly to establish a decent connection between hardware.\nThere is also the possibility for such signals to be detected by third parties, observing the unfiltered emitting of light that is usually unrestricted by direction.\nIn a patent granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday titled \"Systems and methods for adjusting movable lenses in directional free-space optical communication systems for portable electronic devices,\" Apple outlines the combination of a laser diode and a photodiode in an optical system.\nBy using a laser, Apple improves security by severely limiting the broadcast directions of the light emitter to a very narrow field, keeping communications between devices within a specific directional range.\nThe laser's output could be put through a lens, which moves to change its direction.\nTo solve the problem of lining up devices, Apple offers the possibility of using a movable lens in front of the laser, which is used to alter its trajectory to line up perfectly with the receiving sensor. This offers the benefit of maximizing the amount of light hitting the sensor, as well as reducing the chance of missing in the first place.\nFor users, this saves them from the finicky process of making sure the two are lined up. While such a lens arrangement can only offer so much range of motion and so rely on being placed vaguely in the right orientation to begin with, it doesn't fall to the user to make the positioning perfect.\nTo assist the lens system in lining up the laser perfectly, the system relies on the receiving sensor having multiple photosensitive segments, with each able to be broken down into multiple elements. While the system may want the laser to land right in the center of the sensor area, there is a distinct chance it will hit the border between multiple elements.\nThe receiving sensor could detect the landing point of the laser.\nAfter determining where the laser is hitting the sensor area, the receiving device has the capability to send back a communication to the transmitting device of the deviation, allowing the lens to be moved to correct it. Once the laser has shifted to the perfect position, a further message can be sent advising the correction motion of the lens can cease.\nThe patent lists its inventors as Omid Momtahan and Tong Chen. Both appear on the connected patent application for \"Device awareness in line-of-sight optical communication systems\" from December 2019. That filing proposes the use of a \"discovery handshake protocol\" to securely find and identify other devices via light, before switching to a high-bandwidth communications system, in a bid to cut down the current device discovery times of five to ten seconds.\nApple files numerous patent applications on a weekly basis, but while the existence of a patent may indicate areas of interest for Apple's research and development efforts, there's no guarantee it will appear in a future product or service.\nLight-based networking has been an idea that has circulated for quite some time, with the promise of high-speed connections multiple times that of current Wi-Fi networks. There have even been experiments in using light in concert with normal Wi-Fi in so-called Li-Fi systems, with data broadcast to devices via LED light bulbs illuminating a room.\nThere have also been some signs Apple has been exploring the possibility of using Li-Fi in the future. References to a \"LiFi Capability\" appeared in iOS code in 2016, suggesting it has been in development behind the scenes for quite a few years.\nWhile the patent indicates an intention for it to used with mobile devices, there are also some applications for the technology in other fields.",

Read our ethics policy\nA looted Apple Store (Source: Fox News)\nAs the number of iPhones stolen in looting increases, thieves are going to try selling them \u2014 but Apple has disabled all of them.\nThere is a reason professional thieves steal iPhones from people far less than before, and even more reason why they rarely take demo units from Apple Stores. They know that Apple Store demo iPhones will not work for the end-user.\nWhile opportunists are using the current protest marches as a chance to loot and raid Apple Stores, they are finding that they cannot do anything with the iPhones they grab off those tables.\nFor the last full decade, Apple has locked these demo units down so efficiently that the thief can only make any money by selling people iPhones sight-unseen by mail or pretending it needs charging in a face-to-face transaction, or breaking it up for parts.\nThere are many ways customers can be legitimately buying a secondhand iPhone face-to-face. If you go this route, make certain to see it, switch it on, unlock it yourself with the seller's passcode, and check the iCloud lock activation status before paying anything. This is because all iPhones in all Apple Stores, right from the start, have special software that assists in not just periodically wiping the phone while on the floor, but locks them down completely if they leave the Apple Store premises.\nIf you pick up a looted iPhone, the device is not shy about telling you that it has been stolen from an Apple Store.\n\"This device has been disabled and is being tracked,\" it says. \"Local authorities will be alerted.\"",

        "body": "Right now, there is a pain deeply etched in the soul of our nation and in the hearts of millions. To stand together, we must stand up for one another, and recognize the fear, hurt, and outrage rightly provoked by the senseless killing of George Floyd and a much longer history of racism.\nThat painful past is still present today \u2014 not only in the form of violence, but in the everyday experience of deeply rooted discrimination. We see it in our criminal justice system, in the disproportionate toll of disease on Black and Brown communities, in the inequalities in neighborhood services and the educations our children receive.\nWhile our laws have changed, the reality is that their protections are still not universally applied. We\u2019ve seen progress since the America I grew up in, but it is similarly true that communities of color continue to endure discrimination and trauma.\nI have heard from so many that you feel afraid \u2014 afraid in your communities, afraid in your daily lives, and, most cruelly of all, afraid in your own skin. We can have no society worth celebrating unless we can guarantee freedom from fear for every person who gives this country their love, labor, and life.\nAt Apple, our mission has been and always will be to create technology that empowers people to change the world for the better. We\u2019ve always drawn strength from diversity, welcomed people from every walk of life to our stores around the world, and strived to build an Apple that is inclusive of everyone.\nBut we must do more. We commit to continuing our work to bring critical resources and technology to underserved school systems. We commit to continuing to fight the forces of environmental injustice \u2014 like climate change \u2014 which disproportionately harm Black communities and other communities of color. We commit to looking inward and pushing progress forward on inclusion and diversity, so that every great idea can be heard. And we\u2019re donating to organizations including the Equal Justice Initiative, which challenge racial injustice and mass incarceration.\nTo create change, we have to reexamine our own views and actions in light of a pain that is deeply felt but too often ignored. Issues of human dignity will not abide standing on the sidelines. To the Black community \u2014 we see you. You matter and your lives matter.\nThis is a moment when many people may want nothing more than a return to normalcy, or to a status quo that is only comfortable if we avert our gaze from injustice. As difficult as it may be to admit, that desire is itself a sign of privilege. George Floyd\u2019s death is shocking and tragic proof that we must aim far higher than a \u201cnormal\u201d future, and build one that lives up to the highest ideals of equality and justice.\nIn the words of Martin Luther King Jr., \u201cEvery society has its protectors of status quo and its fraternities of the indifferent who are notorious for sleeping through revolutions. Today, our very survival depends on our ability to stay awake, to adjust to new ideas, to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of change.\u201d\nWith every breath we take, we must commit to being that change, and to creating a better, more just world for everyone.",

        "title": "Bloomberg: Apple to announce its first ARM Mac chips at WWDC, as it starts transition away from Intel",
        "body": "Apple is reportedly going to announce its transition from Intel to ARM chips for its line of Macs at WWDC, according to Bloomberg. The event kicks off on June 22nd (hosted virtually this year), and is the usual venue where Apple announces its big platform shifts. This year, we are expecting the unveiling of iOS 14, macOS 10.16, watchOS 7 and more.\nApple has had great success using custom A-series silicon for its iPhones and iPads, with its iOS devices offering market-leading performance. It is now looking to achieve a similar feat with its laptops and \u2014 later \u2014 desktop Macs. Bloomberg says Apple plans to announce the transition this month, which will give time for Mac developers to get their apps ready when the first Apple ARM Mac ships in 2021.\nBloomberg previously reported that Apple is readying a 12-core ARM chip of its own custom design. The chip would run on a 5 nanometer fabrication process and beat the performance of the current Intel lineup of MacBook Airs.\nMoving from Intel to ARM should improve performance and battery efficiency, whilst also costing Apple less money per unit. Today\u2019s Bloomberg report says that Apple\u2019s silicon teams have observed marked gains in GPU and artificial intelligence computational performance.\nThe anonymous Twitter account @L0vetodream previously suggested that Apple would revive the 12-inch MacBook within the next year or so, and it would run on an ARM chip architecture.\nWWDC is running through the week of June 22nd, about a fortnight away. Apple is yet to officially confirm a keynote date, but is assumed to be on the 22nd (Monday) as it will be the natural time for consumer-facing product announcements, with technical sessions following throughout the rest of the week. This would follow the usual WWDC schedule Apple has followed in previous years.\nIn an aside in the same Bloomberg story, the report suggests performance improvements will be a big focus of this year\u2019s major OS releases, as well as new fitness features for Apple Watch. 9to5Mac will obviously bring you full coverage of all the announcements as they happen.",

        "body": "Apple\u2019s stock closed this Tuesday with an all-time-high record, reaching $343.99 at the end of trading. As noted by CNBC, big technology companies are performing strongly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith people working from home and relying on online services or in some cases having to buy new devices, Apple and other tech companies weren\u2019t as impacted by the current global situation. Apple, in particular, saw a decline in stocks between February and March this year, mostly due to supplier constraints, but it rose again in April.\nRight now, Apple\u2019s market value is estimated at $1.491 trillion, and it could get even higher in the future. As the company is reportedly going to announce its transition from Intel to ARM chips for its line of Macs at WWDC this month, analysts are optimistic about how these changes will impact AAPL.\nThanks to their large market caps, they\u2019ve also helped buoy the stock market, which has staged a comeback despite huge unemployment numbers sparked by widespread stay-at-home orders.\nAccording to Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani (via MarketWatch), Apple has an \u201cunderappreciated\u201d ability to create its own chips in-house. Having the entire Mac lineup running with Apple-designed ARM processors can increase margins by 500 basis points in the long run.\nIt is encouraging that Apple continues to demonstrate its leading chip design capabilities as in-housing semi design remains key to product margin expansion.\nWith WWDC 2020 taking place on June 22, we\u2019ll see how investors will react if Apple does in fact announce that it\u2019s dropping Intel processors to use its own ARM chips on the Mac.",

        "body": "Apple has registered nine unreleased iPhone models in the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) database, according to listings uncovered by MySmartPrice and confirmed by MacRumors.\nThe new and unannounced iPhones use the previously unknown model identifiers A2176, A2172, A2341, A2342, A2399, A2403, A2407, A2408, and the A2411.\nRumors have suggested Apple will complete its transition to an all-OLED lineup for this year's \"iPhone 12,\" with one new 5.4-inch device, two 6.1-inch models, and one 6.7-inch handset.\nRumors suggest the 6.7-inch \u200c\u200ciPhone\u200c\u200c and one 6.1-inch model will be higher-end OLED devices with triple-lens cameras, while the 5.4 and 6.1-inch models will be lower-end iPhones with dual-lens cameras and a more affordable price tag.\nBased on the new model numbers, it's possible that the A2176 and the A2172 refer to the two more affordable models, while the other numbers could be variants of the high-end models. All of the models are listed as running iOS 13. Apple is expected to release new iPhones in the fall.\nIn addition to the new \u200c\u200ciPhone\u200c filings, Apple also registered a previously unseen Mac model with the identifier A2330 and running macOS 10.15 Catalina.\nWe've been hearing significant rumors about an imminent update to the iMac. Previously reliable leaker CoinX said in March that an \u200c\u200ciMac\u200c\u200c update was coming \"soon,\" while an April rumor claimed a new low-cost 23-inch iMac is coming in the second half of the year.\nMark Gurman said in late April that a \"substantial\" iMac update with a possible redesign would be coming later in the year, and on Monday, Sonny Dickson claimed that a redesigned iMac with \"iPad Pro design language\" will be coming at this month's WWDC.\nSimilar EEC filings have preceded the launch of new Apple products on numerous occasions, including multiple \u200ciPad\u200c, \u200ciPad Pro\u200c, \u200ciPhone\u200c, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods models. The filings are legally required for any encrypted devices sold in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nApple Watch users will be able to run Shortcuts on their device without a connected iPhone once watchOS 7 sees release this fall, greatly expanding the feature's capability beyond iOS.\nShortcuts on Apple Watch promises to deliver powerful one-tap triggers for complex actions like running Apple Music playlists, controlling HomeKit appliances, requesting Siri processes and more. Many of those capabilities will arrive on Apple's wearable for the first time with watchOS 7.\nSiri Shortcuts support for watchOS was announced on Monday, though Apple failed to detail how the feature will work. Specifically, it was unclear whether shortcuts will be available on Apple Watch as standalone native actions or remote triggers when tethered to iPhone.\nApple answered that question in a developer session on Friday, noting Watch can run shortcuts locally without a connected iPhone.\nThere are a few factors at play in shortcut handling. First, shortcut type is taken into consideration. If the action is an NSUserActivity, watchOS 7 looks for a host app which, if installed, will run. Absence of said app results in an error message. Similarly, shortcut intents are handled locally on Watch through app extensions or remotely on iPhone as a backup.\nFederico Viticci spotted the video and shared its contents in a tweet.\nA new Shortcuts app provides users with a list of shortcuts synced across iOS, iPadOS and watchOS via iCloud. The new support also brings shortcuts to watch faces as dedicated complications.",

Apple has confirmed that the all-virtual WWDC will include a keynote address, Platforms State of the Union, 100+ engineering sessions, all-new Developer Forums, 1-on-1 labs with more than 1,000 Apple engineers, and more.\nWhile Apple had already confirmed that WWDC 2020 would start on June 22, specific details were unclear given the new all-online format prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, Apple has announced the full schedule for this year\u2019s festivities.\nAs usual, everything will begin with a Special Event Keynote on Monday, June 22 at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. This event will stream \u201cdirectly from Apple Park\u201d and be available to watch via Apple\u2019s website, the Apple Developer app, the Apple TV app, and YouTube.\nFollowing the Special Event Keynote, Apple will hold its annual Platforms State of the Union address. This will take place at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. This event will be available on-demand via the Apple Developer app and Apple Developer website. Interestingly, it sounds like it will not be \u201clive\u201d but rather released all at once.\nOne of the biggest questions regarding this year\u2019s event had been how Apple would replicate the one-on-one experiences usually available for developers with Apple engineers at WWDC. This year, developers will be able to \u201crequest an appointment with the Apple engineers\u201d work one-on-one with the latest iOS, watchOS, macOS, and tvOS releases.\nOther things on the docket for this year\u2019s virtual WWDC include over 100 engineering sessions, an all-new Apple Developer Forums design, and more. At WWDC 2020 this year, Apple is expected to introduce iOS 14, watchOS 7, tvOS 14, iPadOS 14, and macOS 10.16. There are also rumors of new hardware announcements, including a redesigned iMac. Finally, Apple is also expected to reveal its plans to transition the Mac lineup to custom ARM processors.\nHere\u2019s the full schedule for WWDC 2020 according to Apple:\nSpecial Event Keynote June 22, 10 a.m. PDT Discover exciting new innovations and updates coming to all Apple platforms later this year. The keynote address will stream directly from Apple Park via apple.com, the Apple Developer app, the Apple Developer website, the Apple TV app, and YouTube, and will also be available for on-demand playback after the conclusion of the stream.

It turns out there\u2019s a platform that\u2019s already benefiting from these Safari updates, as users can now finally watch 4K HDR content on Netflix with a Mac.\nNetflix has been offering 4K content for a long time, but Mac users have never been able to watch them due to hardware limitations, since the platform relies on the HEVC codec.\nEven after Apple launched new Mac models fully compatible with HEVC, Apple hasn\u2019t updated Safari to support the new technology, which is one of the main reasons for Netflix to limit its content to 1080p resolution on macOS.\nWith macOS Big Sur, which is currently available as a beta developer, Mac users can finally watch movies and TV shows on Netflix in 4K resolution. It also works with Dolby Vision and HDR10, which delivers more brilliant and vivid colors.\nUnfortunately, according to Apple, the 4K High Dynamic Range stream requires a Mac introduced in 2018 or later. That means older Macs can only play 1080p videos on Netflix, even with macOS Big Sur installed.\nApple has also enabled the VP9 codec for apps on iOS 14 and tvOS 14, which allows users to watch 4K HDR videos on YouTube for the first time, but Safari 14 is yet to get this codec.\nAs AirPlay 2 now supports 4K video streaming on iOS 14 and macOS Big Sur, it makes sense that Apple is committed to enabling such content across all its platforms.\nOMG! Netflix on macOS Big Sur's Safari browser just gave me 4K Stream with Dolby Vision on MacBook Pro! Earlier it was just 1080p with Dolby Vision.
