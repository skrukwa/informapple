        "body": "With the new Safari 11 update, Apple takes an important step to protect your privacy, specifically how your browsing habits are tracked and shared with parties other than the sites you visit. In response, Apple is getting criticized by the advertising industry for \"destroying the Internet's economic model.\" While the advertising industry is trying to shift the conversation to what they call the economic model of the Internet, the conversation must instead focus on the indiscriminate tracking of users and the violation of their privacy.\nWhen you browse the web, you might think that your information only lives in the service you choose to visit. However, many sites load elements that share your data with third parties. First-party cookies are set by the domain you are visiting, allowing sites to recognize you from your previous visits but not to track you across other sites. For example, if you visit first examplemedia.com and then socialmedia.com, your visit would only be known to each site. In contrast, third-party cookies are those set by any other domains than the one you are visiting, and were created to circumvent the original design of cookies. In this case, when you would visit examplemedia.com and it loads tracker.socialmedia.com as well, socialmedia.com would be able to track you an all sites that you visit where its tracker is loaded.\nWebsites commonly use third-party tracking to allow analytics services, data brokerages, and advertising companies to set unique cookies. This data is aggregated into individual profiles and fed into a real-time auction process where companies get to bid for the right to serve an ad to a user when they visit a page. This mechanism can be used for general behavioral advertising but also for \u201cretargeting.\u201d In the latter case, the vendor of a product viewed on one site buys the chance to target the user later with ads for the same product on other sites around the web. As a user, you should be able to expect you will be treated with respect and that your personal browsing habits will be protected. When websites share your behavior without your knowledge, that trust is broken.\nSafari has been blocking third-party cookies by default since Safari 5.1, released in 2010, and has been key to Apple\u2019s emerging identity as a defender of user privacy. Safari distinguished between these seedy cookies from those placed on our machines by first parties - sites we visit intentionally. From 2011 onwards, advertising companies have been devising ways to circumvent these protections. One of the biggest retargeters, Criteo, even acquired a patent on a technique to subvert this protection . Criteo, however, was not the first company to circumvent Safari's user protection. In 2012, Google paid 22.5 million dollars to settle an action by the FTC after they used another workaround to track Safari users with cookies from the DoubleClick Ad Network. Safari had an exception to the third-party ban for submission forms where the user entered data deliberately (e.g. to sign up). Google exploited this loophole when Safari users visited sites participating in Google's advertising network to set a unique cookie.\nThe new Safari update, with Intelligent Tracking Prevention, closes loopholes around third-party cookie-blocking by using machine learning to distinguish the sites a user has a relationship with from those they don\u2019t, and treating the cookies differently based on that. When you visit a site, any cookies that are set can be used in a third-party context for twenty-four hours. During the first twenty-four hours the third-party cookies can be used to track the user, but afterward can only be used to login and not to track. This means that sites that you visit regularly are not significantly affected. The companies this will hit hardest are ad companies unconnected with any major publisher.\nAt EFF we understand the need for sites to build a successful business model, but this should not come at the expense of people's privacy. This is why we launched initiatives like the EFF DNT Policy and tools like Privacy Badger. These initiatives and tools target tracking, not advertising. Rather than attacking Apple for serving their users, the advertising industry should treat this as an opportunity to change direction and develop advertising models that respect (and not exploit) users.\nApple has been a powerful force in user privacy on a mass scale in recent years, as reflected by their support for encryption, the intelligent processing of user data on device rather than in the cloud, and limitations on ad tracking on mobile and desktop. By some estimates, Apple handles 30% of all pages on mobile. Safari's innovations are not the silver bullet that will stop all tracking, but by stepping up to protect their users\u2019 privacy Apple has set a challenge for other browser developers. When the user's privacy interests conflict with the business models of the advertising technology complex, is it possible to be neutral? We hope that Mozilla, Microsoft and Google will follow Apple, Brave and Opera's lead.",

        "title": "Apple Responds to Safari 11 Criticism From Advertising Groups: 'People Have a Right to Privacy'",
        "body": "Six trade and marketing organizations this morning published an open letter to Apple asking the company to \"rethink\" plans to launch new versions of Safari in iOS and macOS that block cross-site tracking, and this afternoon, Apple offered up a response, which was shared by The Loop.\nAccording to Apple, ad tracking companies are essentially able to recreate a person's web browsing history using cross site tracking techniques sans permission, something it's aiming to stop.\n\"Apple believes that people have a right to privacy - Safari was the first browser to block third party cookies by default and Intelligent Tracking Prevention is a more advanced method for protecting user privacy,\" Apple said in a statement provided to The Loop. \"Ad tracking technology has become so pervasive that it is possible for ad tracking companies to recreate the majority of a person's web browsing history. This information is collected without permission and is used for ad re-targeting, which is how ads follow people around the Internet. The new Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature detects and eliminates cookies and other data used for this cross-site tracking, which means it helps keep a person's browsing private. The feature does not block ads or interfere with legitimate tracking on the sites that people actually click on and visit. Cookies for sites that you interact with function as designed, and ads placed by web publishers will appear normally.\"\nIn the open letter, signed by the Data and Marketing Association and the Network Advertising Initiative, among others, the collective \"digital advertising community\" said it is \"deeply concerned\" because the update \"overrides and replaces existing user-controlled cookie preferences\" before going on to suggest that customers prefer targeted ads.\n\"Apple's unilateral and heavy-handed approach is bad for consumer choice and bad for the ad-supported online content and services consumers love,\" reads the letter. \"Blocking cookies in this manner will drive a wedge between brands and their customers, and it will make advertising more generic and less timely and useful.\"\nIn both macOS High Sierra and iOS 11, the Safari web browser is gaining new privacy features to prevent companies from tracking customer web browsing habits across websites. \"The success of the web as a platform relies on user trust,\" Apple says on the WebKit blog. \"Many users feel that trust is broken when they are being tracked and privacy-sensitive data about their web activity is acquired for purposes that they never agreed to.\"\nIn iOS 11, the toggle to turn off cross-site tracking is available by going to Settings --> Safari --> Prevent Cross-Site Tracking. With macOS High Sierra, the feature can be accessed by going to the Preferences section of the Safari app, choosing Privacy, and then checking \"Prevent Cross-Site Tracking.\"\niOS 11 will be released to the public next Tuesday, September 19, while macOS High Sierra will be released on the following Monday, September 25.",

        "title": "TIL Apple products come with at least a partially charged battery because Steve Jobs noticed how consumers were frustrated to not being able to use their new toys because they had to wait to charge them first.",
        "body": "What Steve Jobs Taught Google\u2019s Tony Fadell About Designing Simple Products Greg Ferenstein \u00b7 Follow Published in The Ferenstein Wire \u00b7 \u00b7 Mar 19, 2015 2 min read -- 1 Listen Share\nFlickr user TED Conference\nAt the TED conference in Vancouver this year, one of the main designers of the iPod and founder of Nest, Tony Fadell, gave a few simple tips about creating awesome products. While most of us won\u2019t be working on the next world-wide gadget phenomenon, his tips, especially those from the late great Steve Jobs, seemed delightfully practical for all sorts of projects.\nSince his time at Apple, Fadell has gone on to create the Nest thermostat and is now a lead designer at Google.\n1). \u201cStaying Beginner\u201d\nJobs insisted that his design team \u201cstay beginner\u201d: walk in the shoes of someone who has never experienced a product before. When a new Apple product came out, Fadell would wait in long lines at an Apple store, purchase it at the counter like everyone else, unbox it and try to get it working.\nThough he may have been involved in every aspect of the iPod, taking the trek of the consumer taught him to notice the little frustrations that can destroy an otherwise good idea.\nAs an example, he talked about shipping a product with a charged battery. Only a few years ago, it was all-to-common to unwrap a new MP3 player with the glee of christmas morning, only to find out we had to wait a few hours to charge the device.\nThis is a piss-poor first impression for a product. Now, Apple products, he says, come with at least a partially charged battery. The act of \u201cstaying beginner\u201d helps us see the frustrations that we otherwise resign ourselves to believing are fate.\n\u201cThe more we\u2019re exposed to something,\u201d Fadell said, \u201cthe more we get used to it\u201d.\nBreaking out of the mold by walking in a consumer\u2019s shoes gives a new perspective.\n2). Put Young People on the team\n\u201cIf you have those young minds, they cause everyone to think young,\u201d Fadell said. Young workers\u2019 na\u00efvet\u00e9, he argues, is an asset. They don\u2019t accept all the assumptions that we\u2019ve become habituated to making. Even if their suggestions are completely unrealistic, they force all of the older folks on the team to question unexpected assumptions.\nThe data seems to support this idea that young people can be extraordinary for innovation. This year, there were a record 46 billionaires under the age of 40 on Forbes famous list of the rich and famous, mostly from technology. Snapchat\u2019s Evan Spiegel, for instance, is a billionaire at just 24 years old.\nTechnology and the app economy has given young minds the ability to create products without permission \u2014 and, as a result, many have thrived.\nStaying beginner and staying young: two simple, practical ideas.",

In a statement, the company said it cares deeply about the safety of its users and directed users towards its emergency calling and Medical ID features.\nIt is not possible. iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models do not have FM radio chips in them nor do they have antennas designed to support FM signals \u2014 Philip Schiller (@pschiller) September 28, 2017\nIt also revealed that is technically impossible for iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 to serve as an FM radio anyway, as they lack chips and antennas to support the signal.\nAlthough the statement doesn\u2019t say it directly, it is pretty obvious that Apple is not interested in developing or supporting FM radio features for its devices.\nIn fact, it is taking the argument off the table by designing its newer phones in such a way that it could not add an FM radio even if it wanted to.\nApple does not address the technical feasibility of adding a FM radio to older devices, like the iPhone 6s which it still sells at the Apple Store. Of course, whilst it is believed to be possible on older phones, Apple has shown no interest in enabling terrestrial radio features.\nThe FCC referred to FM\u2019s ability to broadcast information in light of the devastation caused by the recent hurricanes. Apple pointed to the presence of government emergency notifications on iOS, which serve as a reasonable alternative source for the same information. This includes weather warnings and AMBER alerts.\nUsers can check to see if they have these critical alerts enabled by going to Settings \u2192 Notifications on their iPhone and scrolling to the bottom of the list to find the \u2018Government Alerts\u2019 section. Just flick the switches to green to receive these alerts on your lock screen as they come in.\nUsers interested in listening to the radio can use the Radio section in Apple Music or the new Radio app in watchOS 4.1. It includes news stations like NPR as well as the music stations.",

One of the case manufacturers has renamed its own internal SKUs, the code that identifies a company's products.\nWe've been referring to the new standard iPhones as 7S and 7S Plus, not just because of rumours but because of Apple's naming system ever since the iPhone 3GS. Moving on straight to iPhone 8 will mark the first time the 'S' moniker will be skipped.\nThe iPhone Edition meanwhile is set to be a much more premium device, with an all-front OLED screen, advanced facial recognition technology, a dual camera and for the first time on an iPhone, no Touch ID home button. It is also claimed that the iPhone Edition will support Qi wireless charging, although at a reduced rate.\nIt is therefore plausible that this model will have a special name, such as iPhone Edition. It's not the first time we've heard it called something other than iPhone 8, as it has also been referred to as iPhone X.\nWe won't know for sure what Apple intends to call the new models until the official unveiling on 12 September. With the launch being so close, we thought the majority of rumours had dried up, this goes to show that when it comes to Apple, nothing is certain.",

        "body": "Sometimes it's hard to tell exactly how fast technology is moving. \"We put a man on the moon using the computing power of a handheld calculator,\" as Richard Hendricks reminds us in Silicon Valley. In 2017, I use my pocket supercomputer of a phone to tweet with brands.\nBut Apple's iPhone X provides a nice little illustration of how sensor and processing technology has evolved in the past decade. In June 2009, Microsoft unveiled this:\nIn September 2017, Apple put all that tech in this:\nWell, minus the tilt motor.\nMicrosoft's original Kinect hardware was powered by a little-known Israeli company called PrimeSense. PrimeSense pioneered the technology of projecting a grid of infrared dots onto a scene, then detecting them with an IR camera and acsertaining depth information through a special processing chip.\nThe output of the Kinect was a 320 x 240 depth map with 2,048 levels of sensitivity (distinct depths), based on the 30,000-ish laser dots the IR projector blasted onto the scene in a proprietary speckle pattern.\nIn its day, the Kinect was the fastest selling consumer electronics device of all time, while it was also widely regarded as a flop for gaming. But the revolutionary depth-sensing tech ended up being a huge boost for robotics and machine vision.\nIn 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense. Depth cameras continued to evolve: Kinect 2.0 for the Xbox One replaced PrimeSense technology with Microsoft's own tech and had much higher accuracy and resolution. It could recognize faces and even detect a player's heart rate. Meanwhile, Intel also built its own depth sensor, Intel RealSense, and in 2015 worked with Microsoft to power Windows Hello. In 2016, Lenovo launched the Phab 2 Pro, the first phone to carry Google's Tango technology for augmented reality and machine vision, which is also based on infrared depth detection.\nAnd now, in late 2017, Apple is going to sell a phone with a front-facing depth camera. Unlike the original Kinect, which was built to track motion in a whole living room, the sensor is primarily designed for scanning faces and powers Apple\u2019s Face ID feature. Apple\u2019s \u201cTrueDepth\u201d camera blasts \u201cmore than 30,000 invisible dots\u201d and can create incredibly detailed scans of a human face. In fact, while Apple\u2019s Animoji feature is impressive, the developer API behind it is even wilder: Apple generates, in real time, a full animated 3D mesh of your face, while also approximating your face\u2019s lighting conditions to improve the realism of AR applications.",

She posted photos which show damage consistent with a swollen battery.\nA Japanese owner has posted similar photos of his device, which he says arrived in this state \u2026\nThe first device affected is being examined by Apple, reports ifeng (via TNW).\nThe phone belonged to a Ms. Wu, who recently renewed her phone contract and purchased a 64GB rose gold iPhone 8 Plus. The issue emerged five days after purchasing the phone. Wu placed her phone on charge, using the supplied cable and adaptor. After three minutes, she reported seeing the front panel bulge, and eventually lift completely from the device. According to multiple Taiwanese outlets, the phone was later recovered by the carrier, and has since been shipped to Apple for analysis.\nSome media reports are describing it as an \u2018explosion,\u2019 but there is no visible evidence of any burn marks, and much more extensive damage would be expected were this the case.\nThe Japanese owner tweeted photos of the damage to his device.\nWhile any incident affecting a new iPhone model is bound to attract media attention, it\u2019s worth noting the usual disclaimers. First, any device manufactured in the millions will include some faulty models \u2013 the real news would be if this were not the case. Second, investigations into charging-related incidents often reveal that a third-party charger was used, even when an owner initially claims to have used the supplied Apple one.\nAny device with a swollen battery should be immediately removed to a safe place, as it can indicate a lithium battery at risk of bursting into flames.\nWe understand that Apple is aware only of these two instances, and that it always carefully investigates safety-related reports.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

Craig oversees the development of iOS, macOS, and Siri. His teams are responsible for delivering the software at the heart of Apple\u2019s innovative products, including the user interface, applications and frameworks.\nApple's leadership page is only now reflecting Federighi's role as head of Siri, but the transition has been apparent for several months, based on recent interviews and stage appearances at Apple's keynotes.\nAt WWDC 2016, for example, Federighi and Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller joined Daring Fireball's John Gruber to discuss how Apple was opening Siri up to third-party developers with SiriKit later that year.\nAt WWDC 2017, Federighi was on stage to discuss improvements to Siri in iOS 11, including more natural voice, built-in translation capabilities, and advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence.\nCue continues to oversee the iTunes Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, Apple Maps, iCloud, and the iWork and iLife suites of apps, and handing off Siri should allow him to focus more on Apple's push into original content.\nApple's updated leadership page also now lists profiles for recently promoted employees Deirdre O'Brien, Vice President of People, and Isabel Ge Mahe, Vice President and Managing Director of Greater China.",

        "title": "iOS 11 makes it harder for someone else to get data off your phone",
        "body": "If someone takes your iPhone, can they get your data too?\nFor years, Apple has been working to make sure the answer is no. The iPhone\u2019s local storage drive has strong encryption, and without a passcode or a fingerprint, there\u2019s no way to get past the lockscreen. If the phone powers down or goes 48 hours without a login, it locks down even further, requiring a passcode to restart. It\u2019s a huge problem for phone thieves \u2014 and, as the San Bernardino case demonstrated, makes life difficult for law enforcement too. It\u2019s still possible to get cloud data held on Apple servers, and any data controlled by an app is another story \u2014 but if it\u2019s stored locally on your phone, it\u2019s tough to get without your permission.\nWith those protections in place, thieves and digital forensics experts have turned to the iPhone\u2019s automatic backup system as the easiest way through. If your phone has registered your computer as a trusted device, it\u2019s possible to trigger an automatic backup from the computer itself, which basically dumps all the phone\u2019s data onto the computer in a nice package for investigators. Even if the computer isn\u2019t a trusted device, all you need to establish a trusted device is a fingerprint login, which you could potentially spoof or 3D-print. Once you\u2019ve made that login, you can pair the phone, dump the data, and start picking through.\nYou won\u2019t be able to establish a pair with just a fingerprint; you\u2019ll need the full passcode\nIn some ways, this sounds a lot like logging into the phone \u2014 but it gives a lot more access for a much longer span of time. Once a computer is registered as a trusted device for a particular phone, the computer can pull backups off that phone at any time in the future, even without logging in.\nThe process for establishing a trusted device is already a bit daunting \u2014 but with iOS 11, that system will get just a little bit tighter. A new post from ElcomSoft (which makes the forensic software that pulls data off those paired phones) details an overlooked feature in iOS 11 that will make that system a little bit harder to crack. Now, you won\u2019t be able to establish a pair with just a fingerprint; you\u2019ll need the full passcode, just as if you were unlocking the phone after a hard reset. It seems minor, but it\u2019s potentially a serious problem for police, who are legally allowed to compel fingerprints but move into trickier legal territory when it comes to passcodes.\nIn the abstract, this is all something of a moot point. If you\u2019re spoofing fingerprints, you\u2019ve got enough to log into the phone itself (as long as it\u2019s not locked down), at which point you can just open apps and get the data you need anyway. But backing up the phone to a trusted device is a huge part of modern forensics, and it\u2019s one of the few ways for investigators to be sure they\u2019ve gotten every piece of data they could. Under iOS 11, it will be harder to do that without the user\u2019s permission, turning up the heat ever so slightly on the encryption debate.",

        "body": "Apple's new Face ID facial recognition feature will work with most sunglasses, according to Apple software engineering chief Craig Federighi.\n\"Most sunglasses let through enough IR light that Face ID can see your eyes even when the glasses appear to be opaque. It's really amazing!\" Federighi said in an email to MacRumors reader and developer Keith Krimbel (@yokeremote and @keithkrimbel on Twitter) who emailed the Apple exec with a list of questions this morning.\nWhile Apple's Face ID coverage has specifically said the feature works with hats, scarves, beards, glasses, makeup, and other items that might obscure the face, sunglasses were not specifically mentioned. Federighi's answer clears up one of the last major unknowns about Face ID.\nKrimbel also asked for details on what would prevent a thief from taking the iPhone X, pointing it at his face, and running off. In response, Federighi says there are two mitigations in place. \"If you don't stare at the phone, it won't unlock,\" he wrote. \"Also, if you grip the buttons on both sides of the phone when [you] hand it over, it will temporarily disable Face ID.\"\nIn addition to answering these questions, Federighi also commented on the now highly-publicized on-stage Face ID gaffe that saw the feature fail to recognize his face. According to Apple, the software failed because someone else had picked up the phone ahead of Federighi's demo. Federighi says it's not really an issue he had encountered before.\nThe bio-lockout that I experienced on stage would require several interacts by other people with your phone (where they woke up the phone). For those of us who have been living on the iPhone X over the last months this has never been a real problem (hence my shock when it happened to me on stage! :-)\nThe Face ID facial recognition feature is designed to replace Touch ID as the new de facto biometric authentication system. While it's limited to the iPhone X at this time, Apple has said it is the future of how we will unlock our smartphones.\nFor more on how Face ID scans your face, whether it can be fooled, how it works with Apple Pay, and the built-in privacy features, make sure to check out our Face ID post that covers all of the ins and outs of the new feature.",

        "title": "iPhone X: Six core A11 Fusion chip, wireless charging hints, Apple Pay + Face ID details, more",
        "body": "Update: Steve Troughton Smith clarifies the processor information:\nJust to clarify on the A11: it's two high-power Monsoon cores and four low-power Mistral cores, all independently addressable. No Fusion \u2014 Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) September 10, 2017\nLeaks continue today from the iOS 11 GM. Yesterday, we told you about iPhone X details such as the Face ID setup process, and now a handful of more details have emerged related to wireless charging, camera improvements, and more\u2026\nWhile several reports have highlighted that the iPhone X will support wireless charging, the iOS 11 GM further corroborates that. Code strings show a few mentions of wireless charging in the ChargingViewService app. The strings here hint at some 3D animations that will show when the device is charging via wireless charging.\nPerhaps most notably, however, is that the code suggests that the new A11 Fusion chip is a six core processor. It appears as if Apple will pack four high performance, or \u201cMistral,\u201d cores and two battery life efficient \u201cMonsson\u201d cores.\nFor comparison\u2019s sake, the A10 Fusion processor in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus pack two high performance cores and two high-efficiency cores. Meanwhile, the A10X in the iPad Pro features a 3+3 setup. This means that the new iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X will be Apple\u2019s most powerful iOS device by wide margin. Of course, one important thing to note here is that performance partially will depend on the clock speed of the processors, but either way we\u2019re looking at a dramatic jump.\nAs far as the camera goes, the iOS 11 GM suggests that the iPhone 8 and iPhone X will support 4K video at 60 FPS, as well as 1080p video at 240 FPS. It was initially believed that these camera improvements would only apply to the flagship iPhone X, but the iOS 11 GM suggests it will come to both the iPhone 8 and iPhone X.\nFurthermore, it\u2019s now believed that the new Portrait Lighting features will be available on both the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. As we reported yesterday, Portrait Lighting features settings for things like Contour Light, Natural Light, Stage Light, Stage Light Mono, and Studio Light. This feature will likely be related to flash and lighting during Portrait Mode shots.\nThe iOS 11 GM also offers a bit more information about the side power button, which is believed to be much larger on the iPhone X than on previous devices. It appears as if the power button will be integral to the Apple Pay process as Face ID will passively authenticate the payment, but you\u2019ll have to double click the power button to confirm it.\nThe same code also hints that Face ID will come to the iPad at some point down the line. While this is likely a case of Apple future proofing the code, it\u2019s still notable as it\u2019s likely a look at what\u2019s to come with next year\u2019s iPad upgrades.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg\nChargingViewService confirms wireless charging. It will even show some 3D animations when charging (not present in GM tho) pic.twitter.com/JLBd4HQLpS \u2014 Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) September 10, 2017\n4K 60fps and 1080p 240fps strings are also inside a generic \"d2x\" file. Probably will be available on iPhone 8 and X as well. pic.twitter.com/0p8CEOlBnM \u2014 Filipe Esp\u00f3sito \uf8ff (@filipekids) September 10, 2017\nA11 Fusion is a 4+2 core device https://t.co/mqtIKcjBmG \u2014 Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) September 10, 2017\nAnd it appears that Face ID occurs automatically but you double click the side button to confirm payment pic.twitter.com/NcN0u9KKTt \u2014 Jeffrey Grossman (@Jeffrey903) September 10, 2017",

        "title": "iPhone 8 Is World's Fastest Phone (It's Not Even Close)",
        "body": "Update 12/21: We've added results from the iPhone X.\nThe \"Bionic\" part in the name of Apple's A11 Bionic chip isn't just marketing speak. It's the most powerful processor ever put in a mobile phone. We've put this chip -- which powers the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X -- to the test in both synthetic benchmarks and some real-world speed trials, and it obliterates every Android phone we tested.\nAs a quick primer, the A11 Bionic is a six-core CPU, with two performance cores that promise a 25-percent boost in performance and four high-efficiency cores that promise up to a 70-percent improvement over the iPhone 7's A10 Fusion chip. Last but not least is an Apple-designed GPU that's supposed to be 30 percent faster than before.\nLet's start with Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance. On the multicore portion of this test, the iPhone 8 hit 10,170. That's 54 percent faster than the score from Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 \u2014 currently the fastest Android phone. The iPhone X scored 10,357 on the same test.\nThe Android competition wasn't close. The Note 8 scored 6,564, and that's with an impressive 6GB of RAM paired with Qualcomm's fast Snapdragon 835 chip. How about the OnePlus 5 and its 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 835? That handset got 6,542. With 4GB of RAM, the Galaxy S8 scored 6,295 with the same processor.\nThe iPhone 8 even edged out the score from the 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro with a 7th-generation Core i5 processor. That notebook notched 9,213. Is Geekbench 4 really comparable from phone to desktop? According to the founder of Geekbench, John Poole, \u201cthe short is answer is yes that the scores are comparable across platforms, so if an iPhone 8 scores higher than an i5, then the iPhone 8 is faster than the i5.\u201d\nMORE: iPhone 8 Plus vs. Galaxy Note 8 Camera Face-Off - Why Apple Wins\nHowever, Poole provided the important caveat that laptops are better at delivering sustained performance over a longer period of time, as opposed to the shorter max burst performance that benchmarks like Geekbench 4 are designed to measure. In other words, the iPhone 8 simply doesn\u2019t have the thermals and heat dissipation necessary to replace your laptop.\nNext up is 3DMark, which gauges graphics performance. The iPhone 8 scored an off-the-charts 62,212, and the iPhone 8 Plus managed an even higher 64,412. Compare that to the Note 8's 39,834 and the OnePlus 5's 39,576.\nIf you're wondering how all this translates to real-world performance, we have more good news for iPhone 8 shoppers \u2014 and bad news for everyone else. To really put the A11 Bionic chip through its paces, we put the same 2-minute video, shot in 4K by a drone, on the iPhone 8, Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S8+, and then added the same transitions and effects before exporting and saving the video.\nThe iPhone 8 and iPhone X finished this strenuous task in just 42 seconds, while the Note 8 took more than 3 minutes. The Galaxy S8+ took more than 4 minutes.\nHow about opening a large file? We downloaded a 5.1 MB map illustration PDF to both the iPhone 8 and Galaxy Note 8 and opened them from their native file managers: the Apple Files app and the My Files app. The iPhone 8 averaged under 0.8 seconds, while the Note 8 averaged 6.41 seconds.\nThe iPhone 8 also opened more demanding apps faster than its predecessor and the top Android phone right now, although those differences were less dramatic. It took the iPhone 8 11 seconds to fully load the Injustice 2 game, compared to 14.53 seconds for the iPhone 7 Plus and 19 seconds for the Note 8.\nOf course, there are lots of ways to measure performance, but based on our testing thus far, the iPhone 8 is easily the fastest phone ever. Now everyone else has to play catchup.\nIllustration: Tom's Guide/Shutterstock",

        "body": "Apple isn't expected to catch up to iPhone X demand before first half of 2018\nIf you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nApple is poised to be able to ship about 40 million iPhone X units before the end of 2017, which won't be nearly enough to meet consumer demand for the redesigned handset with edge-to-edge OLED display, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nKuo, of KGI Securities, issued a note to investors on Friday, a copy of which was obtained by AppleInsider, offering positive reactions to the iPhone X unveiling earlier this week. Specifically, he believes that Apples facial recognition technology will set it apart from competitors, and the full-screen design and augmented reality advantages with iPhone X will further drive sales.\nIt's really just a question of how quickly Apple will be able to produce the iPhone X, as Kuo believes Apple won't be able to meet market demand before the first half of 2018.\nFurther, while he previously thought Apple might be able to build as many as 50 million iPhone X units before the end of this year, he has slashed that number down to about 40 million.\nAny handsets Apple is unable to build this year just translate to sales next year, however. Accordingly, Kuo has increased his 2018 shipment estimates to between 80 million and 90 million iPhone X units.\nRegarding Face ID, Kuo believes Apple's proprietary structured light technology will be able to provide a level of security that is consistent and acceptable. And he also said that users will be delighted with facial recognition capabilities integrated into new features like Animoji.\nHe also said that the iPhone X has the highest screen-to-body ratio on the market, which could make it the most appealing edge-to-edge handset available to consumers.\nAnd Apple's ARKit and new cameras and sensors on the iPhone X give it a significant lead in AR, marrying software and hardware integration into an experience that will be difficult for competitors to replicate.\nKuo cautioned that some investors may be concerned about market acceptance of both Face ID and the $999 starting price of the iPhone X. He doesn't share those same concerns looking longterm, however.\n\"Amid mixed market views, we expect shares of the Apple supply chain to be volatile or even corrected in the near future,\" he wrote. \"We recommend investors seize the opportunity to accumulate supply chain shares.\"\nBottlenecks for Apple and production of the iPhone X are said to include the new OLED edge-to-edge display, as well as the advanced front facing camera array that enables Face ID. Previously, Kuo indicated that Apple's current production levels of the iPhone X are limited to less than 10,000 units per day.",

        "body": "Apple is closing in on its aim to achieve supply/demand balance for its AirPods, with the popular earphones now shipping from the online Apple Store in just three to five business days in the United States, Canada, U.K., Australia, and several other countries around the world.\nAccording to Apple's U.S. website, AirPods ordered today will be delivered between October 4 and October 6, while U.K. customers ordering today are being quoted delivery dates between October 3 and October 5. These are the best estimates Apple has offered since the AirPods launched in December 2016.\nAirPods have been in extremely short supply since they became available for purchase, with a typical wait time of six weeks from order to delivery. Only in August did stock begin steadily improving, with shipping estimates dropping to four weeks and then two to three weeks. Earlier this month, estimates improved to one to two weeks, before hitting three to five business days today.\nDuring Apple's third quarter earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Apple had boosted AirPods production capacity and was \"working very hard\" to get AirPods to customers as quickly as possible.\nOccasionally, Apple retail stores have received stock and third-party retailers like Best Buy have been able to offer AirPods with faster shipping on a regular basis, but those stocks have usually run out fast.\nCosting $159, Apple's \"truly wireless\" AirPods have gained popularity due to their long battery life, capacious charge case, infrared sensors that detect when they're being worn, touch-based gestures, and a built-in W1 chip that improves Bluetooth connection. AirPods are also relatively inexpensive compared to rival \"truly wireless\" earbuds that have launched in recent months.",

We will be bringing it back in an upcoming iOS 11.x update.\nThanks (and sorry for the inconvenience)!\n- craig\nOn devices that support 3D Touch running iOS 9 or iOS 10, users can press deeply on the left side of the screen, drag to the right, and release to quickly access the App Switcher. The gesture stopped working in the iOS 11 beta, and an Apple engineer later confirmed it was \"intentionally removed.\"\nMacRumors has verified this email exchange passed through mail servers with an IP address range linked to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. Coupled with the fact Federighi has been replying to several customer emails since the iPhone X event last week, we're fairly confident in its accuracy.\nFederighi replies have also revealed that Face ID will work with most sunglasses and that Apple has considered a Nightstand mode for iPhone X.",

        "title": "Apple Faces Renewed Pressure to Enable FM Radio Chip in iPhones Amid Strong Hurricane Season",
        "body": "A series of powerful storms over the past six weeks, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, has placed renewed pressure on Apple to enable the FM radio capabilities of the wireless modem in every iPhone.\nThe biggest push continues to come from the National Association of Broadcasters, a lobbying group that represents over-the-air radio and television broadcasters in the United States, according to Bloomberg.\n\"Broadcasters are providing information on how to evacuate quickly, where flood waters are raging, how to get out of harm\u2019s way if there's a tornado or a hurricane,\" said Dennis Wharton, a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcasters. \"The notion that Apple or anyone else would block this type of information is something that we find fairly troubling.\"\nBoth the Qualcomm and Intel chips that enable Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity in every iPhone have a built-in FM tuner that would allow people to listen to FM radio over the air. Apple has not enabled the functionality, forcing users to use an app to stream FM radio over Wi-Fi or cellular data.\nPowerful storms can leave thousands or millions of people without power or cellular service for weeks or even months, however, which can make it difficult or impossible to listen to FM radio over Wi-Fi or cellular.\nFCC chairman Ajit Pai also renewed his calls for smartphone manufacturers to enable the chip during a recent trip to areas of southern Florida devastated by Hurricane Irma earlier this month, according to the report.\nPai, speaking with ABC affiliate WPBF 25 in West Palm Beach, said the chip is especially valuable \"when it's an emergency.\"\n\"The FM chip is a valuable functionality, not just when times are good or when it helps you save battery life or reduces congestion on the wireless network, but especially when it's an emergency. People want to tune in to the radio broadcast and get emergency information and this can be a valuable way of doing that,\" said Pai.\nIn February, at the Future of Radio and Audio Symposium in Washington D.C., Pai said \"radio is vital\" when disaster strikes.\nWhen disaster strikes, often knocking out cell networks and Internet service, over-the-air radio is a lifeline, providing the latest weather forecasts or directions on where to seek shelter or relief assistance. After hurricanes or tornadoes or fires or floods, time and again, we see an exponential surge in radio audiences.\nHe added that most consumers would enjoy the ability to access free content over the air, like music on FM radio stations, which some critics believe is a key reason why Apple hasn't enabled the functionality.\nIt seems odd that every day we hear about a new smartphone app that lets you do something innovative, yet these modern-day mobile miracles don't enable a key function offered by a 1982 Sony Walkman. You could make a case for activating chips on public safety grounds alone. The former head of our Federal Emergency Management Administration has spoken out in support of this proposal. [\u2026] Moreover, most consumers would love to access some of their favorite content over-the-air, while using one-sixth of the battery life and less data. As more and more Americans use activated FM chips in their smartphones, consumer demand for smartphones with activated FM chips should continue to increase.\nPai noted that he is a believer in free markets and the rule of law, and he thereby cannot support a government mandate requiring activation of these chips, nor does he believe the FCC has the power to issue such a mandate.\nApple declined to comment on the report, and its stance on the activation of FM receivers in iPhones remains unclear.\nUpdate: FCC chairman Ajit Pai has issued a statement that directly calls on Apple to \"step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first\" by activating the FM radio chip in iPhones, in light of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\nIn recent years, I have repeatedly called on the wireless industry to activate the FM chips that are already installed in almost all smartphones sold in the United States. And I've specifically pointed out the public safety benefits of doing so. In fact, in my first public speech after I became Chairman, I observed that \u2018[y]ou could make a case for activating chips on public safety groundsalone.\u2019 When wireless networks go down during a natural disaster, smartphones with activated FM chips can allow Americans to get vital access to life-saving information. I applaud those companies that have done the right thing by activating the FM chips in their phones. Apple is the one major phone manufacturer that has resisted doing so. But I hope the company will reconsider its position, given the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. That's why I am asking Apple to activate the FM chips that are in its iPhones. It is time for Apple to step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first. As the Sun Sentinel of South Florida put it, 'Do the right thing, Mr. Cook. Flip the switch. Lives depend on\nit.'\"\nUpdate 2: MacRumors has received the following statement from an Apple spokesperson:\nApple cares deeply about the safety of our users, especially during times of crisis and that's why we have engineered modern safety solutions into our products. Users can dial emergency services and access Medical ID card information directly from the Lock Screen, and we enable government emergency notifications, ranging from Weather Advisories to AMBER alerts. iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models do not have FM radio chips in them nor do they have antennas designed to support FM signals, so it is not possible to enable FM reception in these products.\nWe'll update this article if the FCC responds to Apple's statement.",

        "body": "Following today's event that saw the introduction of the iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, Apple Watch Series 3, and 4K Apple TV, Apple has quietly raised the prices on all of its 256 and 512GB iPad Pro models.\nAll 256 and 512GB 10.5 and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models are $50 more expensive. For the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, Apple now charges $649 for the 64GB model, $799 for the 256GB model, and $999 for the 512GB model.\nFor the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, Apple charges $799 for the 64GB model, $949 for the 256GB model, and $1149 for the 512GB model. All cellular models are an additional $130 over the above listed prices.\nPrior to today, 12.9-inch iPad Pro pricing was $799/$899/$1099 for the 64/256/512GB models, while 10.5-inch iPad Pro pricing was $649/$749/$949.\nIt is not clear why Apple has decided to raise the prices on its iPad Pro models, but prices could be increasing due to increased costs for memory.\nBest Buy has already updated its iPad Pro pricing to reflect price increase, but other sites have not yet done so. If you plan to purchase a higher-capacity iPad Pro, now is the time to do it at a site that still offers the original price.

        "title": "The iPhones 8",
        "body": "The iPhones 8\nI was tempted to write this review under the conceit that there was no such thing as the iPhone X. Just don\u2019t even mention the iPhone X, and consider the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus as though they were the only two new phones coming from Apple this year. That conceit would work, insofar as the iPhones 8 are excellent year-over-year upgrades compared to their iPhone 7 counterparts.\nBut ignoring the iPhone X would actually do an injustice to the 8 and 8 Plus, because so much of what is inside the X is also inside the 8\u2019s. These phones are in no way shape or form1 some sort of half-hearted or minor update over the iPhone 7.\nThe Outside: Design and Display\nThese new iPhones look and feel great. I\u2019ve been testing a silver iPhone 8 and gold iPhone 8 Plus since last Wednesday. Whether you like the way their polished back glass looks is subjective, but I like it a lot. Feel-wise, there\u2019s no question in my mind that glass is better than aluminum. My personal iPhone 7 that I\u2019ve been using for the last 11 months, however, is the jet black model, which in hand feels very similar to the glass of the iPhones 8. With both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 in my pocket I can\u2019t tell them apart by feel, but that\u2019s only because my 7 has the jet black finish.\nI\u2019ve never owned a Plus-sized iPhone, and last year my review unit did not have the jet black finish, so I found the 8 Plus with glass back to be a revelation. I prefer it so much to any previous Plus-sized iPhone I\u2019ve tested that it almost feels like a different form factor, not just a different material. I\u2019ve always found the Plus unwieldy, and part of that is that aluminum is slippery enough that, combined with the size of the device, it just felt like something I had to consciously think about to avoid dropping. However, just like the jet black aluminum finish, the polished glass back of these new phones is grippier. That grippiness is a nice feature for the 4.7-inch size, but for the Plus, I think it\u2019s a necessity \u2014 it makes it far more pleasant to hold and use.\nThis is the fourth Plus-sized iPhone Apple has made, and it\u2019s the first time that I personally would seriously consider buying one. (I probably would have thought the same thing if I had tested a Plus with the jet black finish last year, though. The difference for me is all about the grippiness.)\nHere\u2019s what I wrote about about the jet black aluminum finish last year:\nI\u2019ve spent the last five days testing one iPhone of each finish: a jet black iPhone 7 and a matte black iPhone 7 Plus. On Friday I devoted an entire piece \u2014 \u201cBlack vs. Jet Black\u201d \u2014 to help pre-orderers decide between the two, based on my initial impressions. Long story short, my initial impression was that black looked better, and jet black felt better. I stand behind my initial description of jet black as the grippiest iPhone Apple has ever made. I also stand by my prediction that Apple wasn\u2019t joking around about the footnote on the iPhone 7 web page: The high-gloss finish of the jet black iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process. Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use. If you are concerned about this, we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iPhone. After just five days \u2014 more than half of which I\u2019ve spent using the matte black iPhone 7 Plus \u2014 this jet black iPhone 7 has a few \u201cmicro abrasions\u201d, to use Apple\u2019s own term. I can only see them when I\u2019m looking for them, and only when I reflect light off the surface at the perfect angle, but they\u2019re there. This is after two days of careful use, and never putting it in a pocket that contains anything else. The back surface of this phone shows more wear after (effectively) two days of use than my space gray 6S does after nearly a year.\nAfter six days of daily use, this iPhone 8 shows no scratches or \u201cmicro-abrasions\u201d whatsoever. With a wipe on my shirt to remove fingerprints, it could pass for mint new-in-box condition. The iPhone 8 Plus I\u2019ve been testing has not been in my pocket every day, but it too looks flawless.\nI don\u2019t mind the micro-abrasions on my jet black iPhone. After nearly a year of daily use, almost all of it sans case, its back is covered with these fine scratches. That\u2019s what I expected based on Apple\u2019s warning last year. There\u2019s no such warning from Apple this year. I think these glass backs are going to hold up nicely.\nColor-wise, I can\u2019t say much about space gray, since I don\u2019t have one to test. But that\u2019s the one I\u2019d buy if I were going to buy an iPhone 8, because I always prefer black or space gray or whatever name Apple is calling the black one this year. But the silver looks nice, and the new gold is very interesting. Rather than two golds \u2014 a yellow gold and a pink rose gold \u2014 Apple has honed in on one true gold this year, a sort of slightly rosy gold. The back glass panel is a sort of taupe. It looks like a slightly different color under different lighting conditions.\nA lot of people out there have been asking me who the iPhone 8 is for, other than people who can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to spend $999 or more on an iPhone X. One group, I think are people who\u2019ll want this gold color.2\nNow, everything I\u2019ve written about what\u2019s new about the exterior of the iPhone 8 is moot if you put your phone in a case, and from what I\u2019ve observed, I\u2019d guess 90-95 percent of iPhones in use are in cases. Some cases have clear backs, which do show the color and design of an iPhone\u2019s back. I think it must be so weird to be a hardware designer at Apple, though, working to make these devices that look beautiful, knowing that 90+ percent of the people who buy them will put them in a case within minutes of unboxing them and never take the case off.\nIn a lot of ways, I think the iPhone 4/4S design was the pinnacle of the iPhone\u2019s perfection. No camera bumps, no notches. So much symmetry, including a symmetric feel between the front face and back, because both were made of glass. Those backs were prone to shattering when dropped, and I\u2019ve always suspected that\u2019s what led them to switch to an aluminum unibody case with the iPhone 5. We\u2019ll see how durable this new \u201cmost durable glass ever in a smartphone\u201d is (those are Apple\u2019s own words), but in terms of look and feel, I\u2019m glad glass is back.\nA11 Bionic Chip\nI asked Apple last week what exactly was \u201cbionic\u201d about the A11 chip system. The answer, translated from Apple marketing-speak to plain English, is that The Bionic Man and Woman were cool, and the A11 chip is very cool. I think they\u2019ve started giving these chips names in addition to numbers (last year\u2019s was the A10 Fusion) because the numbers alone belie the true nature of how significant the improvements in these chips are. Going from A10 to A11 is like going from 10 to 11 mathematically, which implies a 10 percent improvement. That\u2019s not the case at all here \u2014 the A11 is way more than a 10 percent improvement over the A10. So they\u2019ve given it a name like \u201cBionic\u201d to emphasize just how powerful it is.\nI wrote about the A11 Bionic chip last week in my thoughts and observations on the event, and I don\u2019t have much more to say here, but I\u2019ll repeat this line:\nThe specs aren\u2019t what matters \u2014 the effects are what matters. But the specs are what we can measure, and the faster the chips are, the better the effects are in the user experience.\nApple isn\u2019t using the power of the A11 simply to make the things older iPhones do faster. They\u2019re using it to power new features, like the lighting effects in Portrait mode on the 8 Plus and the various machine learning stuff.\nCameras\nSix days is not a lot of time to spend with a new phone, let alone two new phones. Photography is one area where I don\u2019t yet have a handle on how much better these iPhones are than their predecessors. The lighting effects in Portrait mode, though, are interesting. This feature is still in \u201cbeta\u201d, but man, I\u2019ve already taken some shots of my wife and son that I just love. There have also been a few where the edges of their hair have confused the hell out of the iPhone\u2019s depth sensing. But the original Portrait mode last year shipped in similar state, and got better quickly. When it works, though, it\u2019s amazing. (And when it doesn\u2019t work well, you can always revert to the plain no-lighting-effect Portrait mode shot, with nothing lost.)\nFrom a high-level perspective, a camera is three things: a lens, a shutter, and a surface on which to focus the image. That surface used to be film; today it\u2019s a digital sensor.3 For the most part, if you wanted to improve the image quality, you had to improve (or change) the lens or the film. Over the decades, there were breakthroughs based on electronics \u2014 automatic focus and exposure are the ones that spring to my mind \u2014 but the biggest technical factors in photography were based on the simple physics of light passing through a lens and being focused onto a sensor surface.\nWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that some of the camera improvements Apple is talking about with the iPhone 8 aren\u2019t about that. Yes, the sensor has been improved, and is apparently even better at capturing colors in a wide color gamut. But the advances in phone photography are driven more by computing \u2014 both hardware and software \u2014 than by advances in lens optics or sensors. There\u2019s just not much more that can happen between such small lenses and sensors. The real action is in hardware and software.\nHere\u2019s one example from the iPhone 8, in Apple\u2019s own words:\nThe intelligent, Apple-designed image signal processor in the A11 Bionic chip detects elements in a scene \u2014 like people, motion, and lighting conditions \u2014 to optimize your photos before you even take them. It also delivers advanced pixel processing, wide color capture, faster autofocus, and better HDR photos.\nApple is so confident in their improvements to HDR that with the iPhone 8, by default HDR is simply engaged automatically, and iOS no longer stores separate HDR and non-HDR images. HDR just turns on when iOS thinks you need it, and it simply leaves one image in your camera roll. The Settings app has options to enable manual HDR mode and to save HDR and non-HDR versions of images, but until I run into a problem, I\u2019m sticking with the defaults. HDR is no longer something I need to think about.\nCharging\nIn addition to the fact that the glass backs look and feel nicer, they also allowed Apple to add inductive charging to the iPhones 8 \u2014 a feature the industry and, alas, Apple itself insists upon calling \u201cwireless charging\u201d. Don\u2019t get me started. Inductive charging is not wireless. But it is nice. Apple supplied me with a review unit of Belkin\u2019s $60 wireless charging pads. Other reviewers were given Mophie\u2019s, which is also $60. It\u2019s convenient and works great. Design-wise the Belkin pad is what it is \u2014 it looks Belkin-y. My biggest complaint is that the plug that goes into the wall is enormous and ugly. I\u2019ll probably buy the Mophie one simply because I prefer black to white, and their wall plug has to be better than Belkin\u2019s.\nI\u2019m glad Apple decided to support the Qi (pronounced \u201cchee\u201d) standard, which several Android handsets already support. This is an area where Apple has been behind its competition. You know how like 10 years ago, hotels started buying bedside alarm clocks with built-in 30-pin iPod docks? And then they were rendered useless when the iPhone switched to Lightning? And how those Lightning docks are utterly useless to Android users? If they start switching to Qi charging pads, it\u2019ll just work for everyone, and that\u2019s a good thing.\nThe iPhones 8 also now support \u201chigh-speed charging\u201d when you connect them to a Lightning cable attached to a high-wattage charger. In the box, both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus both still come with the same rinky-dink 5-watt charger that all iPhones have shipped with since 2008\u2019s iPhone 3G. iPhones have long charged faster when connected to one of the larger 10- or 12-watt chargers that ship with iPads.4 I went out and bought one of Apple\u2019s 29-watt chargers that ship with the MacBook ($49 bucks, not cheap). I also bought a USB-C to Lightning cable ($25 for 1 meter, $35 for 2 meters \u2014 also not cheap). Anker makes a 30-watt USB-C charger that sells for under $30, but I figured I\u2019d test fast-charging with Apple\u2019s kit.\nThe bottom line: it\u2019s faster, yes, but not that much faster. I ran the iPhone 8 battery down until it powered off. I plugged it into the 29-watt charger, and got the following results: after 15 minutes it was back to 27 percent, at 30 minutes it was at 54 percent, and at 45 minutes it was at 72 percent. But then I did the same thing with my year-old iPhone 7. After 30 minutes it was at 43 percent, and at 45 minutes it was at 65 percent. (I didn\u2019t pay attention to where it was at after 15 minutes.) The iPhone 8 does charge faster than an iPhone 7, but not by much.\nDisplay\nThere\u2019s one major difference between these displays and those of the iPhones 7 \u2014 True Tone. This is a feature where the device uses a 4-channel ambient light sensor to detect the color temperature of your surroundings. It then adjusts the color temperature of the display to match. I love True Tone. Back in March 2016, Apple introduced the first True Tone device: the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Describing the feature, Phil Schiller said something to the effect of \u201cOnce you get used to it, you can\u2019t go back.\u201d I took this as a sign that it would be coming in the iPhone 7 last year, too. It didn\u2019t.\nBut the iPhones 8 have it now, and it\u2019s great. True Tone, though, is the sort of feature that you don\u2019t notice, but rather that you notice the absence of in other devices. It ruins you. When I flew home last week, I spent the first few hours of my flight using the iPhone 8. I find phones to be convenient devices on planes \u2014 and the flaky nature of in-flight Wi-Fi is a good stress test for battery life. Two or three hours into the flight, I needed to check something on my personal iPhone 7 \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what it was exactly, but it was something from an app I didn\u2019t have installed on the review unit. When I took my iPhone 7 out of my pocket, my first thought was \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the display, why is everything gross and blue?\u201d Then I remembered: True Tone.\n(Battery life, by the way, has been fine. 4 hours into my flight last week and the iPhone 8 was still at 50 percent \u2014 that was pretty much non-stop use.)\nConclusion\nThe pricing has changed slightly since last year. Last year\u2019s entry model iPhone 7 cost $649. This year\u2019s 64 GB iPhone 8 costs $699. Apple, of course, has no explanation for this. But RAM prices have gone up so much in the last year that it\u2019s probably the biggest reason.\nEach phone comes in two sizes: 64 GB and 256 GB. The iPhone 8 costs $699 and $849; the Plus $799 and $949. I like this change from three sizes to just two. And even more than that, I like that after years of languishing with 16 GB base models, Apple has quickly moved to 64 GB as the base model capacity.\nNo one is going to describe the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus as having a radical new design. But they do have new glass backs that are the biggest change to their finishings since this general form factor started with the iPhone 6. The displays have gained True Tone. The cameras are significantly improved, both for still images and video. (Did I mention that both the 8 and 8 Plus can shoot true 4K video at 60 frames per second when you use the new HEVC format instead of the more compatible H.264?) The iPhone 8 Plus gets the new Portrait mode lighting effects. Both phones have the amazing A11 Bionic chip. They get inductive charging.\nThese are solid year-over-year updates \u2014 at least as impressive as the iPhone 7 was over the iPhone 6S. If they hadn\u2019t debuted alongside the iPhone X we\u2019d be arguing about whether these are the most impressive new iPhone models since the iPhone 6. There\u2019s a lot to love about them and nothing to dislike.\nBut they did debut alongside the iPhone X, and because of that almost nobody is excited about them. There\u2019s no use pretending otherwise.\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s just as instructive to compare the iPhones 8 to the iPhone X as it is to compare them to the iPhones 7. The iPhone X certainly has much to offer: the edge-to-edge 5.8-inch OLED display, the form factor that\u2019s easier to hold and pocket than the Plus, the front-facing sensor array for Face ID and depth mapping with the front-facing camera, and an even better camera system on the back (with optical image stabilization for both lenses \u2014 the iPhone 8 Plus only has OIS for the wide angle lens). But the A11 chip (including the improved image processing that I described above), inductive charging, True Tone \u2014 all of these things in the iPhone X are also in both iPhone 8 models.\nPretty good for a boring update.",
