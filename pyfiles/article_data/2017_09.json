        "title": "Apple switches from Bing to Google for Siri web search results on iOS and Spotlight on Mac",
        "body": "Apple is switching the default provider of its web searches from Siri, Search inside iOS (formerly called Spotlight) and Spotlight on the Mac. So, for instance, if Siri falls back to a web search on iOS when you ask it a question, you\u2019re now going to get Google results instead of Bing. Updated below with a statement from Microsoft.\nConsistency is Apple\u2019s main motivation given for switching the results from Microsoft\u2019s Bing to Google in these cases. Safari on Mac and iOS already currently use Google search as the default provider, thanks to a deal worth billions to Apple (and Google) over the last decade. This change will now mirror those results when Siri, the iOS Search bar or Spotlight is used.\n\u201cSwitching to Google as the web search provider for Siri, Search within iOS and Spotlight on Mac will allow these services to have a consistent web search experience with the default in Safari,\u201d reads an Apple statement sent this morning. \u201cWe have strong relationships with Google and Microsoft and remain committed to delivering the best user experience possible.\u201d\nThis will change on iOS for the \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking but here are web results\u2019 Siri behavior as well as intentional \u2018hey, Siri, search the web for\u2026\u2019 queries.\nThe search results include regular \u2018web links\u2019 as well as video results. Web image results from Siri will still come from Bing, for now. Bing has had more than solid image results for some time now so that makes some sense. If you use Siri to search your own photos, it will, of course, use your own library instead. Interestingly, video results will come directly from YouTube.\nAll of the search results that you see in these different cases will come directly from the search API, which means you\u2019ll be getting the raw, ranked search results that start below all of the ads and Knowledge Graph stuff that appears on a regular Google home page. Worth noting, of course, that once you\u2019ve clicked on a YouTube video, you\u2019re still going to get served ads, so there is a revenue driver here for Google, even if it\u2019s not direct.\nAs is expected with Apple now, searches and results are all encrypted and anonymized and cannot be attributed to any individual user. Once you click on the \u2018Show Google results\u2019 link, of course, you\u2019re off to Google and its standard tracking will apply. Clicking directly on a website result will take you straight there, not through Google.\nThe timing of this rollout is interesting, coming after iOS has been released, but makes some sense given that High Sierra is releasing today. Mixing data providers like this is not unprecedented. Maps uses dozens of data providers including Yelp, Foursquare, Garmin and Tripadvisor for different locales and data types.\nBut, of course, this change has an additional dimension of interest given the years-long saga of Google being default on Apple devices including the iPhone. Google has famously made a bunch of money from iOS because of default search and because its apps and services are popular. At times those figures appeared to even exceed the amount of money that Google had made from Android.\nOne question that I do not have the answer to is whether this change comes completely from Apple wanting consistent results or whether it is a condition of the ~$3B deal that Google has in place to remain the default search provider on Apple devices. Perhaps a blend of the two.\nThe changes began rolling out at 9am PT and should roll out to the entire world by this afternoon.\nUpdate: A Microsoft spokesperson provided the following comment when asked about the altered shape of Bing on iOS.\nWe value our relationship with Apple and look forward to continuing to partner with them in many ways, including on Bing Image Search in Siri, to provide the best experience possible for our customers. Bing has grown every year since its launch, now powering over a third of all the PC search volume in the U.S., and continues to grow worldwide. It also powers the search experiences of many other partners, including Yahoo (Verizon), AOL and Amazon, as well as the multi-lingual abilities of Twitter. As we move forward, given our work to advance the field of AI, we\u2019re confident that Bing will be at the forefront of providing a more intelligent search experience for our customers and partners.\nArticle updated to clarify that it\u2019s Spotlight on the Mac, not Safari and that only Siri image results are Bing.",

        "title": "Apple does right by users and advertisers are displeased | Electronic Frontier Foundation",
        "body": "With the new Safari 11 update, Apple takes an important step to protect your privacy, specifically how your browsing habits are tracked and shared with parties other than the sites you visit. In response, Apple is getting criticized by the advertising industry for \"destroying the Internet's economic model.\" While the advertising industry is trying to shift the conversation to what they call the economic model of the Internet, the conversation must instead focus on the indiscriminate tracking of users and the violation of their privacy.\nWhen you browse the web, you might think that your information only lives in the service you choose to visit. However, many sites load elements that share your data with third parties. First-party cookies are set by the domain you are visiting, allowing sites to recognize you from your previous visits but not to track you across other sites. For example, if you visit first examplemedia.com and then socialmedia.com, your visit would only be known to each site. In contrast, third-party cookies are those set by any other domains than the one you are visiting, and were created to circumvent the original design of cookies. In this case, when you would visit examplemedia.com and it loads tracker.socialmedia.com as well, socialmedia.com would be able to track you an all sites that you visit where its tracker is loaded.\nWebsites commonly use third-party tracking to allow analytics services, data brokerages, and advertising companies to set unique cookies. This data is aggregated into individual profiles and fed into a real-time auction process where companies get to bid for the right to serve an ad to a user when they visit a page. This mechanism can be used for general behavioral advertising but also for \u201cretargeting.\u201d In the latter case, the vendor of a product viewed on one site buys the chance to target the user later with ads for the same product on other sites around the web. As a user, you should be able to expect you will be treated with respect and that your personal browsing habits will be protected. When websites share your behavior without your knowledge, that trust is broken.\nSafari has been blocking third-party cookies by default since Safari 5.1, released in 2010, and has been key to Apple\u2019s emerging identity as a defender of user privacy. Safari distinguished between these seedy cookies from those placed on our machines by first parties - sites we visit intentionally. From 2011 onwards, advertising companies have been devising ways to circumvent these protections. One of the biggest retargeters, Criteo, even acquired a patent on a technique to subvert this protection . Criteo, however, was not the first company to circumvent Safari's user protection. In 2012, Google paid 22.5 million dollars to settle an action by the FTC after they used another workaround to track Safari users with cookies from the DoubleClick Ad Network. Safari had an exception to the third-party ban for submission forms where the user entered data deliberately (e.g. to sign up). Google exploited this loophole when Safari users visited sites participating in Google's advertising network to set a unique cookie.\nThe new Safari update, with Intelligent Tracking Prevention, closes loopholes around third-party cookie-blocking by using machine learning to distinguish the sites a user has a relationship with from those they don\u2019t, and treating the cookies differently based on that. When you visit a site, any cookies that are set can be used in a third-party context for twenty-four hours. During the first twenty-four hours the third-party cookies can be used to track the user, but afterward can only be used to login and not to track. This means that sites that you visit regularly are not significantly affected. The companies this will hit hardest are ad companies unconnected with any major publisher.\nAt EFF we understand the need for sites to build a successful business model, but this should not come at the expense of people's privacy. This is why we launched initiatives like the EFF DNT Policy and tools like Privacy Badger. These initiatives and tools target tracking, not advertising. Rather than attacking Apple for serving their users, the advertising industry should treat this as an opportunity to change direction and develop advertising models that respect (and not exploit) users.\nApple has been a powerful force in user privacy on a mass scale in recent years, as reflected by their support for encryption, the intelligent processing of user data on device rather than in the cloud, and limitations on ad tracking on mobile and desktop. By some estimates, Apple handles 30% of all pages on mobile. Safari's innovations are not the silver bullet that will stop all tracking, but by stepping up to protect their users\u2019 privacy Apple has set a challenge for other browser developers. When the user's privacy interests conflict with the business models of the advertising technology complex, is it possible to be neutral? We hope that Mozilla, Microsoft and Google will follow Apple, Brave and Opera's lead.",

        "title": "Apple Responds to Safari 11 Criticism From Advertising Groups: 'People Have a Right to Privacy'",
        "body": "Six trade and marketing organizations this morning published an open letter to Apple asking the company to \"rethink\" plans to launch new versions of Safari in iOS and macOS that block cross-site tracking, and this afternoon, Apple offered up a response, which was shared by The Loop.\nAccording to Apple, ad tracking companies are essentially able to recreate a person's web browsing history using cross site tracking techniques sans permission, something it's aiming to stop.\n\"Apple believes that people have a right to privacy - Safari was the first browser to block third party cookies by default and Intelligent Tracking Prevention is a more advanced method for protecting user privacy,\" Apple said in a statement provided to The Loop. \"Ad tracking technology has become so pervasive that it is possible for ad tracking companies to recreate the majority of a person's web browsing history. This information is collected without permission and is used for ad re-targeting, which is how ads follow people around the Internet. The new Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature detects and eliminates cookies and other data used for this cross-site tracking, which means it helps keep a person's browsing private. The feature does not block ads or interfere with legitimate tracking on the sites that people actually click on and visit. Cookies for sites that you interact with function as designed, and ads placed by web publishers will appear normally.\"\nIn the open letter, signed by the Data and Marketing Association and the Network Advertising Initiative, among others, the collective \"digital advertising community\" said it is \"deeply concerned\" because the update \"overrides and replaces existing user-controlled cookie preferences\" before going on to suggest that customers prefer targeted ads.\n\"Apple's unilateral and heavy-handed approach is bad for consumer choice and bad for the ad-supported online content and services consumers love,\" reads the letter. \"Blocking cookies in this manner will drive a wedge between brands and their customers, and it will make advertising more generic and less timely and useful.\"\nIn both macOS High Sierra and iOS 11, the Safari web browser is gaining new privacy features to prevent companies from tracking customer web browsing habits across websites. \"The success of the web as a platform relies on user trust,\" Apple says on the WebKit blog. \"Many users feel that trust is broken when they are being tracked and privacy-sensitive data about their web activity is acquired for purposes that they never agreed to.\"\nIn iOS 11, the toggle to turn off cross-site tracking is available by going to Settings --> Safari --> Prevent Cross-Site Tracking. With macOS High Sierra, the feature can be accessed by going to the Preferences section of the Safari app, choosing Privacy, and then checking \"Prevent Cross-Site Tracking.\"\niOS 11 will be released to the public next Tuesday, September 19, while macOS High Sierra will be released on the following Monday, September 25.",

        "body": "What Steve Jobs Taught Google\u2019s Tony Fadell About Designing Simple Products\nFlickr user TED Conference\nAt the TED conference in Vancouver this year, one of the main designers of the iPod and founder of Nest, Tony Fadell, gave a few simple tips about creating awesome products. While most of us won\u2019t be working on the next world-wide gadget phenomenon, his tips, especially those from the late great Steve Jobs, seemed delightfully practical for all sorts of projects.\nSince his time at Apple, Fadell has gone on to create the Nest thermostat and is now a lead designer at Google.\n1). \u201cStaying Beginner\u201d\nJobs insisted that his design team \u201cstay beginner\u201d: walk in the shoes of someone who has never experienced a product before. When a new Apple product came out, Fadell would wait in long lines at an Apple store, purchase it at the counter like everyone else, unbox it and try to get it working.\nThough he may have been involved in every aspect of the iPod, taking the trek of the consumer taught him to notice the little frustrations that can destroy an otherwise good idea.\nAs an example, he talked about shipping a product with a charged battery. Only a few years ago, it was all-to-common to unwrap a new MP3 player with the glee of christmas morning, only to find out we had to wait a few hours to charge the device.\nThis is a piss-poor first impression for a product. Now, Apple products, he says, come with at least a partially charged battery. The act of \u201cstaying beginner\u201d helps us see the frustrations that we otherwise resign ourselves to believing are fate.\n\u201cThe more we\u2019re exposed to something,\u201d Fadell said, \u201cthe more we get used to it\u201d.\nBreaking out of the mold by walking in a consumer\u2019s shoes gives a new perspective.\n2). Put Young People on the team\n\u201cIf you have those young minds, they cause everyone to think young,\u201d Fadell said. Young workers\u2019 na\u00efvet\u00e9, he argues, is an asset. They don\u2019t accept all the assumptions that we\u2019ve become habituated to making. Even if their suggestions are completely unrealistic, they force all of the older folks on the team to question unexpected assumptions.\nThe data seems to support this idea that young people can be extraordinary for innovation. This year, there were a record 46 billionaires under the age of 40 on Forbes famous list of the rich and famous, mostly from technology. Snapchat\u2019s Evan Spiegel, for instance, is a billionaire at just 24 years old.\nTechnology and the app economy has given young minds the ability to create products without permission \u2014 and, as a result, many have thrived.\nStaying beginner and staying young: two simple, practical ideas.",

In 2017, I use my pocket supercomputer of a phone to tweet with brands.\nBut Apple's iPhone X provides a nice little illustration of how sensor and processing technology has evolved in the past decade. In June 2009, Microsoft unveiled this:\nIn September 2017, Apple put all that tech in this:\nWell, minus the tilt motor.\nMicrosoft's original Kinect hardware was powered by a little-known Israeli company called PrimeSense. PrimeSense pioneered the technology of projecting a grid of infrared dots onto a scene, then detecting them with an IR camera and acsertaining depth information through a special processing chip.\nThe output of the Kinect was a 320 x 240 depth map with 2,048 levels of sensitivity (distinct depths), based on the 30,000-ish laser dots the IR projector blasted onto the scene in a proprietary speckle pattern.\nIn its day, the Kinect was the fastest selling consumer electronics device of all time, while it was also widely regarded as a flop for gaming. But the revolutionary depth-sensing tech ended up being a huge boost for robotics and machine vision.\nIn 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense. Depth cameras continued to evolve: Kinect 2.0 for the Xbox One replaced PrimeSense technology with Microsoft's own tech and had much higher accuracy and resolution. It could recognize faces and even detect a player's heart rate. Meanwhile, Intel also built its own depth sensor, Intel RealSense, and in 2015 worked with Microsoft to power Windows Hello. In 2016, Lenovo launched the Phab 2 Pro, the first phone to carry Google's Tango technology for augmented reality and machine vision, which is also based on infrared depth detection.\nAnd now, in late 2017, Apple is going to sell a phone with a front-facing depth camera. Unlike the original Kinect, which was built to track motion in a whole living room, the sensor is primarily designed for scanning faces and powers Apple\u2019s Face ID feature. Apple\u2019s \u201cTrueDepth\u201d camera blasts \u201cmore than 30,000 invisible dots\u201d and can create incredibly detailed scans of a human face. In fact, while Apple\u2019s Animoji feature is impressive, the developer API behind it is even wilder: Apple generates, in real time, a full animated 3D mesh of your face, while also approximating your face\u2019s lighting conditions to improve the realism of AR applications.",

His teams are responsible for delivering the software at the heart of Apple\u2019s innovative products, including the user interface, applications and frameworks.\nApple's leadership page is only now reflecting Federighi's role as head of Siri, but the transition has been apparent for several months, based on recent interviews and stage appearances at Apple's keynotes.\nAt WWDC 2016, for example, Federighi and Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller joined Daring Fireball's John Gruber to discuss how Apple was opening Siri up to third-party developers with SiriKit later that year.\nAt WWDC 2017, Federighi was on stage to discuss improvements to Siri in iOS 11, including more natural voice, built-in translation capabilities, and advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence.\nCue continues to oversee the iTunes Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, Apple Maps, iCloud, and the iWork and iLife suites of apps, and handing off Siri should allow him to focus more on Apple's push into original content.\nApple's updated leadership page also now lists profiles for recently promoted employees Deirdre O'Brien, Vice President of People, and Isabel Ge Mahe, Vice President and Managing Director of Greater China.",

        "title": "iOS 11 makes it harder for someone else to get data off your phone",
        "body": "If someone takes your iPhone, can they get your data too?\nFor years, Apple has been working to make sure the answer is no. The iPhone\u2019s local storage drive has strong encryption, and without a passcode or a fingerprint, there\u2019s no way to get past the lockscreen. If the phone powers down or goes 48 hours without a login, it locks down even further, requiring a passcode to restart. It\u2019s a huge problem for phone thieves \u2014 and, as the San Bernardino case demonstrated, makes life difficult for law enforcement too. It\u2019s still possible to get cloud data held on Apple servers, and any data controlled by an app is another story \u2014 but if it\u2019s stored locally on your phone, it\u2019s tough to get without your permission.\nWith those protections in place, thieves and digital forensics experts have turned to the iPhone\u2019s automatic backup system as the easiest way through. If your phone has registered your computer as a trusted device, it\u2019s possible to trigger an automatic backup from the computer itself, which basically dumps all the phone\u2019s data onto the computer in a nice package for investigators. Even if the computer isn\u2019t a trusted device, all you need to establish a trusted device is a fingerprint login, which you could potentially spoof or 3D-print. Once you\u2019ve made that login, you can pair the phone, dump the data, and start picking through.\nYou won\u2019t be able to establish a pair with just a fingerprint; you\u2019ll need the full passcode\nIn some ways, this sounds a lot like logging into the phone \u2014 but it gives a lot more access for a much longer span of time. Once a computer is registered as a trusted device for a particular phone, the computer can pull backups off that phone at any time in the future, even without logging in.\nThe process for establishing a trusted device is already a bit daunting \u2014 but with iOS 11, that system will get just a little bit tighter. A new post from ElcomSoft (which makes the forensic software that pulls data off those paired phones) details an overlooked feature in iOS 11 that will make that system a little bit harder to crack. Now, you won\u2019t be able to establish a pair with just a fingerprint; you\u2019ll need the full passcode, just as if you were unlocking the phone after a hard reset. It seems minor, but it\u2019s potentially a serious problem for police, who are legally allowed to compel fingerprints but move into trickier legal territory when it comes to passcodes.\nIn the abstract, this is all something of a moot point. If you\u2019re spoofing fingerprints, you\u2019ve got enough to log into the phone itself (as long as it\u2019s not locked down), at which point you can just open apps and get the data you need anyway. But backing up the phone to a trusted device is a huge part of modern forensics, and it\u2019s one of the few ways for investigators to be sure they\u2019ve gotten every piece of data they could. Under iOS 11, it will be harder to do that without the user\u2019s permission, turning up the heat ever so slightly on the encryption debate.",

        "body": "Apple's new Face ID facial recognition feature will work with most sunglasses, according to Apple software engineering chief Craig Federighi.\n\"Most sunglasses let through enough IR light that Face ID can see your eyes even when the glasses appear to be opaque. It's really amazing!\" Federighi said in an email to MacRumors reader and developer Keith Krimbel (@yokeremote and @keithkrimbel on Twitter) who emailed the Apple exec with a list of questions this morning.\nWhile Apple's Face ID coverage has specifically said the feature works with hats, scarves, beards, glasses, makeup, and other items that might obscure the face, sunglasses were not specifically mentioned. Federighi's answer clears up one of the last major unknowns about Face ID.\nKrimbel also asked for details on what would prevent a thief from taking the iPhone X, pointing it at his face, and running off. In response, Federighi says there are two mitigations in place. \"If you don't stare at the phone, it won't unlock,\" he wrote. \"Also, if you grip the buttons on both sides of the phone when [you] hand it over, it will temporarily disable Face ID.\"\nIn addition to answering these questions, Federighi also commented on the now highly-publicized on-stage Face ID gaffe that saw the feature fail to recognize his face. According to Apple, the software failed because someone else had picked up the phone ahead of Federighi's demo. Federighi says it's not really an issue he had encountered before.\nThe bio-lockout that I experienced on stage would require several interacts by other people with your phone (where they woke up the phone). For those of us who have been living on the iPhone X over the last months this has never been a real problem (hence my shock when it happened to me on stage! :-)\nThe Face ID facial recognition feature is designed to replace Touch ID as the new de facto biometric authentication system. While it's limited to the iPhone X at this time, Apple has said it is the future of how we will unlock our smartphones.\nFor more on how Face ID scans your face, whether it can be fooled, how it works with Apple Pay, and the built-in privacy features, make sure to check out our Face ID post that covers all of the ins and outs of the new feature.",

        "title": "iPhone X: Six core A11 Fusion chip, wireless charging hints, Apple Pay + Face ID details, more",
        "body": "Update: Steve Troughton Smith clarifies the processor information:\nJust to clarify on the A11: it's two high-power Monsoon cores and four low-power Mistral cores, all independently addressable. No Fusion \u2014 Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) September 10, 2017\nLeaks continue today from the iOS 11 GM. Yesterday, we told you about iPhone X details such as the Face ID setup process, and now a handful of more details have emerged related to wireless charging, camera improvements, and more\u2026\nWhile several reports have highlighted that the iPhone X will support wireless charging, the iOS 11 GM further corroborates that. Code strings show a few mentions of wireless charging in the ChargingViewService app. The strings here hint at some 3D animations that will show when the device is charging via wireless charging.\nPerhaps most notably, however, is that the code suggests that the new A11 Fusion chip is a six core processor. It appears as if Apple will pack four high performance, or \u201cMistral,\u201d cores and two battery life efficient \u201cMonsson\u201d cores.\nFor comparison\u2019s sake, the A10 Fusion processor in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus pack two high performance cores and two high-efficiency cores. Meanwhile, the A10X in the iPad Pro features a 3+3 setup. This means that the new iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X will be Apple\u2019s most powerful iOS device by wide margin. Of course, one important thing to note here is that performance partially will depend on the clock speed of the processors, but either way we\u2019re looking at a dramatic jump.\nAs far as the camera goes, the iOS 11 GM suggests that the iPhone 8 and iPhone X will support 4K video at 60 FPS, as well as 1080p video at 240 FPS. It was initially believed that these camera improvements would only apply to the flagship iPhone X, but the iOS 11 GM suggests it will come to both the iPhone 8 and iPhone X.\nFurthermore, it\u2019s now believed that the new Portrait Lighting features will be available on both the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. As we reported yesterday, Portrait Lighting features settings for things like Contour Light, Natural Light, Stage Light, Stage Light Mono, and Studio Light. This feature will likely be related to flash and lighting during Portrait Mode shots.\nThe iOS 11 GM also offers a bit more information about the side power button, which is believed to be much larger on the iPhone X than on previous devices. It appears as if the power button will be integral to the Apple Pay process as Face ID will passively authenticate the payment, but you\u2019ll have to double click the power button to confirm it.\nThe same code also hints that Face ID will come to the iPad at some point down the line. While this is likely a case of Apple future proofing the code, it\u2019s still notable as it\u2019s likely a look at what\u2019s to come with next year\u2019s iPad upgrades.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg\nChargingViewService confirms wireless charging.

        "title": "iPhone 8 Is World's Fastest Phone (It's Not Even Close)",
        "body": "Update 12/21: We've added results from the iPhone X.\nThe \"Bionic\" part in the name of Apple's A11 Bionic chip isn't just marketing speak. It's the most powerful processor ever put in a mobile phone. We've put this chip -- which powers the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X -- to the test in both synthetic benchmarks and some real-world speed trials, and it obliterates every Android phone we tested.\nAs a quick primer, the A11 Bionic is a six-core CPU, with two performance cores that promise a 25-percent boost in performance and four high-efficiency cores that promise up to a 70-percent improvement over the iPhone 7's A10 Fusion chip. Last but not least is an Apple-designed GPU that's supposed to be 30 percent faster than before.\nLet's start with Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance. On the multicore portion of this test, the iPhone 8 hit 10,170. That's 54 percent faster than the score from Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 \u2014 currently the fastest Android phone. The iPhone X scored 10,357 on the same test.\nThe Android competition wasn't close. The Note 8 scored 6,564, and that's with an impressive 6GB of RAM paired with Qualcomm's fast Snapdragon 835 chip. How about the OnePlus 5 and its 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 835? That handset got 6,542. With 4GB of RAM, the Galaxy S8 scored 6,295 with the same processor.\nThe iPhone 8 even edged out the score from the 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro with a 7th-generation Core i5 processor. That notebook notched 9,213. Is Geekbench 4 really comparable from phone to desktop? According to the founder of Geekbench, John Poole, \u201cthe short is answer is yes that the scores are comparable across platforms, so if an iPhone 8 scores higher than an i5, then the iPhone 8 is faster than the i5.\u201d\nMORE: iPhone 8 Plus vs. Galaxy Note 8 Camera Face-Off - Why Apple Wins\nHowever, Poole provided the important caveat that laptops are better at delivering sustained performance over a longer period of time, as opposed to the shorter max burst performance that benchmarks like Geekbench 4 are designed to measure. In other words, the iPhone 8 simply doesn\u2019t have the thermals and heat dissipation necessary to replace your laptop.\nNext up is 3DMark, which gauges graphics performance. The iPhone 8 scored an off-the-charts 62,212, and the iPhone 8 Plus managed an even higher 64,412. Compare that to the Note 8's 39,834 and the OnePlus 5's 39,576.\nIf you're wondering how all this translates to real-world performance, we have more good news for iPhone 8 shoppers \u2014 and bad news for everyone else. To really put the A11 Bionic chip through its paces, we put the same 2-minute video, shot in 4K by a drone, on the iPhone 8, Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S8+, and then added the same transitions and effects before exporting and saving the video.\nThe iPhone 8 and iPhone X finished this strenuous task in just 42 seconds, while the Note 8 took more than 3 minutes. The Galaxy S8+ took more than 4 minutes.\nHow about opening a large file? We downloaded a 5.1 MB map illustration PDF to both the iPhone 8 and Galaxy Note 8 and opened them from their native file managers: the Apple Files app and the My Files app. The iPhone 8 averaged under 0.8 seconds, while the Note 8 averaged 6.41 seconds.\nThe iPhone 8 also opened more demanding apps faster than its predecessor and the top Android phone right now, although those differences were less dramatic. It took the iPhone 8 11 seconds to fully load the Injustice 2 game, compared to 14.53 seconds for the iPhone 7 Plus and 19 seconds for the Note 8.\nOf course, there are lots of ways to measure performance, but based on our testing thus far, the iPhone 8 is easily the fastest phone ever. Now everyone else has to play catchup.\nIllustration: Tom's Guide/Shutterstock",

        "body": "Tim Cook was among the top tech leaders who sat down with Trump ahead of inauguration in hopes of helping shape the new president\u2019s tech policy. But like many of those who held a glimmer of hope for some post-election softening of campaign rhetoric, Apple\u2019s CEO has found more than a few reasons to push back. In the wake of the violence in Charlottesville last month that ended in three deaths, Cook issued a statement highlighting his disagreement with Trump\u2019s response.\nCook took to Twitter this morning, to expand on his support the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) following news that Trump could end the program next week. Signed by President Obama in 2012, the \u201cDreamers\u201d program protects undocumented young immigrants from threat of deportation. In his tweet, Cook explained that the company currently employs 250 Dreamers.\n250 of my Apple coworkers are #Dreamers. I stand with them. They deserve our respect as equals and a solution rooted in American values. \u2014 Tim Cook (@tim_cook) September 3, 2017\nTrump told the press this week that he\u2019s been considering ending the program, with a press secretary adding that a decision would be announced on Tuesday of next week, just after the Labor Day holiday. The move would be an extension of the promises that fueled the President\u2019s campaign from the outset, including including the kick-off event in which, he told the crowd that Mexico is \u201cbringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d\nNews that Trump was strongly considering ending the program prompted Cook, along with the heads of Amazon, Google, Netflix and other key tech companies to pen a letter this week asking Trump to continue DACA. \u201cDreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our economy,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cWith them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage.\u201d\nThe letter noted the \u201c780,000 hardworking young people\u201d that would risk deportation, should DACA come to an end. With today\u2019s tweet, Cook explained that the program is more than just abstract politics for the company. Ending it on Tuesday would have a tangible impact on Apple, along with the rest of the reported 72 percent of Fortune 500 companies that currently employ Dreamers.\nThe potential repeal has proven controversial even with leaders of Trump\u2019s own party. On Friday, House Speaker Paul Ryan expressed concern about the move, telling reporters, \u201cI actually don\u2019t think he should do that. I believe that this is something that Congress has to fix.\u201d",

        "body": "Apple isn't expected to catch up to iPhone X demand before first half of 2018\nArticle Hero Image\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nApple is poised to be able to ship about 40 million iPhone X units before the end of 2017, which won't be nearly enough to meet consumer demand for the redesigned handset with edge-to-edge OLED display, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nKuo, of KGI Securities, issued a note to investors on Friday, a copy of which was obtained by AppleInsider, offering positive reactions to the iPhone X unveiling earlier this week. Specifically, he believes that Apples facial recognition technology will set it apart from competitors, and the full-screen design and augmented reality advantages with iPhone X will further drive sales.\nIt's really just a question of how quickly Apple will be able to produce the iPhone X, as Kuo believes Apple won't be able to meet market demand before the first half of 2018.\nFurther, while he previously thought Apple might be able to build as many as 50 million iPhone X units before the end of this year, he has slashed that number down to about 40 million.\nAny handsets Apple is unable to build this year just translate to sales next year, however. Accordingly, Kuo has increased his 2018 shipment estimates to between 80 million and 90 million iPhone X units.\nRegarding Face ID, Kuo believes Apple's proprietary structured light technology will be able to provide a level of security that is consistent and acceptable. And he also said that users will be delighted with facial recognition capabilities integrated into new features like Animoji.\nHe also said that the iPhone X has the highest screen-to-body ratio on the market, which could make it the most appealing edge-to-edge handset available to consumers.\nAnd Apple's ARKit and new cameras and sensors on the iPhone X give it a significant lead in AR, marrying software and hardware integration into an experience that will be difficult for competitors to replicate.\nKuo cautioned that some investors may be concerned about market acceptance of both Face ID and the $999 starting price of the iPhone X. He doesn't share those same concerns looking longterm, however.\n\"Amid mixed market views, we expect shares of the Apple supply chain to be volatile or even corrected in the near future,\" he wrote. \"We recommend investors seize the opportunity to accumulate supply chain shares.\"\nBottlenecks for Apple and production of the iPhone X are said to include the new OLED edge-to-edge display, as well as the advanced front facing camera array that enables Face ID. Previously, Kuo indicated that Apple's current production levels of the iPhone X are limited to less than 10,000 units per day.",

Earlier this month, estimates improved to one to two weeks, before hitting three to five business days today.\nDuring Apple's third quarter earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Apple had boosted AirPods production capacity and was \"working very hard\" to get AirPods to customers as quickly as possible.\nOccasionally, Apple retail stores have received stock and third-party retailers like Best Buy have been able to offer AirPods with faster shipping on a regular basis, but those stocks have usually run out fast.\nCosting $159, Apple's \"truly wireless\" AirPods have gained popularity due to their long battery life, capacious charge case, infrared sensors that detect when they're being worn, touch-based gestures, and a built-in W1 chip that improves Bluetooth connection.
