        "body": "The San Bernardino Case\nWe were shocked and outraged by the deadly act of terrorism in San Bernardino last December. We mourn the loss of life and want justice for all those whose lives were affected. The FBI asked us for help in the days following the attack, and we have worked hard to support the government\u2019s efforts to solve this horrible crime. We have no sympathy for terrorists.\nWhen the FBI has requested data that\u2019s in our possession, we have provided it. Apple complies with valid subpoenas and search warrants, as we have in the San Bernardino case. We have also made Apple engineers available to advise the FBI, and we\u2019ve offered our best ideas on a number of investigative options at their disposal.\nWe have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.\nSpecifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software \u2014 which does not exist today \u2014 would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone\u2019s physical possession.\nThe FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.",

        "title": "Apple proven right: WSJ reports \"about a dozen\" other iPhone unlock requests from government",
        "body": "In addition to the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters, the US government is pursuing court orders to force Apple to help bypass the security passcodes of \"about a dozen\" other iPhones, the Wall Street Journal reports. The other cases don't involve terror charges, the Journal's sources say, but prosecutors involved have also sought to use the same 220-year-old law \u2014 the All Writs Act of 1789 \u2014 to access the phones in question.\nThe FBI has argued that it only wants Apple to allow it to \"guess\" the passcode for the San Bernardino iPhone, but that innocuous-sounding process involves Apple performing a rewrite of the phone's iOS software, allowing the Bureau to use brute-force techniques to crack the passcode that might otherwise take years. The agency says it only wants this process performed on this one specific iPhone, but privacy advocates could see the additional cases as the US government already attempting to overreach this mandate.\nIt's not clear yet what the other cases involve\nAt this point, however, it's not clear what the dozen-or-so cases actually entail, nor what prosecutors are asking Apple to do exactly, or why Apple is pushing back. The FBI has complained that Apple is simply resisting its demand to unlock the phone so as not to \"tarnish the Apple brand,\" but the company says if it gives in and allows the FBI to access the phone with \"absent clear legal authority to do so,\" it would breach its consumers' trust.",

        "title": "Uninstalling Facebook app saves up to 15% of iPhone battery life",
        "body": "Facebook is one of the most downloaded apps on iOS but it has long been cited as a cause of fast-draining iPhone batteries. Last year it was accused of using background tricks to stay active even when it wasn\u2019t being used. Facebook admitted bugs existed, and fixed them, but questions of the app\u2019s impact on battery life remained.\nSimilar concerns about Facebook\u2019s Android app led to the discovery that deleting the app saves up to 20% of a phone\u2019s battery. After that revelation, I set about seeing if the same was true for iPhone users. I discovered that uninstalling Facebook\u2019s iOS app and switching to Safari can save up to 15% of iPhone battery life.\nAn alternative to uninstalling Facebook is using the hump from Apple\u2019s Smart Battery case\nUsing an iPhone 6S Plus for a week without the main Facebook app installed, I recorded the battery life at 10.30pm each day for a week comparing it to a daily average taken from a week with the app. I charged the phone overnight, taking it off the charger at 7.30am, and used it normally. I accessed Facebook for the same amount of time, and for the same purposes, using the social network\u2019s excellent mobile site within Safari, as I had done using the app. I also left the Facebook Messenger app installed.\nOn average I had 15% more battery left by 10.30pm each day. I had also saved space, because at the point I had deleted the Facebook app it had consumed around 500MB in total combining the 111MB of the app itself and its cache on the iPhone.\nTo make sure that this wasn\u2019t an isolated incident, I also recruited several other Facebook-using iPhone owners to conduct a similar test. They all found similar results, with increased battery life when using Facebook in Safari having uninstalled the main Facebook iOS app.\nSpot the difference: one is the Facebook app, the other the Facebook mobile site. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\nUsing Facebook in Safari was almost as good as the app. You can even place a shortcut to Facebook in Safari on the homescreen that looks almost identical to the app\u2019s icon (the white is a little less bright but you need eagle eyes to see). The only restriction was the Share-to function, which does not exist for websites, meaning that to share photos I had to manually hit the \u201cpost photos\u201d button on the mobile site.\nFeatures of the app, such as Instant Articles, are also not available. Tapping a link on the Facebook mobile site opens a new Safari tab.\nThe results will vary for the smaller iPhone 6S, as it has a smaller battery and shorter battery life overall, but judging by the 6S Plus experience, removing the Facebook app in preference of using the social network in Safari will extend the battery life of any iPhone.\nA Facebook spokesperson said the company was investigating the matter.",

It\u2019s Friday afternoon so presidential candidate Donald Trump has called for a boycott on all Apple products. His announcement follows this week\u2019s FBI request that Apple help it unlock the San Bernardino gunman\u2019s iPhone, which Tim Cook says would set a dangerous precedent.\nHere\u2019s the kicker: As news broke that Trump was calling for a boycott on Apple until it cooperates with the FBI, Donald Trump (or whoever manages his Twitter account) was tweeting a series of unrelated messages \u2026 from Twitter for iPhone.\nWe\u2019ll keep an eye on Apple\u2019s stock and see how this boycott request goes. In the meantime, best comment goes to chrisl84 with \u201cMake encryption average again\u201d.\nAs for Mr. Trump, my understanding is that these tweets from iPhone were sent while the presidential candidate was on stage at an event.

        "body": "NY judge rules feds can't force Apple to unlock an iPhone Case in New York adds a new twist to the ongoing legal battle.\nA US magistrate judge in New York has ruled that the government can't force Apple to help law enforcement unlock an iPhone using the All Writs Act. This case in question is about drug trafficking and is not related to the San Bernardino shooter case\nWhile the cases are different, it's a win for Apple in its battle with the FBI and Department of Justice. An Apple senior executive told Engadget that while it's a important precedent, it's not a binding precedent that magistrate Judge Pym in the San Bernardino case is legally bound to follow.\nIn his order magistrate Judge James Orenstein states: \"More specifically, the established rules for interpreting a statute's text constrain me to reject the government's interpretation that the AWA empowers a court to grant any relief not outright prohibited by law.\"\nApple has earlier prodded Judge Orenstein to rule on the feds wanting Apple to help it unlock the phone of Jun Feng who was suspected of conspiracy to traffic methamphetamine. During a search, DEA agents seized an iPhone 5s belonging to Feng.\nThe government then initiated the execution of a search warrant for the contents of the phone which has a passcode. Apple then submitted an opposition to the order and after additional filings and oral arguments, we're here. Another case with a locked iPhone that the government want's Apple to help unlock and the company rejecting that order. Only in this case, a judge has already ruled and its in Apple's favor.\nSubscribe to the Engadget Deals Newsletter Great deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget\u2019s editorial team.

If the government wants to use All Writs or CALEA to force companies to circumvent encryption, there needs to a clear law granting it that power.\nOne interesting bit of information to come out of today's news is that during a conference call with reporters, an Apple senior executive insisted that Apple has never created or signed any piece of software to decrypt a phone.\nThe company has handed iCloud backups over to law enforcement when order by the courts. This is in line with the company's remarks that if it has the data, it will comply with lawful orders.\nApple and Department of Justice will argue their cases in front of Judge Pym on March 22.",

        "body": "Apple's attorney painted a scary picture if Apple loses its fight with the FBI.\nIn an interview with CNNMoney's Laurie Segall on Friday, Ted Olson warned of a government with \"limitless\" powers that could \"listen to your conversations.\"\nOlson said the demands would mount.\n\"You can imagine every different law enforcement official telling Apple we want a new product to get into something,\" Olson said. \"Even a state judge could order Apple to build something. There's no stopping point. That would lead to a police state.\"\nThe government is trying to force Apple to create new software allowing the FBI to break through the passcode of an iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter. A magistrate Judge initially ruled in the government's favor, but a final hearing will be held on March 22.\nApple (AAPL) says the software will create a back door that will potentially allow anyone to break into millions of iPhones around the world.\n\"Apple is being asked to put an Achilles heel on the iPhone,\" Olson said. \"The iPhone's security is the reason why many, many people bought the phone.\"\nRelated: Apple tells court that the government can't force it to write code\nOlson said that Apple is \"very sensitive\" to national security and efforts by law enforcement to protect American citizens. He said that Apple has complied with every \"legal\" request by law enforcement for customers' data.\nBut in the case against the FBI, Olson said the government overstepped its legal authority. He said Apple's stance hasn't changed -- instead, it's the government's request that has changed and become more expansive than ever.\n\"It's very easy to say 'terrorism is involved' and therefore you should do whatever the government wants to do,\" he said. \"But just because you're using the word 'terrorism,' you don't want to violate the civil liberties that all of us cherish.\"\nThough he declined to say how far Apple plans to go in its court battle -- \"we are a long, long way from that\" -- he said that this is the kind of precedent-setting case that could go to the Supreme Court.\nIf the Supreme Court rules against Apple, though, he said Apple would go along with the ruling.\nMeanwhile, Olson noted that Apple continues to upgrade the security of its iPhones. CNNMoney has reported that Apple is working on developing an iPhone that even it can't break into.\n\"Apple is constantly trying to improve its iPhones ... so that people can't hack in and find out where your children are or what your medical records are,\" he said. \"So if Apple continues to do that, it's just a point at which the government just can't get into your soul. We have got to have a stopping point.\"\n- Erica Fink contributed reporting to this story.",

        "body": "Why is Apple objecting to the government\u2019s order?\nThe government asked a court to order Apple to create a unique version of iOS that would bypass security protections on the iPhone Lock screen. It would also add a completely new capability so that passcode tries could be entered electronically.\nThis has two important and dangerous implications:\nFirst, the government would have us write an entirely new operating system for their use. They are asking Apple to remove security features and add a new ability to the operating system to attack iPhone encryption, allowing a passcode to be input electronically. This would make it easier to unlock an iPhone by \u201cbrute force,\u201d trying thousands or millions of combinations with the speed of a modern computer.\nWe built strong security into the iPhone because people carry so much personal information on our phones today, and there are new data breaches every week affecting individuals, companies and governments. The passcode lock and requirement for manual entry of the passcode are at the heart of the safeguards we have built in to iOS. It would be wrong to intentionally weaken our products with a government-ordered backdoor. If we lose control of our data, we put both our privacy and our safety at risk.\nSecond, the order would set a legal precedent that would expand the powers of the government and we simply don\u2019t know where that would lead us. Should the government be allowed to order us to create other capabilities for surveillance purposes, such as recording conversations or location tracking? This would set a very dangerous precedent.",

The software would allow authorities to retrieve personal banking passwords, photos and other information.\nApple CEO Tim Cook has argued that such software could be used in the future and would create a dangerous precedent for cell phone evidence in court cases.\n\u201cThe government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that\u2019s simply not true,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cOnce created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.\u201d\nMs. Adams said such software could undermine the Constitution.\n\u201cThis is what separates us from communism, isn\u2019t it? The fact we have the right to privacy,\u201d she told the New York Post. \u201cI think Apple is definitely within their rights to protect the privacy of all Americans.\n\u201cThis is what makes America great to begin with, that we abide by a Constitution that gives us the right of privacy, the right to bear arms, and the right to vote.\u201d\nFederal authorities want to hack into Farook\u2019s phone to retrace the Islamic State sympathizer\u2019s steps on Dec. 2 when he and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, shot and killed 14 people at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino.\nCalifornia US Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym has ordered Apple to create a back door for the FBI to bypass an iPhone feature that destroys data after 10 consecutive unsuccessful unlock attempts.\n\u2022 Kellan Howell can be reached at khowell@washingtontimes.com.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nApple did \"exactly the right thing\" by refusing a request from the U.S. government to create a backdoor to access a terrorist's locked iPhone, billionaire Mark Cuban wrote in response to the encryption controversy this week.\n\"Amen. A standing ovation,\" Cuban wrote on his personal blog, heaping praise upon Apple and its chief executive, Tim Cook, for refusing to comply with the FBI's order. In his view, if Apple were to comply, it would open the doors for countless situations in the future where the government could point to this case as a precedent.\n\"We must stand up for our rights to free speech and liberty.\" - Mark Cuban\n\"Every tool that protects our privacy and liberties against oppression, tyranny, madmen and worse can often be used to take those very precious rights from us,\" Cuban said. \"But like we protect our 2nd Amendment Right, we must not let some of the negatives stand in the way of the positives. We must stand up for our rights to free speech and liberty.\"\nCuban believes American citizens should begin pushing their representatives to pass a law that limits the circumstances under which companies can be compelled to help the government break into a device. He proposed a series of four points that would justify such an instance:\nThat the incident in question be declared an Act of Terrorism, with casualties\nThat there is reason to believe the device was possessed by a participant in the incident\nThe device must have been on location for the incident\nThe terrorist who owned the device must be deceased\nCuban admitted that the subject is \"not an easy topic,\" but he believes an open discussion should be had for America to decide how to protect its citizens while also protecting personal liberties and security.\nThe open letter from Cuban joins a number of other high-profile names who have sided with Apple in its opposition to the government. Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft have also expressed support for Apple.\nThe controversy began Tuesday, when a U.S. magistrate judge ordered Apple to comply with FBI requests to help extract data from an iPhone owned by one of the shooters involved in the December terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. The device in question is an iPhone 5c that was password protected by the gunman, and is set to erase a stored decryption key after ten unsuccessful login attempts.\nApple Chief Executive Tim Cook responded with his own letter on Wednesday, saying that the creation of a backdoor tool to access a locked iPhone could open the flood gates for future issues, rippling well beyond the investigation into the San Bernardino shooting. The terrorist attack resulted in 16 deaths and 24 injuries.",

If the Federal Bureau of Investigation wanted to get into a phone in the future, it would need a new way to do so. That would most likely prompt a new cycle of court fights and, yet again, more technical fixes by Apple.\nThe only way out of this scenario, experts say, is for Congress to get involved. Federal wiretapping laws require traditional phone carriers to make their data accessible to law enforcement agencies. But tech companies like Apple and Google are not covered, and they have strongly resisted legislation that would place similar requirements on them.\n\u201cWe are in for an arms race unless and until Congress decides to clarify who has what obligations in situations like this,\u201d said Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.",

        "body": "Earlier this month, a Guardian report flagged a curious \u2018Error 53\u2019 message that was disabling iPhones. The error was caused by unofficial repair shops replacing the connector that ran between the Touch ID sensor in an iPhone\u2019s home button \u2014 usually in the process of replacing faulty home button assemblies.\nToday, Apple is issuing an updated version of iOS 9.2.1 for users that update their iPhones via iTunes only. This update will restore phones \u2018bricked\u2019 or disabled by Error 53 and will prevent future iPhones that have had their home button (or the cable) replaced by third-party repair centers from being disabled. Note that this is a patched version of iOS 9.2.1, previously issued, not a brand-new version of iOS.\nUpdate: A new support document on Apple\u2019s site has been issued that details the causes and repair methods for Error 53.\nThe update is not for users who update their iPhones over the air (OTA) via iCloud. If you update your phone that way, you should never have encountered Error 53 in the first place. If, however, you update via iTunes or your phone is bricked, you should be able to plug it into iTunes to get the update today, restoring your phone\u2019s functionality.\nApple issued the following statement to TechCrunch.\nSome customers\u2019 devices are showing \u2018Connect to iTunes\u2019 after attempting an iOS update or a restore from iTunes on a Mac or PC. This reports as an Error 53 in iTunes and appears when a device fails a security test. This test was designed to check whether Touch ID works properly before the device leaves the factory. Today, Apple released a software update that allows customers who have encountered this error message to successfully restore their device using iTunes on a Mac or PC. We apologize for any inconvenience, this was designed to be a factory test and was not intended to affect customers. Customers who paid for an out-of-warranty replacement of their device based on this issue should contact AppleCare about a reimbursement.\nApple is currently facing a class action lawsuit over the Error 53 matter. The quick fix could help to mitigate some of the suit\u2019s claims.\nNote, that the update will NOT re-enable Touch ID. As we wrote when we covered this issue previously, this is the right thing to do.\n\u201c\u2026your fingerprints are stored on a secure enclave. The secure enclave is a coprocessor that utilizes a secure boot process to make sure that it\u2019s uncompromised. It has a secret unique ID not accessible by the rest of the phone or Apple \u2014 it\u2019s like a private key. The phone generates ephemeral keys (think public keys) to talk with the Secure Enclave. They only work with the unique ID to encrypt and decrypt the data on the coprocessor.\u201d\nAllowing a third-party Touch ID sensor to function properly without an official Apple repair center both verifying that it is legitimate and recalibrating the cable to work with your iPhone\u2019s Secure Enclave is a huge security risk. A malicious repair shop or corrupted part could allow unauthorized access to your phone or its data. Apple is absolutely right to disable TouchID \u2014 it was also wrong for it to disable your entire iPhone for getting your home button replaced on the cheap.\nIf you want to retain Touch ID functionality, you can get your home button replaced by Apple. If cost is a concern (and you don\u2019t mind losing Touch ID) you can still get it done elsewhere without fear of bricking your phone.\nArticle updated to include mention of class action lawsuit.",

        "title": "Walt Mossberg on the decreasing quality of Apple's native apps",
        "body": "Welcome to Mossberg , a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Re/code by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Re/code.\nIn response to my inquiries about this, Apple said: \"We have dedicated software teams across multiple platforms. The effort is as strong there as it has ever been.\" The company explains that these teams work on every major core app each year, but, as with its hardware, some years see more major revamps of some apps than others.\nApple's own apps often fail to meet its self-imposed standards\nApple has, of course, had a few famous software misfires, like the MobileMe and iTunes Ping cloud services, and the first iterations of Apple Maps (which has gotten vastly better). And, so far, Apple News is nothing to write home about, in my view.\nBut I\u2019m talking about more familiar mainstays, like Mail and Photos, iTunes, and iCloud. In ways big and sometimes just small and nagging, I think they too often fail to meet Apple\u2019s self-imposed standards. Sometimes this is on iOS, sometimes on OS X, sometimes on both.\nHere are a few examples.\niTunes for the desktop\nApple\u2019s iTunes program was once the envy of the world. A combined digital music store and player, it could also sync your iPod. And it worked on both Mac and Windows. It was reasonably fast and very sure-footed.\nNow, I dread opening the thing.\nDespite a big overhaul in 2012 that made it better for a while, iTunes is once again bloated, complex, and sluggish. That has gotten even worse since the recent integration of the new Apple Music streaming service. Just the other day, I tried to sync two iPads to it (a rare event) and it took forever for the program to recognize them. On my three Macs, which were built from 2013\u20132015, iTunes is just too slow at almost every task.\nI dread opening iTunes\nIt\u2019s time to disassemble the thing, the way Apple has done on iOS, where iTunes is just a store and each content type, such as music, videos, and podcasts, has its own playback app.\nThe company concedes that it has debated this question, but, so far, has come down on the side of keeping the huge program in one piece and working to make it faster and wring out any bugs that occur.\nMail\nApple\u2019s desktop and mobile mail apps were once superb, but, despite some nice feature additions, I find they\u2019ve become slow and unreliable. This is especially true if you use Gmail, as a billion people now do. In my experience, on both platforms, Mail is slow at both receiving and sending Gmail messages, whether they are from personal or business accounts. Some messages don\u2019t show up. Search misses things.\nThe problem goes beyond Gmail\nLike many others I know who rely on Gmail, I\u2019ve been forced to switch to, or at least add, Google\u2019s Gmail app or website. Apple claims this is an issue beyond its control, or the control of any other email app vendor, because Gmail uses nonstandard technology that gives a speed advantage to the search giant\u2019s own apps and sites. (Google has told me otherwise in the past.)\nBut the problem goes beyond Gmail. You can find lots of other iOS and some new OS X email apps that try and help you do quick message triage, intelligently auto-sort various types of email, and more. Apple hasn\u2019t ventured into that territory, beyond enabling swiping actions for dealing with messages. Even its junk mail filters, once far superior to competitors\u2019, are failing on me regularly these days.\nAnd the mobile version of Mail still can\u2019t send mail to the contact groups you can make in Apple\u2019s own contacts app. (The company says this is deliberate, that groups on the iPhone weren\u2019t meant for use with Mail.)",

        "title": "Apple Hires Developer Behind Signal, Edward Snowden\u2019s Favorite Secure Chat App",
        "body": "Apple hires plenty of interns all year round, but one particular addition revealed this week caught the eye given the company\u2019s current position opposing a controversial order to enable the FBI to access the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.\nFrederic Jacobs, a Switzerland-based developer who worked to develop secure messaging app Signal \u2014 the communications app of choice for NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden \u2014 announced today that he is joining the Cupertino-based company this summer to work on its CoreOS security team. Jacobs spent two-and-a-half years with Whisper Systems, the company behind Signal, before leaving earlier this year.\nI'm delighted to announce that I accepted an offer to be working with the CoreOS security team at Apple this summer. \u2014 Frederic Jacobs (@FredericJacobs) February 25, 2016\nSignal has been praised by the cybersecurity community for its robustness. Snowden, for one, said he uses it daily. It was one of the few apps to receive top marks for security in an EFF survey, while Jonathan \u0179dziarski, a security researcher who has been much cited in Apple\u2019s battle with the FBI, praised it for revealing \u201cvirtually nothing\u201d when put through its paces with data excavation tools.\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what Jacobs\u2019 role will be at Apple, but his hiring comes at a time when the firm is under major pressure. Apple increases the security measures within iOS with every major software release, but yesterday news broke that the company is working to remove the current passcode-free recovery option from future iPhones, while it wants to begin encrypting iPhone backups on iCloud.\nWhy make these moves? The company has been ordered to create software to allow the FBI to access data stored on the iPhone but \u2014 were these new changes implemented \u2014 it would be unable to do that. In effect, the company has identified itself as a potential weak point in the security process because the FBI can compel it to provide data, thus, removing its ability to do that, mitigates that risk. Or at least it forces the FBI to find new ways to get inside devices.\nAs regards the current situation, Apple and the FBI have voiced very different opinions on the order.\nFBI Director James Comey this past weekend denied wanting to create a backdoor to all iPhones.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to break anyone\u2019s encryption or set a master key loose on the land. I hope thoughtful people will take the time to understand that,\u201d Comey wrote in an editorial.\nApple CEO Tim Cook focused on the long-term implications that such a move might have. Cook called the FBI\u2019s strategy \u201cchilling\u201d and, in an interview with ABC yesterday, he went so far as to describe the software that Apple has been ordered to create as being the \u201cequivalent of cancer\u201d which would compromise the security and safety of all Apple customers.\n\u201c[A] master key to turn 100 million locks, even if in the possession of a person you trust, could be stolen,\u201d the Apple CEO explained. \u201cYou can imagine the target on that piece. I\u2019m not saying [that] the government would abuse it, but there are lots of bad guys in the world. Millions of people have [already] had their personal information stolen by hackers.\u201d",

        "body": "The iPad Pro may be following in the footsteps of the Surface tablets \u2014 with its detachable keyboard, big screen and digital pen \u2014 but Apple\u2019s new high-end device came out ahead of Microsoft\u2019s first-party tablets in the key holiday quarter, according to new estimates released this morning by the IDC market research firm.\nReleased in November, the iPad Pro sold more than 2 million units in the fourth quarter, while Microsoft sold about 1.6 million Surface devices, most of them the high-end Surface Pro and not the entry-level Surface 3 device, said Jean Philippe Bouchard, IDC\u2019s research director for tablets, in a news release this morning. The research firm said the iPad Pro was the top-selling tablet in the category known as detachables.\n\u201cWith these results, it\u2019s clear that price is not the most important feature considered when acquiring a detachable \u2013 performance is,\u201d Bouchard said.\nLast week, Microsoft said its Surface lineup reached a new peak of more than $1.37 billion in revenue in the December quarter, a 22 percent increase from the same quarter last year. That included the Surface Pro 4 tablet and also the Surface Book, the Redmond company\u2019s first notebook computer, which wasn\u2019t included in the tablet numbers released by IDC this morning.\nOverall, Apple was the top tablet vendor for the fourth quarter, with 16.1 million units shipped, although that represented a decline of nearly 25 percent. Apple\u2019s result compared with 9.0 million units shipped by Samsung during the quarter, which was a decline of more than 18 percent.\nAmazon came in at #3 in the tablet market for the quarter, thanks to its budget Fire tablet, but IDC says it doesn\u2019t expect the company to hold that position.",

        "title": "OPINION: FBI fight with Apple is a big farce to get inside your phone",
        "body": "Earlier this week, the U.S. government dropped a bombshell in its ongoing crusade against strong encryption: A court order demanding that Apple help the Federal Bureau of Investigation bypass the security features of an iPhone recovered from Syed Rizwan Farook, who, along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people last December during a mass-shooting in San Bernardino, California.\nNational Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden called it the \u201cthe most important tech case in a decade,\u201d and in many ways he\u2019s absolutely right. Apple has been on the front lines of the tech privacy fight ever since it improved the security of its devices such that no one, not even the company itself, would be technically capable of accessing their stored data. Now, facing a standstill in Congress, the U.S. government has ordered the company to build a custom version of the iOS operating system that would disable the iPhone\u2019s security features, allowing FBI investigators to crack the passcode protecting the device by trying every possible combination \u2014 a method known as \u201cbrute force.\u201d\nThe order is unprecedented. At stake is whether the U.S. government can legally compel a company to create software that sabotages its own products in the name of fighting crime. In a scathing letter posted on Apple\u2019s website, CEO Tim Cook announced the company\u2019s intent to fight the order, saying it would set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d that would be ineffective against criminals and \u201cwould hurt only the well-meaning and law-abiding citizens who rely on companies like Apple to protect their data.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, many details of the case cast doubt on the value or existence of data supposedly contained on the device. It suggests the government\u2019s real goal is actually setting this dangerous precedent \u2014 not unlocking a dead criminal\u2019s phone.\nEvidence of this strategy can be found in the order itself \u2014 including in its legal justification, the All Writs Act, a law that was enacted 277 years ago. The Act broadly allows courts to compel individuals and companies to do pretty much anything, as long as it aids the execution of a court order and isn\u2019t unreasonably burdensome. Needless to say, its invocation in a case dealing with advanced technology is bizarre and smacks of desperation to many legal scholars. As the CATO Institute\u2019s privacy law expert Julian Sanchez puts it, \u201cThe FBI [...] is relying on an 18th-century law to grant it powers that our 21st Congress won\u2019t.\u201d\nSecondly, the FBI\u2019s assertion that the phone contains valuable evidence is at odds with the known facts of the case. The court order notes that Farook destroyed several other phones to hide evidence prior to the attack. It\u2019s extremely doubtful he\u2019d neglect to destroy the remaining phone if it had any evidence on it. Another reason to be skeptical: The device was actually owned by Farook\u2019s employer, the San Bernardino county health department. Given the lengths he went to destroy evidence, it\u2019s highly unlikely Farook would plan attacks using a company device, since it would be reasonable to assume his employer might be monitoring it. The phone was discovered by agents with the \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d feature turned on \u2014 a very strange setting to have activated on a device being used to coordinate terrorist plots.",

        "body": "Apple currently plans to use its next major release of the Mac operating system, known as OS X 10.12, this fall to continue to expand Siri across its product lines. Last year, Apple implemented Siri as cornerstone features of both the Apple Watch and new Apple TV, and for 2016, Siri is planned to finally make its way to the Mac.\nApple had been testing versions of OS X internally with Siri integration since at least 2012, but sources now say that Apple has a clear vision for Siri on the Mac along with a polished user-interface and is nearly ready to launch the feature publicly. Apple is expected to introduce OS X 10.12 in June at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.\nInstead of integrating Siri as a swipe menu akin to the Mac\u2019s Notification Center or as a full screen view like on the iPhone and even the iPad Pro, Siri for the Mac will live in the Mac\u2019s Menu Bar. Similar to the Spotlight magnifying glass icon for search and notifications icon for Notification Center, a Siri icon in the top right corner of the menu bar will activate the voice control feature.\nWhen a user clicks the Siri button, a dark, transparent Siri interface will appear in the top right corner of the screen, as shown in our mockup by Michael Steeber. This interface will feature colorful sound waves to indicate speech input. The interface design in testing is not finalized and may still change before the summer introduction, according to sources.\nSiri on the Mac will have its own pane in System Preferences and users are said to also have the option to choose a keyboard shortcut for activating the service. Like with recent versions of iOS, users will be able to enable Siri at the first startup of OS X 10.12, according to sources. If the Mac running the new OS X version is plugged into power, a \u201cHey Siri\u201d command will work much like with recent iPhone and iPad models.\nCodenamed \u201cFuji,\u201d OS X 10.12 is also planned to include minor user-interface tweaks across core system application windows, but the changes will not be as notable as those in 2014\u2019s OS X Yosemite update. Apple is also continuing its performance-focused engineering efforts emphasized in OS X El Capitan last year. The company is also developing iOS 10 for the fall, and we\u2019ll be posting details on that in the near future.",

        "body": "Head over to our on-demand library to view sessions from VB Transform 2023. Register Here\nThe FBI wants to compel Apple to write a new, modified operating system, load to it their central security key, and install it on a cell phone used by Syed Farook, one of the terrorists who carried out the San Bernardino attack. The request seems simple and harmless, as well as morally sound, at least on the surface. And since Apple writes updates to the IOS software all the time, the argument that it would be a huge burden for the company to create the OS needed to unlock this phone does not stand up to any rational inspection.\nWhat Apple can\u2019t do \u2014 what it shouldn\u2019t do \u2014 is reassemble and release the secret key cipher that allows it to load its OS on phones. Without this step, it is impossible to unlock this phone. But here are the risks \u2014 to Apple and to the rest of us \u2014 if that happens.\nErosion of trust and value\nFirst, while I\u2019m not privy to the exact way Apple manages its OS secret key, I believe it\u2019s probably one of the most closely guarded secrets in the corporate world. It\u2019s likely that no one single person manages the key and that the codes and permissions of many people are required to open it. Second, these individuals probably don\u2019t have visibility or access to the fully assembled key and aren\u2019t allowed to know where the assembly occurs. These are the kinds of security controls that would have to be in place for a $500 billion company to maintain the trust of its customers.\nAnd that\u2019s what this is about: Trust. The value of Apple can almost exclusively be defined as trust. I trust Apple with my personal data, my pictures, my conversations, my work data, my credit card data, and so on. Artists entrust their creative content (songs, movies, books, etc.) to Apple, believing that they will be compensated and their content remain protected. Merchants trust the security of Apple Pay. If Apple ends up building this OS \u2014 and assembling the signature keys for this one phone \u2014 that trust goes away. Apple could lose billions of dollars of valuation because this trust was breached. Like a reputation, trust takes companies years to earn but can be destroyed in seconds.\nEvent VB Transform 2023 On-Demand Did you miss a session from VB Transform 2023? Register to access the on-demand library for all of our featured sessions. Register Now\nA slippery slope and criminal opportunity\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the false argument that this is a one-time request and that the secret keys and OS wouldn\u2019t be leaked. Once the break-in is available, why should Apple refuse to unlock the phone of a regular criminal? Why not unlock the phone of a drug dealer to find his customers? Why not unlock a phone that was found near a crime scene? Why not unlock your phone to see if you are breaking the law? Furthermore, if this OS were built, criminals throughout the world would pay handsomely to get their hands on it. Are all the technicians who have the ability to do this trustworthy individuals? What if the coercion tactic was a death threat to their families?\nQuestionable effectiveness or benefit\nFinally, I think we have to ask ourselves: To what end are the FBI\u2019s requested efforts? The San Bernardino criminals had phones, computers and other devices that they used before, during, and shortly after the crimes and that they fully and completely physically destroyed. Do we think that Mr. Farook made his plots on his work phone and then forgot to bring it along when he destroyed his computer? I think we all know that this is unlikely.\nLike others in my industry, I have a personal stake in the outcome of Apple\u2019s case. For most of my career, I have provided communication networks to businesses. These businesses \u2014 my clients \u2014 expect their communications to be private and their data to be secured. While in certain countries we have an obligation to provide lawful intercept for public telephone calls if requested by a warrant, the technology to encrypt calls from source to destination \u2014 with no ability for a technology company in the middle to intercept, whether compelled to do so by a court or not \u2014 is available.\nThese end-to-end encryption tools are simple and widely available. Criminals can at any time write their own end-to-end encrypted apps and then not even Apple \u2014 nor all the king\u2019s horses and men \u2014 can intercept. So again, the U.S. government wants Apple to put itself at grave fiduciary risk for no gain for the public at large. And criminals get an early start on their big, shiny gift of unbreakable communications.\nWe all need to think long and hard about what we will fight to keep private, because the government is coming with its emotional arguments, and it looks like they\u2019ll leave no place unturned.\nCurtis Peterson is senior vice president of operations at RingCentral.",

        "title": "Eddy Cue: \"We've got a new refresh [of iTunes] with the new version of OS X that's coming out next month that makes it even easier to use in the music space.\"",
        "body": "Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi spoke with John Gruber in this week's episode of \"The Talk Show,\" where they commented on recent opinions that Apple's software isn't up to snuff and offered some details on a new version of iTunes coming in OS X 10.11.4.\nLast week, Re/code's Walt Mossberg wrote a piece entitled \"Apple's Apps Need Work,\" pointing towards a \"gradual degradation\" in quality in several Apple apps and services like iCloud, Mail, and Photos. iTunes for the desktop was one of the most heavily criticized apps, with Mossberg saying he \"dreads\" opening it because it's \"bloated, complex, and sluggish.\"\nDuring the podcast, Gruber asked Eddy Cue about Mossberg's opinion, prompting him to give some background on how Apple wanted the iTunes experience to work. iTunes, Cue said, was designed at a time when people synced their devices via cable, so offering a centralized place with all of a user's content was key. With Apple Music, Apple decided on a design that would put music front and center while also integrating cloud music with hard copies purchased through iTunes.\n\"We decided in the short term that what we wanted to do is really make it when you're in music and iTunes, all you see is music,\" said Cue. He went on to explain that Apple is continually re-evaluating iTunes, and there are plans to release a refreshed version alongside OS X 10.11.4 next month.\n\"That's not to say we are continuing... and will continue to think about what's the best way to architect the app and whether it makes sense to do a separate app for some of the components that are in there or all of the components that are in there. But right now, we think we've designed iTunes and you'll see we've got a new refresh with the new version of OS X that's coming out next month that makes it even easier to use in the music space.\"\nCue and Federighi went on to talk about the issues that arise whenever Apple makes major changes to software, as there are always people who prefer not to see significant changes. According to Federighi, there's a \"tricky balancing act\" with software updates.\n\"People are serious about their music and their collection, and so I think we debate pretty heavily internally the right way to evolve these things. We tend to err on the side of being pretty bold, but there's a lot of responsibility.\nThe two also highlighted the immense scale that Apple is working on, with more than 1 billion active devices and 782 million iCloud users. More than 200,000 iMessages per second are sent at peak times, and there are more than 750 million transactions per week in the iTunes Store and the App Store. Apple Music has grown to 11 million subscribers and more than 2.5 million errors in Maps have been fixed, a number presented as evidence that Apple is continually working on its software.\n\"I would say first there's nothing we care about more,\" said Federighi, speaking on Apple's software and services. He believes Apple's core software quality has improved significantly over the course of the last five years, but pointed towards an ever-raising bar that pushes Apple to keep evolving and implementing new features. \"Every year we realize the things we were good at last year and the techniques we were using to build the best software we can are not adequate for the next year because the bar keeps going up,\" he said.\nFederighi and Cue's full discussion with John Gruber about the state of software, the desktop version of iTunes, and Apple's efforts to expand its public beta program, can be listed to over on the Daring Fireball website.",

        "title": "Warning: Bug in Adobe Creative Cloud deletes Mac user data without warning",
        "body": "Adobe Systems has stopped distributing a recently issued update to its Creative Cloud graphics service amid reports a Mac version can delete important user data without warning or permission.\nThe deletions happen whenever Mac users log in to the Adobe service after the update has been installed, according to officials from Backblaze, a data backup service whose users are being disproportionately inconvenienced by the bug. Upon sign in, a script activated by Creative Cloud deletes the contents in the alphabetically first folder in a Mac's root directory. Backblaze users are being especially hit by the bug because the backup service relies on data stored in a hidden root folder called .bzvol. Because the folder is the alphabetically top-most hidden folder at the root of so many users' drives, they are affected more than users of many other software packages.\n\"This caused a lot of our customers to freak out,\" Backblaze Marketing Manager Yev Pusin wrote in an e-mail. \"The reason we saw a huge uptick from our customers is because Backblaze's .bzvol is higher up the alphabet. We tested it again by creating a hidden file with an '.a' name, and the files inside were removed as well.\"\nBackblaze officials have published three videos that show the deletion bug in action, including the one below.\nOn Friday morning, Adobe Creative Cloud users flooded Twitter with complaints about the unauthorized data deletions. Many users who don't use Backblaze (the reporter of this Ars story included) will find the first folder in their Mac root drive is .DocumentRevisions-V100,\na folder that stores data required for Mac autosave and Version history functions to work properly. Deleting its contents could have negative consequences. The Adobe bug could also have dire consequences for users who have important folders with spaces in them, since those also assume a top alphabetically sorted spot on the Mac hard drive (which by default is labeled Macintosh HD).\nAdvertisement\nAn Adobe spokeswoman issued a statement that read: \"We are aware that some customers have experienced this issue and we are investigating in order to resolve the matter as quickly as possible. We are stopping the distribution of the update until the issue has been resolved.\" The version that appears to be causing the deletions is 3.5.0.206, Pusin said.\nCreative Cloud users who have not yet installed the update should hold off doing so until Adobe releases detailed guidance. People who have already installed the update shouldn't log in for the time being. One work-around for people who have installed the update and want to log in right away is to create a folder that assumes the alphabetically top-most spot in the root folder. A hidden folder with the name \".aaaaa\" comes to mind, but the Backblaze guidance, perhaps offering some comic relief for its aggrieved users, suggested creating a folder called \".adobedontdeletemybzvol.\"\nTo do so, users can Open Terminal and paste in \"cd /\" followed by \"sudo mkdir /.adobedontdeletemybzvol\" (minus the quotes).",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Elephant in the Room",
        "body": "Apple\u2019s Elephant in the Room Alexandra Mintsopoulos \u00b7 Follow \u00b7 Feb 14, 2016 4 min read -- Listen Share\nI\u2019ve been watching the story about Apple\u2019s \u201cdeclining software quality\u201d unfold over the past year with amusement but never felt the need to write anything contesting this narrative until John Siracusa (on episode 155 of Accidental Tech Podcast) came to the conclusion that the problem must be real because the story keeps coming back up. To John\u2019s credit, he allowed for the possibility that this is a perception problem but ultimately concluded otherwise because \u201cno one else seems to be disagreeing\u201d. I disagree.\nThis is in fact a perception problem, and one that originated from Marco Arment\u2019s blog post over a year ago. A comment on a recent Reddit thread got to the crux of the matter:\nThere\u2019s a reason why Marco\u2019s \u201cFunctional high ground\u201d post took off, it\u2019s because it was vague enough that everyone could project whatever current bug they\u2019re facing on to it.\nAs the comment noted there were no examples cited, which was a critical factor in it going viral. It suggested an urgency and a sudden onset of this crisis. Apple was great before but now they\u2019ve lost their way.\nIt wasn\u2019t until July, seven months after Marco\u2019s original post, that we saw Marco publish a follow-up essentially admitting that the premise of his original post was based on the buggy discoveryd service that Apple had shipped (and replaced again with mDNSResponder). Hedged no doubt, but as close as you\u2019ll get to a retraction:\nThe entire decline of software quality that I felt in January wasn\u2019t all due to a single buggy network-lookup service \u2014 but, unbeknownst to me at the time, alot of it was. And that huge swath of problems that annoyed me every day disappeared instantly and completely as soon as I updated every computer on the network to 10.10.4.\nOf course this post wasn\u2019t as widely read. In the intervening time the narrative had taken root, it was hashed and rehashed countless times by the Apple pundits with blogs and podcasts and eventually the Apple community of developers and fans had come to accept it as truth.\nToday the \u201cdeclining software quality\u201d narrative is the explanation not only for every bug experienced (despite the size of the affected user base) but also for product design decisions. The recent release of the Apple TV was lambasted by journalists and Apple bloggers for lacking features such as a remote app or keyboard support. Jessie Char captured the mood:\nWe now know from Craig Federighi and Eddy Cue on John Gruber\u2019s podcast that many of these features were essentially unused by anyone who wasn\u2019t a developer.\nWhat\u2019s going on? It\u2019s a little interesting that John Siracusa mentioned that he isn\u2019t seeing anyone disagreeing with the notion of Apple\u2019s declining software quality because he himself completely disagreed with it when Marco\u2019s original post was first published. If you follow enough people on Tech Twitter and listen to enough podcasts, you will begin to see this small and insular group start to say and believe the same things, which eventually leads to their audience coming to believe it as well. This echo chamber phenomenon is what I believe is at the root of this narrative and something John identified.\nMarco is clearly in the \u201cout of love\u201d phase of the cycle. He has stated that part of why he wants to get a Tesla is because of wanting to be a fan of something new and to be on the ground floor. His frequent \u201ccynical takes\u201d on what Apple\u2019s intentions are, are related. In fact he came to this realization himself on episode 148 of Accidental Tech Podcast; Apple is getting too big for his liking and he doesn\u2019t seem to like that Apple\u2019s focus is on anything but the Mac (John\u2019s response to him was both insightful and self-aware).\nMarco frequently asserts that Apple is measuring the wrong things, that they are tunnel visioned on metrics such as crash rates of their software while missing the forest for the trees, which implies that Apple executives and engineers don\u2019t use their own products. The notion is silly and not borne by the facts. Apple\u2019s installed base of users has grown massively over the past few years. Even if you dismiss this as a lagging indicator what you cannot dismiss is that customer satisfaction remains at an all-time high. More importantly, actual usage of Apple\u2019s products and services continues unabated, something you would not expect if Apple\u2019s software quality were truly declining. It\u2019s likely that Apple\u2019s disclosure that there are over a billion active devices in-use is designed to counter this narrative.\nIf the biggest example that can be pointed to is iTunes or its back-end (which seem to generate the most criticism) then there isn\u2019t any validity to the idea that Apple\u2019s software quality is declining. iTunes has been the target of complaints for as long as anyone can remember and it seems clear that it will be reworked much like Photos, iWork, or Final Cut have been (and likely receive the same backlash for missing functionality). The reason it hasn\u2019t been done sooner is obvious: it has hundreds of millions of users and transacts billions of dollars in sales, revamping it from the ground up is akin to fixing an airplane while it\u2019s in flight and won\u2019t be done lightly.\nThere is a massive disconnect between enthusiasts and Apple\u2019s broader customer base on the perception of Apple\u2019s software quality. That is a PR problem for Apple to solve, not a software one.",

        "title": "\u2018Error 53\u2019 May Be a Drag, But It\u2019s Vital to Keep iPhone Users\u2019 Data Safe",
        "body": "Apple came under fire on Friday over a security feature that some iPhone users say rendered their smartphones inoperable bricks after they were repaired by third-party service centers.\nThese users have noted on websites like gadget repair clearinghouse iFixit.com that an error message, \"error 53,\" sometimes appears on their iPhone after non-Apple technicians repair a broken Home button or the cable that connects the Home button to the iPhone's motherboard. Kyle Wiens, the CEO of IFixit, told The Guardianthat the issue may be a \"big problem\" for iPhone users given that the message board thread discussing the issue has already amassed more than 183,000 hits.\nAdvertisement\nApple says the error message is part of a security feature designed to protect iPhone users' data. According to Apple, error 53 is triggered whenever a security test between the Touch ID sensor and the iPhone's \"Secure Enclave\" (which processes fingerprint data, which in turn is used to unlock the smartphone and authorize purchases on the App Store) fails. Authorized Apple service centers are able to re-validate the secure connection whenever Home button repairs are made.\nWhile that may seem cold comfort to some users, security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski told me in an email that Apple's efforts represent a \"basic anti-tampering mechanism,\" and are an \"overall good idea.\"\nIn Zdziarski's view, the security feature is \"especially useful\" in a number of different scenarios, including the protection of \"high-profile individuals whose devices could possibly be bugged.\" Zdziarski also pointed to the recent development of tools like IP-Box that can brute force crack an iPhone PIN code. \"It would not surprise me to see a future black box capable of either brute forcing biometrics, or transmitting biometric data from prints taken from other sources,\" he added.\nIn other words, while strictly protecting the integrity of the Touch ID fingerprint sensor may inadvertently create problems for some users, failing to do so may create even larger problems.\n\"If [Apple] knew there were a lot of knock-off parts being used, I'd think [it would] have issued a warning of some sort,\" Zdziarski said, explaining that a glut of cheap parts on the market would \"impact [Apple's] own repair and warranty programs.\"\nAll of this \"leads me to believe [Apple was] probably doing [error 53] for security reasons more than just to mess with users,\" he added. While perhaps true, it does make repairing the iPhone that much more difficult for everyday users, particularly if there's not an authorized Apple repair center nearby. It also speaks to the larger, and perhaps more worrying, trend of the increased difficulty of repairing gadgets without a manufacturer's blessing: Apple protecting the data of its users is admirable, of course, but doing so in a manner that diminishes their freedom to repair is difficult to swallow.",

        "body": "We never thought that we will see a new, major stable version of the Transmission open-source and cross-platform BitTorrent client, ever, but what a surprise, Transmission 2.90 arrived on February 28, 2016.\nNot only that, but looking at the changelog, we can notice that Transmission 2.90 is a major release, hence the new version number. There are over 50 changes in this release of the free BitTorrent everyone loves and use, besides uTorrent, of course, which is full of adware.\nProminent features of Transmission 2.90 include better renaming of torrents with a common prefix, support for PolarSSL, CyaSSL, and WolfSSL cryptographic backends, support for OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later, CMake support, lots of improvements for Windows systems and removal of support for Windows XP/2003 and Vista.\nMoreover, Transmission 2.90 adds support for the miniupnpc 14 API and libevent 2.1 library or higher versions, implements absolute paths as a requirement in RPC (Remote Procedure Call) requests, unifies the display of torrent's origin for all clients, improves validity checking of UTF-8, and no longer build transmission-cli by default.\nGTK+, Qt, Web, and Mac clients received improvements\nBesides the general changes mentioned above, the official changelog also notes the fact that the Mac build of Transmission received a lot of love for this major release, such as user interface improvements for Mac OS X 10.9 or later, support for trimming potential URIs from clipboard, and support for downloading from HTTP servers on El Capitan. Please note that Mac OS X 10.6 is no longer supported.\nWhile the GTK+ client received only two fixes, one of them being related to support for GTK+ 3.16 or higher, the Qt client got multiple improvements, among which we can mention the addition of a context menu on the files tab of the Torrent Properties dialog, improvements to the filter bar look and feel, and better magnets handling. The Transmission daemon and web client also received various fixes.\nDownload Transmission 2.90 for GNU/Linux and Mac OS X.",
