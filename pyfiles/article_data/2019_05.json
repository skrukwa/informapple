        "body": "\"This problem doesn't get any easier based on whose side wins or loses an election. It's about who has won life's lottery and has the luxury of ignoring this issue and who stands to lose everything,\" Cook said. \"The coastal communities, including some right here in Louisiana, that are also making plans to leave behind the places they have called home for generations and head for higher ground. The fisherman who nets come up empty. The wildlife preserves with less wildlife to preserve, the marginalized, for whom a natural disaster can mean enduring poverty.\"\n\"Here today, in this very place, where thousands once found desperate shelter from a hundred-year disaster \u2014 the kind that seem to be happening more and more frequently \u2014 I don't think we can talk about who we are as people and what we owe to one another without talking about climate change,\" Cook said.\n\"You don't need to look far to find an example of that failure,\" Cook said, referring to New Orleans, where he was speaking, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\"We have spent too much time debating, we have been too focused on the fight, and not focused enough on progress,\" Cook, 58 and a member of the Boomer generation , said. Generally, college graduates are part of Generation Z .\n\"In some important ways, my generation has failed you,\" Cook said Saturday in his commencement speech at Tulane University in New Orleans, La., at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.\nMore broadly, Cook called on the class of 2019 to focus on helping others, starting with those who need the most.\n\"When we talk about climate change or any issue with human cost \u2014 and there are many \u2014 I challenge you to look for those who have the most to lose, and find the real, true empathy that comes from something shared. That is really what we owe one another,\" Cook said.\nFrom the Big Easy, the tech executive seemed to be taking a shot at the divisiveness taking root in Washington D.C. and corrupting the fabric of the country.\n\"When you do [find empathy], the political noise dies down and you can feel your feet firmly planted on solid ground. After all, we don't build monuments to trolls and we are not going to start now,\" Cook said.\nTo reduce that divisiveness, Cook pleaded with the young graduates to resist entrenched thinking and adopting points of view blindly.\n\"There are some who would like you to believe that the only way you can be strong is by bulldozing those who disagree or never giving them a chance to say their piece in the first place, that the only way you can build your own accomplishments is by tearing down the other side,\" he said.\n\"We forget sometimes that our preexisting beliefs have their own force of gravity. Today, certain algorithms pull towards you the things you already know, believe or like and they push away everything else. Push back. It shouldn't be this way,\" Cook said. \"But in 2019, opening your eyes and seeing things in a new way can be a revolutionary act.\"\nWork to understand the perspectives of those who see an issue differently than you do, Cook said.\n\"Summon the courage not just to hear but to listen. Not just to act but to act together. It can sometimes feel like the odds are stacked against you, that it isn't worth it. That the critics are too persistent and the problems are too great. But the solution to our problems begin on a human scale by building a shared understanding of the work ahead, and with undertaking it together. at the very least we owe it to teach other to try.\"\nAbove all, Cook called upon the graduating class to take action to improve the world they live in.\n\"Whatever you do, don't make the mistake of being too cautious,\" said Cook. \"Don't assume that by staying put, the ground won't move beneath your feet. The status quo simply won't last. So get to work on building something better.\"\nSee also:\nApple CEO Tim Cook: 'Don't work for money ... you will never be happy'\nThis start-up turns pollution from factories into fuel that powers cars \u2014 and one day planes\nApple CEO Tim Cook: 'The world is full of cynics and you have to tune them out'",

        "body": "Apple has just announced a new iPod touch featuring an Apple A10 Fusion chip. The new iPod looks the same as the previous generation, with a 4-inch screen flanked by large bezels and a non-Touch ID physical home button.\nIn addition to the new chip, the device comes in a 256 GB model for the first time. The 2019 iPod touch is available to order online now at $199 for 32 GB storage, $299 for 128 GB and $399 for the 256 GB configuration.\nThe iPod touch was last refreshed in 2015. That model did not support features like ARKit or Group FaceTime as the A8 processor was not powerful enough.\nThis means the iPod touch finally joins the Group FaceTime compatible device family with today\u2019s update.\nThe Touch continues to lag behind the rest of the iOS lineup. Its chassis design has not changed since 2012, which means it lacks biometric authentication of any kind: no Touch ID, no Face ID.\nIt also keeps the same 4-inch screen as before; a handheld games console could probably benefit from a bigger display. All the same, Apple\u2019s marketing pages for the new Touch are already hyping up the Apple Arcade games subscription service, which is launching later this year.\nToday\u2019s processor bump update is doubly disappointing as it doesn\u2019t even get the latest-gen A11 chip, just a measly A10.\nApple is set to announce iOS 13 next week. For the iPod touch, the company often only supports the latest-generation device. With the release of the seventh-generation model today, it is likely that the 2015-2018 sixth-generation Touch will now be discontinued as far as software updates are concerned.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "Apple increases iPhone cellular download limit from 150 MB to 200 MB",
        "body": "This week, Apple has upped the cellular download limit for iPhone and iPad that prevents users from downloading large files from Apple\u2019s stores, including apps, games, video podcasts, iTunes Store films and more.\nThe cellular download limit has been increased from 150 MB to 200 MB. This means more apps and games are now allowed to be downloaded over cellular networks.\nThe file size limit prevents iOS users from accidentally downloading a big game on LTE and blowing through their carrier\u2019s data cap. However, the cellular limit is often mocked as a stupid feature as Apple offers no opportunity to override the limit and force the download to succeed.\nIt is also silly because the cellular limit is enforced non-discriminately, which means even iPhone users with unlimited data plans are still barred from downloading apps and games over 200 MB.\nThe limit would be better implemented as a warning, informing the user that they are about to download a large file but including a \u2018Continue Download\u2019 button to allow the download to complete. Even users with capped data plans may need a big app in a pinch from time to time.\nThe cellular limit was last increased in September 2017, from 100 MB to 150 MB. It\u2019s slow progress.\nOne important gotcha when testing iOS\u2019 cellular download limit is that it is tested against the thinned, compressed file size. The App Store reports app file sizes before they are thinned.\nFor example, you can now probably successfully download a game over cellular that is listed around 240 MB in size on the App Store. This does not mean the cellular limit is 240 MB. What it means is the version of the game that is being downloaded \u2014 which has irrelevant assets stripped away, like artwork only used on the iPad version of the game \u2014 is below the real 200 MB limit.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "body": "A rumor from iPhonesoft.fr out today suggests that iOS 13 will cut off several generations of iPhone. With iOS 12, Apple supported every device that could run iOS 11, boosting performance across all models all the way back to iPhone 5s. If today\u2019s report is to believed, it is the end road for a large chunk of active iPhone models.\nThe report claims that iOS 13 will drop support for iPhone 5s, iPhone SE, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.\nFirst debuted in 2014, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus cycle was incredibly successful for Apple and continues to hold the crown as the best-selling iPhone generation.\nIf this report is correct, there will be a substantial pile of devices that can no longer update to the newest iOS version come September. It would also mean that the iPhone 5s got one extra year of iOS updates than the iPhone 6 generation. iPhone SE users would really be drawing the short straw, as the product is only three years old.\nIt is possible that Apple wants to stop supporting 4-inch iPhone screen sizes with iOS 13; ending compatibility for 5s and SE would make strides towards that. The iPod touch remains a thorn in Apple\u2019s side, as the company only sells one model of iPod touch \u2026 and that model features a 4-inch display.\nOn the iPad side, iPhonesoft reports that only the iPad mini 2 and the iPad Air will not be able to install iOS 13. The iPad Air was launched in 2013, the same year as iPhone 5s.\nWe\u2019ll know for sure when Apple officially announces iOS 13 at WWDC on June 3.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "Apple made informal bid to buy Tesla at $240 per share in 2013",
        "body": "Tesla Model X\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nApple's automotive ambitions could have been augmented with the acquisition of Tesla, an analyst claims, with the iPhone maker said to have made a \"serious bid\" to buy the electric car producer in 2013, a move that could have brought technology developed under \"Project Titan\" to commercialization far earlier.\nApple has seemingly harbored plans to produce its own brand of vehicle \u2014 or Apple Care \u2014 for some time under the codename \"Project Titan,\" though speculation has hinted at the possibility of Apple using its massive resources to get a head start in the market by purchasing an auto manufacturer instead of working entirely from scratch. According to a recent TV interview, it seems Apple tried to do just that.\nSpeaking on CNBC on Tuesday, Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin claimed Apple made a \"serious bid\" to purchase Tesla, around 2013, with the offer supposedly in the region of $240 per share. It is unclear how far along the alleged negotiations went, such as a \"formal paperwork stage\" that would signal an intent to purchase.\nWhile there is only the word of Irwin that the bid was made, he insists \"multiple checks\" were made with multiple sources, and he has \"complete confidence\" that it is \"credible.\" At this time there is barely any evidence or other claims that such a bid existed at all.\nA profile of Apple's mergers and acquisitions chief Adrian Perica in February 2014 included references to a meeting between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple CEO Tim Cook in Cupertino in 2013, at around the same time as a German analyst wrote an open letter to Cook suggesting an Apple purchase of Tesla. That report cited multiple sources about the supposed meeting, but again with little proof it actually took place.\nIf Apple is still interested in acquiring a manufacturer to make its own vehicle, the televised segment suggests Tesla could be a good target for such a purchase once more, as the price has dropped down far enough to make it an attractive target. At the time of publication, Tesla is hovering at around $205 per share, far below the $240 supposedly bid six years ago by Apple.\nTesla's share price has taken a beating over the last six months, and is currently close to half the $376.79 recorded for the stock on December 13. The pain could continue for the Elon Musk-led company for a while longer, as the note proposed a worst case scenario of Tesla's stock dropping to just $10.\nIrwin's declaration about Apple continued with the claim \"Project Titan\" is still very much alive, including the continued development of advanced battery technology for use in future vehicles.\nSo far, Apple's public vehicular efforts have revolved around Lexus, with the manufacturer's cars used as a testbed for \"Project Titan's\" self driving systems. Volkswagen has also been linked to another effort dubbed PAIL, or Palo Alto to Infinite Loop, a project that uses modified T6 Transporter vans to shuttle employees between Apple offices.",

        "title": "Latest 2019 iPhone molds leak once again show square camera bump coming to all three new phones",
        "body": "As Apple readies its supply chain for the fall iPhone bonanza, we are getting leaks thick and fast. This latest image was uploaded to Twitter by Mark Gurman.\nIt reaffirms renders from OnLeaks that all three flagship iPhones this year will feature the new square camera bump design, including the iPhone XR that will only have two cameras.\nMolds are used by case manufacturers to test compatibility with upcoming cases, and are typically based on leaked schematics and dimensions coming out of the Apple/Foxconn factory. They may not show every crevice and indentation of a phone\u2019s design, but width/height/thickness is usually accurate and they depict holes for things like speakers, cameras, buttons, and microphones, that accessory manufacturers need to ensure their cases do not cover important components.\nThe leaks for iPhone 11 have been somewhat controversial as the new camera bump is so large that it dominates the back of the device. In particular, the lenses inside the rounded-square are oddly arranged. They seem to follow a triangular layout, with the camera flash and microphone placed awkwardly above and below the spoke of the triangle. It\u2019s a weird aesthetic for a module that is housed in a square.\nAt superficial glances, it seems cruder compared to the sleeker vertical dual-camera module used in iPhone X and iPhone XS. It is even more strange that the 2019 iPhone XR will seemingly also be getting a square notch even though it will only feature two cameras, not three.\nOnLeaks was first to share news of the square camera bump, posting accurate iPhone 11 renders as early as January.\nNow, Apple is widely expected to announce substantial camera upgrades that may justify the strange design. For example, the third camera coming to iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Max is believed to be an ultra-wide lens made by Sony.\nThe explanation for the 2019 iPhone XR is less clear, although the consistent design does make up for a distinctive iPhone generational family. In a story last week, Bloomberg said the new camera will result in more detailed photos and Apple is purportedly working on a feature that will change the framing of a shot after a user has taken a picture, in cases where a person may have been accidentally chopped off.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "body": "Apple stock ($AAPL) has once again crossed the $1 trillion market cap level as its shares rose 6% in early trading following its Q2 earnings call.\nAAPL stock is currently priced at $212.68, with a market cap of approximately $1,003,000,000,000. The company stock closed at around $200 yesterday but rocketed upwards in the wake of Apple reporting its financial results for the financial quarter just gone.\nAlthough iPhone revenue declined 17% year over year, the sharp downturn in iPhone sales seen in the holiday quarter is steadily recovering with Tim Cook describing November and December as \u2018the trough\u2019. Combined, sales from all Apple\u2019s hardware products was down 9% compared to the same period in 2018, but this shortfall is almost entirely due to the iPhone; it appears sales of iPads, Macs, and Watches are better than ever.\nMeanwhile, Apple\u2019s Services division grew 16% and the iPad business saw its highest growth rates in six years. Apple is pushing the services narrative as its future growth trajectory, and everyone is watching to see how its new offerings like News+, Apple TV+, and Apple Arcade are received.\nFor the most recent quarter, wearables sales also continued to be strong. In fact, Apple\u2019s \u2018Wearables, Home and Accessories\u2019 business segment now rivals the iPad in terms of revenue. Apple said that three-quarters of Apple Watch sales were to customers new to the product.\nOf course, the stock market is prone to volatility and stock prices change regularly. The trillion-dollar figure is a more symbolic gesture than anything else. Apple became the first publicly traded trillion-dollar company in August 2018. A fall in demand for iPhones in China promptly saw Apple\u2019s valuation tumble in the last few months of the year. In 2019, Apple company value has gained 49% from the January lows.\nFor fiscal Q3, April to June, Apple expects revenues between $52.4-$54.5bn.

        "body": "If you frequent the New York City subway\u2019s 4, 5, 6 line, you\u2019ve probably seen the new terminals at a variety of stations like Union Square and Grand Central. Located between turnstiles, they\u2019ve all been sporting a curious \u201cTest Phase/Coming Soon\u201d screen. That finally changes this week.\nGoogle already announced its mobile pay solution would be arriving this week, and now its chief competitor is getting in on the action. Apple Pay is hitting select stations this Friday, May 31. When that kicks in, riders will be able to swipe their iPhone or Apple Watch to catch a ride.\nThe kiosks are actually active, at present, but using them requires a software update \u2014 iOS 12.3 and watchOS 5.2.1, respectively. Then a debit or credit card needs to be associated with Express Transit in Apple Wallet, using Face or Touch ID. Once installed, it should work on the iPhone 6s and SE or later, along with the Apple Watch Series 1, 2 and 3, using NFC to get you in.\nThe system works as you\u2019d expect. Hold the phone or watch up to the display and it beeps you in with a big \u201cGo\u201d on the screen, and a \u201cDone\u201d registering on the device. As long as your credit card is up to date, you should be good to go. How quickly this all works when thousands of New Yorkers are all using the system is another question entirely, of course \u2014 there tends to be a kind of learning curve with these sorts of things. And no doubt there will be a bit of a logjam at the turnstiles before the novelty of the system wears off.\nOf course, that\u2019s why this is still a kind of test period. At present, the system will be limited to the 4, 5, 6 line between Grand Central-42 Street in Manhattan and Atlantic Ave-Barclays Center in Brooklyn (16 stations in all), along with Staten Island buses. In the case of the 4, 5, 6, that\u2019s almost certainly the most heavily trafficked stations on the most heavily trafficked subway line, so this will be an interesting sort of trial by fire.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the system is currently limited to single-ride passes. That means those who buy daily, weekly or monthly passes (which applies to many New Yorkers, myself included) won\u2019t be able to use the system in that capacity. More fare options are coming by late 2020, by which time the MTA expects to have rolled out Apple on all subway lines and buses, so riders will never have to worry about losing that Metro Card again.",

The analysts gathered this information from Apple suppliers following a trip to Asia earlier this month.\nThis isn't the first time we've heard this rumor. The Wall Street Journal said the same thing back in January.\nApple already replaced \u200c3D Touch\u200c with Haptic Touch on the iPhone XR in order to achieve a nearly edge-to-edge LCD on the device, and it is likely the feature will be expanded to all 2019 iPhones. Haptic Touch is simply a marketing name for a long press combined with haptic feedback from the Taptic Engine.\nIt's unclear why Apple would remove \u200c3D Touch\u200c from the next-generation \u200ciPhone\u200c XS and \u200ciPhone\u200c XS Max, since Apple has already proven that it can integrate the feature into edge-to-edge OLED displays without issue.\n\u200cHaptic Touch\u200c on the \u200ciPhone\u200c XR works in fewer places than \u200c3D Touch\u200c, including the flashlight and camera shortcuts on the lock screen, in Control Center to view hidden toggles, and to expand notifications. \u200cHaptic Touch\u200c does not support Quick Actions app menus or Peek and Pop for previewing content.\n\u200c3D Touch\u200c features: Quick Actions on left, Peek and Pop on right\nPerhaps we'll see some hints that \u200c3D Touch\u200c is going away entirely in iOS 13, which Apple is expected to unveil at its WWDC 2019 keynote next Monday.

The seven winners, divided into three categories, were chosen by a distinguished panel of experts who evaluated the nominees for their degree of technical innovation and commercial significance, in addition to their potential for positive social impact.\nThe winning products and a brief description of each are listed below.\nDisplays of the Year:\nGranted to display products with the most significant technological advances and/or outstanding features. The winners include:\nApple\u2019s LTPO OLED Display for Apple Watch Series 4\nWhile retaining the original signature design, the fourth-generation Apple Watch has been refined, combining new hardware and software enhancements into a singular, unified form. The striking display, which is more than 30 percent larger at 40 mm or 44 mm, depending on the model, seamlessly integrates into the thinner, smaller case, while the new interface provides more information with richer detail. The display is the defining feature of Apple Watch, and Series 4 pushes that feature farther than ever. The challenge for designers was to make the display bigger without noticeably increasing the size of the case or compromising the battery life. Narrower borders enable a viewing area that\u2019s more than 30 percent larger, while a new display technology called LTPO improves power efficiency, helping users get through the day on a single charge.\nSamsung Electronics\u2019 Modular MicroLED Display (The Wall)\nThe Wall is a display based on microLED technology. It is made up of millions of individual pixels of self-emitting inorganic red, green, and blue microscopic LED chips to produce brilliant colors and deep blacks onscreen for striking picture quality. The display is immune to burn-in and has a lifespan of 100,000 hours. Along with its microLED-based technology, Samsung\u2019s Quantum Processor Modular and AI-Upscaling help The Wall achieve pristine picture quality up to 8Kresolution, as well as pure colors, stunning high-dynamic range (HDR) 10+, and a peak luminance of up to 2,000 nits. MicroLED technology is a desirable alternative to other display technologies because, while it is made up of self-emitting pixels that turn on and off individually, its inorganic materials won\u2019t degrade or cause screen burn-in over time. Additionally, Samsung\u2019s unique Black Seal technology that is applied to each microLED creates a seamless, uniform canvas with deeper blacks than ever before. The Wall is a large-format modular display ideal for both luxury living and business.\nSony Corp.\u2019s Crystal LED Display System\nThe Crystal LED Display System from Sony consists of a display controller and modular display units made from ultrafine microLEDs. This technology creates spectacular, large-scale video walls with lifelike realism. Crystal LED brings imagery to life with awe-inspiring visuals in any environment, with applications ranging from industrial product design and manufacturing to theme parks and museums, corporate meeting rooms and lobbies, retail showrooms, lecture theaters, and broadcast studios. In addition to high contrast, this display supports high-dynamic range (HDR), with 10-bit color depth and enormous color gamut. Sony has also developed active-matrix pixel-drive circuitry with micro ICs, which achieves an ultra-fast video response time with a 120-Hz refresh rate \u2013ideal for sports, concerts, or training simulations requiring large-screen visuals with no delay or blur. The bezel-free design of the display unit ensures no visible seam between multiple display units and makes it possible to create impressive large-scale displays of virtually any dimension and aspect ratio.\nDisplay Components of the Year\nThis award is granted for novel components that have significantly enhanced the performance of a display. A component is sold as a separate part destined to be incorporated into a display. A component may also include display-enhancing materials and/or parts fabricated with new processes. The winners include:\nDexerials Corp.\u2019s AR Films for Piano Black Design\nThe new Dexerials AR film, AR100-T0810, is glossy in appearance while maintaining a reflectivity of around 0.3 percent. The film\u2019s structure has an anti-smudge top coating, dry-sputtered layers of high and low refractive-index coatings, and clear hard coat on triacetylcellulose (TAC) substrate. Dexerials manufactures the film in a roll-to-roll process under cleanroom conditions to achieve high quality. The development of the product was motivated by several OEM requests in the North American region. Another development target was curved cover-lens compatibility. While curved cover lenses make their way into automotive displays, the materials for displays still need to meet automotive requirements. This product represents a significant step in a display field in which consumers prefer piano-black vehicle interiors. Dexerials\u2019 AR films help flat-panel and curved displays maintain a glossy appearance, achieve a dead-front aesthetic at various viewing angles, and ensure reflections don\u2019t disturb the driver.\nSCHOTT\u2019s RealView High-Refractive Index Glass Wafers\nSCHOTT RealView is a class of high-index glass wafers designed to propel the development of augmented-reality (AR) and mixed-reality (MR) smartglasses with superior image quality, enabling field-of-view closer to that of human peripheral vision. SCHOTT RealView high-index glass wafers capitalize on a total internal reflection (TIR) angle. The portfolio of refractive indices for RealView drives the field-of-view by up to 2x compared to conventional glass. SCHOTT leveraged more than 130 years\u2019 experience in glass making to develop these extremely thin, lightweight wafers to ensure users of smartglasses find them comfortable. At the same time, SCHOTT RealView features an extremely low variation in total thickness, a property that produces extremely sharp, high-contrast imaging. In this important property, SCHOTT achieved up to a factor of 10 tighter specifications compared to normal glass wafers used for semiconductor and optoelectronic applications. Researchers at SCHOTT have leveraged their expertise in glass science, melting, and hot forming, as well as surface processing of optical materials, to create a product that features superior optical properties but can also be produced efficiently in mass-market quantities. SCHOTT has invested in a global manufacturing set-up for mass-producing the very thinnest RealView wafers.\nDisplay Applications of the Year\nThis award is granted for novel and outstanding applications of a display, where the display itself is not necessarily a new device. The winners include:\nJapan Display Inc.\u2019s Curved LCDs for Automotive Dashboards\nIn 2016, JDI began design of 15.0-in. and 12.3-in. TFT LCDs for automotive cockpit use in collaboration with Volkswagen, Germany, culminating in the Tuareg SUV market introduction in May 2018. Both displays represent the world\u2019s first curved TFT LCDs in production for automotive dashboards. The curved, 3D-shaped displays, used in combination, enable a stylish and aesthetically pleasing interior dashboard, allowing automotive OEMs more flexibility in design and styling. The 15.0-in. LTPS-TFT LCD has a concave R3,000-mm-radius curved design, with 1,920 x 1,020 resolution, LED backlight with 900 cd/m2 (min) luminance, and in-cell touch functionality. The 12.3-in. LTPS-TFT LCD has a concave R1,500-mm-radius curved design, with 1,920 x 720 resolution and an LED backlight with 780 cd/m2 (min) luminance. Furthermore, the 15.0-in. TFT LCD is the world\u2019s first curved display in mass production with in-cell touch functionality.\nLenovo\u2019s Yoga Book C930 with Dual Display\nThe Yoga Book C930 is the world\u2019s first dual display laptop with E Ink \u2014 combining a QHD LCD with a multi-functional E Ink display that transforms with just one click. Type on the keyboard to send an email; sketch out your next project with a digital pen; or sit back with an e-book\u2014all on one screen, with an extra screen to spare. First among the E Ink display\u2019s multiple functions is the 10.8-in. on-screen touch keyboard. Featuring haptic feedback and an easily customizable layout, it offers a 22 percent increase in typing productivity from the previous-generation Yoga Book. And it\u2019s powered by AI, which means the more it is used, the more accurate it becomes. The E Ink display easily transforms into a notepad\u2014users can sketch, write, develop formulas, and more with the optional Lenovo Precision Pen, featuring 4,096 levels of sensitivity. When the project is done, it can be digitized with a few clicks and added to the main display. E Ink Note works seamlessly with Windows 10.\nA more comprehensive description of the award winners is included in the Display Week 2019 Show Issue of Information Display magazine or at www.informationdisplay.org.\nHigh Resolution Images are available upon request.\nAbout Display Week 2019:\nThe 56th Display Week, presented by the Society for Information Display (SID), will take place May 12-17 at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, Calif.

        "title": "AAPL drops 6% as Trump\u2019s tariffs bite: Apple accessories at 25%, overall costs could rise 10%",
        "body": "AAPL fell almost 6% in yesterday\u2019s trading in response to concerns about the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on products imported from China.\nWhile it had initially appeared that Apple had escaped the current round of tariffs, some accessories are now taxed at 25%, and Apple\u2019s component costs have also risen \u2026\nAAPL shares fell 5.81% yesterday, greater than the 2.38% fall seen in the Dow Jones index, with yesterday\u2019s antitrust ruling by the Supreme Court another factor.\nThe Verge reports that while most Apple products are not yet affected, some Apple accessories were already in the 10% band introduced in September of last year. Those products are now taxed at 25%.\nThe codes involved in Apple\u2019s \u201cadapters, chargers, cables and cords\u201d stayed on the list, and, starting last September, they have been taxed at a 10 percent rate when they entered the US from China. The same is true for iPhone cases and the iPad\u2019s leather covers, both of which are also subject to the tariff, per Apple\u2019s letter. On Friday, that jumped to 25 percent. (Apple declined to comment when reached by The Verge.) So far, that cost has been born entirely by Apple and its suppliers. The prices listed on Apple\u2019s website haven\u2019t budged since the tariffs went into effect. At $70 for a charger (which would cost you as little as $11 under other circumstances), it\u2019s possible Apple\u2019s margins are wide enough that they\u2019re able to simply eat the extra cost. It\u2019s also possible that Apple\u2019s Chinese manufacturing partners were willing to offer a slight discount in light of the tariffs. It could even be that, since September, Apple has been able to shift its supply chain around enough to dodge the impact of the tariff completely. But given Apple\u2019s massive scale and intense quality demands, such a move might have been more expensive than just paying the tariff.\nBut the indirect impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs goes further, as analysts Wedbush note.\nBased on our analysis the way the tariff situation stands today on some lithium batteries and other input materials the cost of making iPhones currently will go up by roughly 2%-3%.\nAnd the bigger fear \u2013 and the likely reason for the bulk of the share slide \u2013 is Trump\u2019s threat to extend the 25% tariff across the board, which would then hit all Apple products.\nFears [are] running rampant on the Street that these latest tariffs could significantly increase the cost of iPhones globally [with Apple] seeing pressure on both ends of the spectrum from a supply and demand perspective [\u2026] If the Trump administration decides to levy a tariff on the additional $325 billion of Chinese goods over the coming weeks/months this would be more of a potential game changer from the perspective of the incremental costs to Apple and its iPhone production with expenses that could escalate by roughly 10%+.\nEven if Trump doesn\u2019t go that far, Apple highlighted last year some other vulnerable categories that could be caught in even a small extension to the existing categories. These include the Apple Watch, AirPods and HomePod. Apple\u2019s most recent earnings report show that these products plus accessories are now worth as much to the company as iPad sales.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "body": "Napier Lopez is a writer based in New York City.

He's interested in all things tech, science, and photography related, and likes to yo-yo in his free time. Follow him on Twitter .\nTrump\u2019s Huawei ban was bad news for China, as it effectively crippled the world\u2019s second-largest smartphone maker from its largest source of income. But China is also very much in a position to retaliate, and Apple \u2013 the world\u2019s third-largest smartphone maker \u2013 could be among the ones to suffer.\nGoldman Sachs analysts estimated in a note to investors that Apple could lose 29 percent of its profits if China decided to ban Apple sales in the country to retaliate against the Huawei ban in the US. 17 percent of Apple\u2019s sales come from China, so such a move would undoubtedly be debilitating. Mind you, this is a theoretical scenario and China has no to ban Apple beyond politicking as far as we\u2019re aware \u2013 though you could say the same about the Huawei ban.\nOn the other hand, the 29 percent figure is only an estimate of Apple\u2019s losses should device sales in be halted. Apple products are also, you know, built in China.\nIf the country decided to inhibit the phone\u2019s production, Apple would face much more difficult immediate consequences. Such a move would likely be ill-advised in the long term as \u201cit could have negative implications for the China tech ecosystem as well as for local employment,\u201d note the Goldman analysts, but it\u2019s a scary possibility for Cupertino \u2013 not to mention the myriad of other American companies building their products in China. For its part, Apple has considered moving manufacturing outside of the country due to rising tariffs, but that\u2019s a lot easier said than done.\nAs consumers, the best we can hope for is that the US and China make up soon. Otherwise, this trade war could have a major adverse effect on the tech landscape.",

        "title": "iTunes Expected to Be Retired After Over 18 Years",
        "body": "While it was initially reported that iTunes would live on in macOS 10.15, it now looks like the app will be retired, over 18 years after it was introduced by the late Steve Jobs at Macworld on January 9, 2001.\nApple will be replacing iTunes with standalone Music, TV, and Podcasts apps in the next major version of macOS, expected to be unveiled at WWDC 2019 next week, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman:\nEnd of iTunes iTunes has been the way Apple users listen to music, watch movies and TV shows, hear podcasts, and manage their devices for almost two decades. This year, Apple is finally ready to move into a new era. The company is launching a trio of new apps for the Mac \u2013 Music, TV, and Podcasts \u2013 to replace iTunes. That matches Apple's media app strategy on iPhones and iPads. Without iTunes, customers can manage their Apple gadgets through the Music app.\nThis information lines up with a recent report from 9to5Mac's Guilherme Rambo, who claimed that iTunes will be renamed to \"Music\" on the Mac. In other words, iTunes is going away and will be replaced by the new Music app, which is expected to become the new utility for syncing and managing Apple devices.\nSteve Jobs quote from Apple's press release about iTunes in 2001:\nApple has done what Apple does best \u2014 make complex applications easy, and make them even more powerful in the process. iTunes is miles ahead of every other jukebox application, and we hope its dramatically simpler user interface will bring even more people into the digital music revolution.\nHere's what iTunes looked like in 2001:\niTunes has attracted its fair share of criticism over the years for being bloated software, so its split into dedicated Music, TV, and Podcasts apps will be much welcomed. Earlier this week, leaked screenshots provided us with our first glimpse at what the Music and TV apps should look like on macOS 10.15.\nApple is widely expected to announce iOS 13, macOS 10.15, watchOS 6, and tvOS 13 at its WWDC 2019 opening keynote on Monday at 10 a.m. Pacific Time. MacRumors will have live coverage of the event on our website and through MacRumorsLive on Twitter, so be sure to follow along for the latest updates.",

But, without proper protections in place, those same people may abuse it to spy on users' private information or profiles.\nOne of the internal tools that can access user data is called SnapLion, according to multiple sources and the emails. The tool was originally used to gather information on users in response to valid law enforcement requests, such as a court order or subpoena, two former employees said. Both of the sources said SnapLion is a play on words with the common acronym for law enforcement officer LEO, with one of them adding it is a reference to the cartoon character Leo the Lion. Snap's \"Spam and Abuse\" team has access, according to one of the former employees, and a current employee suggested the tool is used to combat bullying or harassment on the platform by other users.

        "title": "Minecraft Earth for iOS goes a step beyond Pok\u00e9mon Go",
        "body": "Alex Kipman, Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens and Kinect creator, is always enthusiastic about the future of computing. As he stands in front of me inside a Minecraft-themed conference room on Microsoft\u2019s campus in Redmond, Washington, I\u2019m immediately drawn to the stacks of Lego blocks on the table beside him. Lego is the perfect analogy for Minecraft. For a decade, it\u2019s been a game that millions use to build their own creations out of virtual blocks of materials. Minecraft employees use Lego blocks to build miniature buildings during meetings, but over the past 12 months, they\u2019ve been adventuring outside to secretly test a new way to play Minecraft.\nIn the same building where Microsoft is creating the next Halo game, a team of engineers and game designers have been dreaming up the future of Minecraft on mobile phones with the help of the HoloLens team. Minecraft Earth is a new free-to-play game for iOS and Android that\u2019s surprisingly ambitious for Microsoft. We\u2019ve already seen holograms through Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens headset, but the company now wants to bring this technology to a much broader scale with the help of Minecraft Earth.\nPok\u00e9mon Go saw 20 million people searching for pok\u00e9mon in streets worldwide back in 2016, thanks to augmented reality. Minecraft has 91 million active players, and now Microsoft wants to take the Pok\u00e9mon Go concept a big step further by letting Minecraft players create and share whatever they\u2019ve made in the game with friends in the real world, away from TV screens and monitors.\n\u201dMinecraft Earth proposes to completely break the dogma that has lived with us in computing since the beginning: this idea of a single person that holds a single device to create a single experience,\u201d says Kipman. \u201cWith Minecraft Earth, that\u2019s no longer the case. The content is in the real world.\u201d\nImagine sitting at home and building something in Minecraft on your phone and then dropping it into your local park for all of your friends to see it together at the same exact location. Minecraft Earth aims to transform AR gaming from single-person experiences into a living, breathing virtual world that\u2019s shared by everyone. If Microsoft succeeds, you\u2019ll be able to walk into a mall and point your phone\u2019s camera at a McDonald\u2019s Minecraft adventure while you\u2019re eating a Big Mac or see your own giant structures next to actual buildings.\nMicrosoft is being hugely ambitious with \u2018Minecraft Earth\u2019\nThis hugely ambitious project starts with some basics in the form of Minecraft Earth. The game will be available in beta on iOS and Android this summer, and I got to try various forms of it at Microsoft\u2019s campus a couple of weeks ago. It\u2019s fair to say the game I played was basic, occasionally buggy, but very impressive. While the regular version of Minecraft lets players play in modes like creative (with unlimited blocks and items) or survival (if you die you lose your items), Microsoft is blending these traditional modes into a new way to play Minecraft.\n\u201cThis is an adaptation, this is not a direct translation of Minecraft,\u201d explains Torfi Olafsson, game director of Minecraft Earth. While it\u2019s an adaptation, it\u2019s built on the existing Bedrock engine so it will be very familiar to existing Minecraft players. \u201cIf you like building Redstone machines, or you\u2019re used to how the water flows, or how sand falls down, it all works,\u201d says Olafsson. All of the mobs of animals and creatures in Minecraft are available, too, including a new pig that really loves mud. \u201cWe have tried to stay very true to the kind of core design pillars of Minecraft, and we\u2019ve worked with the design team in Stockholm to make sure that the spirit of the game is carried through,\u201d says Olafsson.\nJust like Pok\u00e9mon Go, you\u2019ll need to venture out into the real world to collect things. Instead of pok\u00e9stops, Minecraft Earth has \u201ctapables\u201d that are randomly placed in the world around you. There are always two nearby, and you can walk to get more. These are designed to give you small rewards that allow you to build things, and you\u2019ll want to collect as many of these as possible to get resources and items to build vast structures in the building mode.\n\u201cWe have covered the entire planet in Minecraft,\u201d explains Olafsson. \u201cEvery lake is a place you can fish, every park is a place you can chop down trees. We\u2019ve actually taken maps of the entire world and converted them to Minecraft.\u201d\nThese maps, based on OpenStreetMap, have allowed Microsoft to start working out where to place Minecraft adventures into the world. These adventures spawn dynamically on the Minecraft Earth map and are designed for multiple people to get involved in. This is really where Minecraft Earth starts to get interesting and beyond anything I\u2019ve played in other AR games like Pok\u00e9mon Go. I tried a variety of adventures during my brief Minecraft Earth gameplay demo, and they range from peaceful and friendly to a little more risky, knowing you enter them and might lose all your treasure if you die to a monster.\nThe fascinating part of adventures is that you can be side-by-side with friends, all experiencing the same game on the exact same spot of a sidewalk or in a park at the same time. Microsoft is doing some impressive behind-the-scenes computational magic (more on that later) so that when you play an adventure, it\u2019s in a precise location, beyond regular GPS coordinates, so that everyone is experiencing the same thing. You can fight monsters, break down structures for resources together, and even stand in front of a friend to block them from physically killing a virtual sheep.\nAll of the blocks that are collected during an adventure are shared with fellow players, so there are no player-versus-player battles here to kill each other and steal materials. You\u2019ll even see the tools that fellow players have in their hands on your phone\u2019s screen, alongside their username. The idea is that you essentially become your phone in Minecraft Earth, and your camera is a lens into this virtual world.\n\u2018Minecraft Earth\u2019 lets you play with friends at the same spot at the same time\nOnce you\u2019ve gathered lots of resources, you can then start building. Every player will have a library of build plates, with some that are as big as 200 x 200 feet. You can use build plates to sit a Minecraft build down on a table and build something with friends. Every piece of material that a friend uses on your own plate will then be part of your build, so it\u2019s a collaborative effort to create giant structures; playing solo will mean a lot of searching around for materials.\nI sat for around 10 minutes creating a Minecraft build where I could see blocks flying onto the stcture from someone next to me. They could also see everything I was doing in real time, and we could build together block by block. I could, if I wanted to, also steal my friend\u2019s blocks here to create my own mega building. That introduces an interesting social dynamic because, unlike most games, you\u2019ll be physically next to the person you\u2019re stealing from in the virtual world. \u201cIn order to steal, you would have to look up and go, \u2018Hmm, I\u2019m going to take your blocks,\u2019\u201d says Saxs Persson, creative director of Minecraft. \u201cShenanigans will come from when people have different opinions about what needs to happen, or they band together and do something meaningful.\u201d\nOnce you\u2019ve completed a build, you can then share a link to it for friends or followers to then play with your creation on a table or in giant scale in an open space. You\u2019ll only be able to share a temporary copy of your build to friends, though. They can burn it down and massacre your animals, but it won\u2019t get saved. Because every block, every animal, and every item came from somewhere, it\u2019s a chance for Minecraft Earth players to show off how many hours they\u2019ve put into the game. \u201cThis allows people to build something pretty and share it with their friends,\u201d explains Olafsson. \u201cIt allows you to be inspired by other people\u2019s craftsmanship.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also progression in Minecraft Earth with levels and experience points that are similar to a traditional role-playing game, rather than the classic Minecraft experience. Your character never gets reset, and you always have your same materials in a world that everyone participates in. \u201cWe think it\u2019s important to kind of reward and recognize your progression,\u201d says Olafsson. \u201cWe have levels that unlock content, and as you go up in levels, you\u2019ll get access to more and more content and more build plates.\u201d You\u2019ll also start to earn Rubies, the in-game currency for Minecraft Earth that will let you buy things like build plates, potions, and more content.\nOne of the key parts of Minecraft Earth is having multiple people interact with adventures in a specific location in real time. This is actually a very difficult problem to solve with augmented reality, and it\u2019s thanks to recent progressions in mobile technology that have allowed Microsoft to even try to tackle this. Eventually, Microsoft wants these to persist as \u201cholograms\u201d in the environment around us with exact precision. The problem is our phone cameras aren\u2019t very intelligent. You can use GPS, Wi-Fi fingerprinting, and AR to determine a location, but you need computer vision algorithms to really work out where to place a virtual object that everyone is going to interact with.\nMicrosoft is using its new Azure Spatial Anchors technology in Minecraft Earth. It uses machine vision algorithms so that real-world objects can be used as anchors for digital content. These holograms, as Microsoft calls them, always stay in the same spot. Apple and Google are also working on ways to let multiple devices see and interact with the same virtual object in AR, but Microsoft is trying to create the infrastcture and tools to let developers use this across iOS and Android. This is the secret sauce of Minecraft Earth, if you will.\n\u201cWe rely on people going out and, essentially, not scanning the world, but seeing the world for us and then making that common play space,\u201d explains Persson. This means that Minecraft Earth players are going to help inform where adventures should be placed. They\u2019ll also contribute to making Microsoft\u2019s Azure Spatial Anchors technology more powerful, simply by pointing their cameras at the environment around them. There are obviously privacy implications here, and Microsoft says all data and images will be anonymized so that the algorithms are only detecting feature points around you. Without this machine vision, Microsoft wouldn\u2019t be able to be so ambitious with Minecraft Earth.\nMicrosoft used its HoloLens tech to bring \u2018Minecraft Earth\u2019 to life\n\u201cTo do this, we had to take some of the HoloLens algorithms for capturing images on device and turn them into a point cloud that we can share,\u201d says Jason Cahill, an engineering architect for Minecraft. This allows Microsoft to locate every player in the game and precisely know where they are standing and where to place an adventure for everyone to interact with. Adventures will start off conservatively, and players will walk up to the rough area that Microsoft has designated a place to play. These will mainly be placed nearby where people are often collecting the tapables, and it will be up to the first few players in that area to decide exactly where an adventure gets placed. Once it\u2019s been placed enough times in a safe area, it will persist for new players to simply walk up and start interacting with the adventure.\nMicrosoft is also being very careful about where these adventures are placed. Pok\u00e9mon Go developer Niantic had to settle a lawsuit recently with angry homeowners who had pok\u00e9stops placed near their houses, and there are many challenges regarding blending augmented reality with private spaces. \u201cThis being Microsoft, we have an army of people that figure these things out for what\u2019s a good place to play,\u201d explains Persson. \u201cAnd how do we help people that say, \u2018No, that\u2019s not for me. I don\u2019t want it at my house or by my shop.\u2019\u201d\nPersistent holograms are obviously the end goal for Minecraft Earth, and it\u2019s easy to imagine a future where players can drop these wherever they want once they\u2019ve been approved. This user-generated content always comes with a mountain of risks, though. Whether that\u2019s people building virtual penises or houses with swastikas, there\u2019s always going to be people who would love to in the fun.\n\u201cThere are lots of very real challenges around user-generated content,\u201d says Persson. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated problem at the scale we\u2019re talking about, but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t tackle it.\u201d Microsoft is starting carefully at first without user-generated content being freely placed into the world, and then it plans to figure out how to get this content into Minecraft Earth in the future. \u201cOur vision is that, over time, the collection, the building, the playing, the adventuring will lead to things that people demand they have a place to display,\u201d says Persson. \u201cI think we\u2019ve definitely taken the right steps to get started on that journey. And then we\u2019ll see how quickly we can find the right way for more people to see what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\nThere are clearly a lot of challenges to overcome for Minecraft Earth to work flawlessly, and Microsoft is certainly being ambitious here. From the demos I played, there\u2019s a lot of potential for this to be a te killer AR app. It\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve experienced in AR before, but at times, the demos did feel a little chaotic with multiple people involved in adventures and building structures. I think the core game loops will work well with a few people side by side, but scaling that to have 20, 50, or even hundreds of people interacting with a holographic Minecraft adventure will be very challenging.\nThis game could help Azure and HoloLens in the future\nThat challenge will feed into Microsoft\u2019s broader ambitions with HoloLens and augmented reality, in general. Microsoft sees devices like the HoloLens as the \u201cthird wave of computing,\u201d but the company needs the scale of mobile to really understand the world and improve HoloLens and its own cloud offerings. I think Minecraft Earth is fundamental to helping improve Azure Spatial Anchors, HoloLens, and most of Microsoft\u2019s cloud offerings. The learnings from this game could ultimately help improve the services, software, and even hardware that Microsoft offers to commercial customers.\n\u201cI think the partnership will improve our overall product,\u201d admits Neena Kamath, product lead for Azure Mixed Reality at Microsoft. \u201cWe discover so much\u2026 understanding how users interact with their world, and what the design points are. It\u2019s a great partnership.\u201d Microsoft has used the research and technology it built for HoloLens, and it\u2019s now bringing it to iOS and Android devices with the help of ARKit from Apple and ARCore from Google. Now, the real-world data from these devices that everyone has in their pockets will feed back. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful loop,\u201d as Kamath puts it. Minecraft Earth won\u2019t be launching on HoloLens anytime soon, though, despite Microsoft teasing it at E3 a few years ago.\nMicrosoft now plans to let Minecraft players access Minecraft Earth for a closed beta this summer. It\u2019s not clear how many will be able to access the beta, or whether it will be restricted to the US initially. It\u2019s early days for Minecraft Earth, and Microsoft doesn\u2019t have all of the answers to many questions figured out just yet. Even monetization isn\u2019t finalized. \u201cWe have a fortunate position that Minecraft in and of itself is doing fine from a financial point of view, which allows us to not have to focus too much on what happens with Minecraft Earth,\u201d says Matt Booty, Xbox Game Studios head. \u201cI have total confidence that the team will figure out what the right monetization is for the game.\u201d\nI did spot a marketplace section in Minecraft Earth, but it wasn\u2019t ready or populated, so monetization is very much a work in progress. Microsoft did hint that build plates could be sold, though, and it\u2019s easy to imagine that you\u2019ll be able to buy a bunch of Rubies to get more gear. Microsoft says it, understandably, won\u2019t be using loot boxes, though.\nNo loot boxes for \u2018Minecraft Earth\u2019\nIt\u2019s also reasonable to assume that we might even see Microsoft appear onstage at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) next month. While Microsoft is promising Android and iOS support, I only got to experience the game on Apple\u2019s latest iPhone XS handsets during my brief hands-on time. Minecraft Earth is the best demonstration of augmented reality on an iPhone that I\u2019ve ever seen, and Apple showcased Lego structures during last year\u2019s demonstration of multiplayer mode for AR games.\nFor now, though, all we have is demos, and Microsoft wouldn\u2019t let me take photos or video or any of the gameplay. The company is being unusually hesitant, most likely because early versions of the game are a little buggy. Aside from the summer beta, the company isn\u2019t committing to a full launch date or plan for Minecraft Earth. I think that\u2019s largely because the Minecraft team is still figuring out a lot of the tech and design decisions.",

        "body": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\nAs a company, Apple is less focused on selling stuff. It doesn\u2019t sell as many iPhones as it once did and is more focused on selling subscriptions and services, none of which require a store for purchases or even consideration. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight This is why it is striking that, under chief executive Tim Cook, the company has made it a priority to open a flagship store next week in Washington. Why spend two years and probably more than $30 million renovating the 116-year-old Carnegie Library into an Apple Store?\n\u201cProbably one of the least done things in an Apple Store is to buy something,\u201d Cook said recently by phone. Instead, he said, people come to explore new products, of course, but also get training and services for iPhones or iPads they already own.\n\u201cWe should probably come up with a name other than \u2018store,\u2019 \u201d he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s more of a place for the community to use in a much broader way.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHow true that is may determine the success of Apple\u2019s new landmark in Washington, as well as its future as a retailer. The Carnegie Library store, opening Saturday May 11, will be one of 13 high-profile locations across the world that also utilize the company\u2019s \u201ctown square\u201d concept. Each local staff offers a bevy of classes for creative types to maximize their Apple products for shooting photographs, editing video or producing music.\nApple still sold a few iPhones last year (218 million), but sales fell 17 percent last quarter. Six weeks ago, Cook took the stage at the Steve Jobs Theater in the company\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters and announced an array of new services \u2014 television, news, gaming, credit cards \u2014 that represent the company\u2019s future.\nSo why invest so much time and money to turn the Carnegie Library, which is set in the middle of Mount Vernon Square, into a showcase for its wares?\nAdvertisement\nThe location, christened by President Theodore Roosevelt and Andrew Carnegie at a grand opening celebration in 1903, is one of the city\u2019s most historically significant buildings. Carnegie donated the library\u2019s $350,000 construction cost, which is a little more than $10 million in today\u2019s dollars.\nThat pales in comparison, however, to what it appears Apple paid to restore the Beaux-Arts-style building.\nCook\u2019s team declined to share details of how much the company spent on the project, but preliminary budget details shared with The Washington Post called for more than $30 million of work, including $7 million toward facade restoration, $300,000 to restore the stairwells and $2 million in site work and landscaping. On top of that, Apple agreed to lease the building \u2014 which has been nearly vacant for years \u2014 for $700,000 a year on a 10-year lease.\nAdvertisement\nCook said that reconstituting the Carnegie Library according to its original design standards was the company\u2019s \u201cmost historic, ambitious restoration by far, in the world.\u201d This from a company that has retrofitted stores in New York\u2019s Grand Central Terminal and a 130-year-old former bank in Paris.\nHe said such signature projects will help the company showcase its new services through classes and programming the company calls Today at Apple.\nBut the Carnegie project is also aimed at achieving a higher purpose at the company, which is to deepen customers\u2019 affiliation of Apple with something positive \u2014 creativity \u2014 at a time when the public finds itself increasingly at odds with big-tech companies over jagged political issues surrounding economic inequality, social media and privacy.\nSteve Jobs famously loved calligraphy and launched the Think Different advertising campaign during a time when adoring a tech company seemed far more innocent.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cOur roots are in education and creativity,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou think about where the company started from and Steve and the team at the time were very focused on providing people tools that allowed them to do incredible things.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been serving the creative community as a company since the founding of the company, and the truth is everyone should be a part of the creative community,\u201d Cook added, \u201cso this is our way to democratize it.\u201d\nOn a recent Friday afternoon in Apple\u2019s store in Georgetown, dozens of people lined up at the Genius Bar service station for help with fixing cracked screens, rebooting computers and updating iPads.\nAt a set of wooden tables in the back, away from the products, the store showcased a slate of creative programs, including a tutorial on family portraits that a father and son enjoyed midday.\nAdvertisement\nBut no one at the Georgetown location would confuse the store\u2019s purpose: devices. How to fix them, upgrade them, buy accessories for them.\nDeirdre O\u2019Brien, the new head of Apple retail, said the arts programming isn\u2019t envisioned as a way to drive sales.\n\u201cWe created Today at Apple to take our customers further, deepen their relationship with their product,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily create it with the idea of driving more revenue. It\u2019s part of the experience of visiting our store.\u201d\nWill Cook and O\u2019Brien succeed in persuading people to view the new store as something more than a store? Although it is built in a former public library, the city\u2019s downtown library is a few blocks away. The Apple logo will glow on the side of the building the way it does on the back of an Apple laptop.\nOn the other hand, the store at the Carnegie Library will hardly resemble the Georgetown location.\nAdvertisement\nVisitors (customers?) will enter through pristinely restored marble entryways to a naturally lit central events area that the company says is open to whoever wanders in. No sales pitch. No questions asked. Devices and services will be tucked into side rooms.\nThe nonprofit Historical Society of Washington, D.C., which will share the building with Apple rent-free, will also enjoy a completely upgraded space where it will open a new D.C. History Center. The organization is planning to launch a retrospective on 20th-century Washington through panoramic photographs.\nApple has planned six weeks of programs headed by local artists that begin May 18. The programs include a performance by D.C. rapper GoldLink and a party hosted by local arts group No Kings Collective.\n\u201cIt's a great sort of intersection \u2014 technology with humanities,\u201d said John Suau, the Historical Society\u2019s executive director. \u201cHopefully, it makes people feel like they have a sense of place here.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nCity officials, including Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D), are celebrating the Apple project. For all its history and beauty, the Carnegie Library hasn\u2019t been fully utilized in more than 15 years, despite repeated failed attempts.\nThe city provided the building to the Historical Society on a 99-year, no-cost lease in 1999. After raising $20 million, the group opened a museum dedicated to D.C. history there, but it lasted less than two years. Another group planned a music museum, which never even opened.\nMost recently, the International Spy Museum\u2019s owners proposed a major expansion and overhaul of the building for their museum\u2019s new home. The D.C. panel tasked with protecting historical buildings turned down that plan three times before the effort fell apart.\nThe building remains isolated in an island surrounded by busy lanes of traffic, a good distance from other shopping. But new office buildings, hotels and restaurants have opened around it in recent years.\nAdvertisement\nBowser visited one of the company\u2019s other signature stores last year during a visit to Silicon Valley and said she came away impressed at how open the space was to the public and the activity it generated around it.\n\u201cWe were very careful about making sure that we brought back the historical society space and the very significant public benefit restoration of the Carnegie Library,\u201d she said.\nNot everyone is thrilled that a $900 billion company seems to be further encroaching on what used to be largely public places and ideas.\n\u201cI think this says so much about the corporate seizure of America as we know it,\u201d said Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, executive director of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund, an advocacy group. \u201cWhen we think about the town square concept, it\u2019s in this cherished view of a place as a core element of a Democratic society. Apple\u2019s \u2018town squares\u2019 are not going to be that. They\u2019re going to be sanitized places for people to gather within the confines of commercialism.\u201d\nPerhaps it will end up somewhere in between. O\u2019Brien, who has been with the company more than 30 years, was part of the team that dreamed up the first Apple store, which opened in 2001.\n\u201cIt was a major shift for Apple, and we\u2019re very thoughtful about how to do it in a way that will be successful,\u201d she said. Despite all that has changed since then, she thinks the retail locations still stand for the same thing: \u201cWhat you see is the Apple logo. That\u2019s what you get. You get Apple.\u201d\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

        "body": "TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is out today with a new report on Apple\u2019s supply chain as it pertains to the 2019 and 2020 iPhones. According to Kuo, the 2019 iPhones will feature \u201cvast changes\u201d in antenna structures due to a shift in suppliers and technology.\nKuo explains that the 2019 iPhones will use a new modified-PI antenna structure, a claim he first made in November of 2018, but is now doubling down on. The analyst explains that the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR are limited by their liquid crystal polymer (LCP) antenna technology. Kuo says production issues around LCP cause problems for high-frequency cellular transmission.\nMeanwhile, the switch to modified-PI antenna structure in the 2019 iPhones will bring both cost and production improvements for Apple. For consumers, it offers performance that is essentially the same as LCP when it comes to 4G LTE.\nIn total, however, Kuo explains that the cost of the antenna technology in the 2019 iPhones will be up 10-20 percent year-over-year due to new ultra-wideband upgrades. This will improve the iPhone\u2019s performance when it comes to indoor navigation. Kuo first mentioned this upgrade in February.\nKuo also says that Apple supplier Career will lose orders for the iPhone this year. This could explain why earlier this year, Career was accused of forcing 200 Apple supplier employees to \u201cvoluntarily resign.\u201d Kuo further notes that Career won\u2019t receive any new orders from Apple in 2019 for iPad and Apple Watch production, either.\nLastly, Kuo notes that iPhone shipments in the second half of 2019 will be flat year-over-year. He also reiterates that the 2020 iPhones will adopt 5G technology, and switch back to the aforementioned LCP antenna tech. Last month, Kuo predicted that the 2020 iPhones will use modems from Samsung and Qualcomm, and said the switch to 5G could help Apple drive 200 million iPhone shipments in 2020.\nRead more:\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "body": "iPhone and iPad currently support multiroom audio to AirPlay 2 speakers. A new report from Macotakara says that Apple is adding dual Bluetooth audio support for the next iPhone.\nDual Bluetooth output could potentially enable two people to listen to music from the same phone, connecting two sets of AirPods simultaneously.\nCurrently, the iPhone software only supports connecting to one audio profile device at a time.\nYou can be paired to multiple headphones but the sound can only ever come out of one set. The iPhone supports multiple connections of different types already; for example, it is possible to be connected to headphones and the Apple Watch simultaneously.\nDual Bluetooth Audio is already supported by some Android devices.\nThe example use case that Macotakara quotes in its story is that an iPhone could be connected to a car and wireless earphones, sending navigation speech utterances to the car speakers whilst also sending music to their headphones.\nAs seen from existing implementations on Samsung phones, dual Bluetooth audio modes can suffer from synchronization issues so it probably isn\u2019t going to be useful to output to a multi-room setup.\nDual Bluetooth Audio could be a cool way for you and a friend to listen to the same thing together, pairing two sets of AirPods at once.\nApple is also expected to be adding bilateral wireless charging to the iPhone 11. This would enable users to quickly charge their AirPods by simply placing the case on the back of their phone, sharing the power from the iPhone\u2019s battery.\nThe new iPhone lineup is expected to be announced in the fall, probably at a September media event. Dual Bluetooth Audio is part of the Bluetooth 5 specification, although it\u2019s not clear if the Bluetooth 5 radios present in the iPhone since 2017 can support it.
