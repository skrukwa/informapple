        "title": "Apple exec met with teenager who found FaceTime bug at his Arizona home, will be eligible for bug bounty program",
        "body": "Feb. 4th 2019 7:14 am\nThe FaceTime bug that made waves as result of 9to5Mac\u2019s coverage last week was actually first reported to Apple by Grant Thompson and his mother in Arizona a week earlier. However, deficiencies in the Apple bug reporting process meant that the report was not acted upon by the company \u2026\nInstead, the teenager made headlines when his mother shared their Apple communications on Twitter. Their claims were later proved to be legitimate.\nAround January 22, Apple Support directed them to file a Radar bug report, which meant the mother had to first register a developer account as an ordinary customer. Even after following the indicated steps, it does not appear that Apple\u2019s product or engineering teams were aware of the problem until its viral explosion a week later.\nApple took down the Group FaceTime servers to prevent the bug from happening as a short-term workaround, a few hours after the bug was publicized by 9to5Mac. Customers are still waiting for an iOS software update to restore Group FaceTime.\nCNBC reports that an unnamed \u201chigh-level Apple executive\u201d met with the Thompsons at their home in Tucson, Arizona on Friday. They apparently discussed how Apple could improve its bug reporting process and indicated that Grant would be eligible for the Apple bug bounty program.\n\u201cThey also indicated that Grant would be eligible for the bug bounty program. And we would hear from their security team the following week in terms of what that meant,\u201d said Michele Thompson. \u201cIf he got some kind of bug bounty for what he found we\u2019d certainly put it to good use for his college because I think he\u2019s going to go far, hopefully. This is actually a field he was interested in before and even more so now.\u201d\nApple\u2019s bug bounty system is typically invite-only and limited to specific categories of security flaws, like accessing iCloud account data or demonstrating ways for iPhone apps to escape the security sandbox of iOS. Monetary rewards are not given out to any random individual who happens to find a bug in Apple software.\nTherefore, Thompson\u2019s finding of a glitch in iOS that could cause people to hear the caller\u2019s microphone without their knowledge, would not qualify according to those rules.\nIt appears the company is making an exception here given the embarrassingly public nature of the case, although further details about the reward have yet to be discussed.\nUnder the official bug bounty program, Apple pays between $25,000 and $200,000 depending on the severity of the exploit.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "Huawei cloning Apple parts, rewarding employees for tech theft",
        "body": "Article Hero Image\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nChina's Huawei uses \"dubious\" tactics to try to reverse engineer technology from Apple and other competitors in the electronics market, a report charged on Monday.\nIn November, for example, a Huawei engineer heading up smartwatch development tracked down a supplier that helps build the Apple Watch's heart rate sensor, The Information said. The person arranged a meeting with the claim he could offer a manufacturing contract, but instead probed for details about the Apple Watch, an anonymous executive at the supplier said.\nThe engineer was accompanied by four researchers, and together the group is said to have spent an hour and a half asking about the Watch. With nothing given Huawei went silent.\nHuawei has reportedly used similar tactics against companies like Cisco, Motorola, and Akhan Semiconductor. The U.S. Justice Department in fact claims that Huawei has a program that rewards employees for stealing data, with better bonuses based on how confidential information is.\nAn earlier Apple-related incident, according to one source, involved Huawei copying a 2016 connector design used to make the MacBook Pro hinge thinner while linking the display to the logic board. A similar component then appeared in Huawei's 2018 MateBook Pro, something achieved by shopping Apple's schematic around to various suppliers \u2014 most of which recognized the design and refused to build it. Eventually the company found a willing partner.\nAnother alleged tactic is talking to people who formerly worked with Apple or its supply chain. In one case, a person interviewed with Huawei immediately after leaving Apple, only to be repeatedly asked about upcoming products and features. They refused and stopped taking interviews.\n\"It was clear they were more interested in trying to learn about Apple than they were in hiring me,\" the person explained.\nHuawei has become the center of a maelstrom surrounding the Chinese government's business policies. The company is believed to have government ties, which has led to calls in the U.S. and elsewhere to ban it from supplying 5G infrastructure. Chinese operatives have regularly conducted cyber attacks in the U.S.\nHuawei and its CFO, Wanzhou Meng, were recently hit with a barrage of U.S. charges accusing it of bank fraud, wire fraud, violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Theft of trade secrets is another item on the docket, though mostly because of a 2013 incident related to a T-Mobile phone-testing robot.",

        "body": "Of all the widely ridiculed tech products, Apple\u2019s AirPods have experienced an extraordinary turnaround. Back in 2016, they were roundly mocked by the tech industry. Tiny wireless earbuds? It seemed like a recipe for disaster \u2013 streets would be littered with these lost headphones, which would clutter up city pavements like discarded gloves and babies\u2019 socks.\n\u201cIf only there were an invention that could keep those AirPods tethered together, like a string,\u201d wrote Ashley Esqueda from the tech website CNET on Twitter. \u201cThe beauty of the headphone cable is just like the beauty of a tampon string: it is there to help you keep track of a very important item,\u201d wrote Julia Carrie Wong in the Guardian.\nBut fast-forward to 2019 and, somehow, the \u00a3159-a-pair little pods have transformed into a bona fide status symbol. Diana Ross has a pair, Kristen Stewart wears them and a woman in Virginia has even started a cottage industry by turning them into earrings for people (which does solve the problem of inevitably losing them).\nAnd so, the butt of the joke is not the AirPods themselves but the wealth and status of the people who wear them. Such as the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who wore his upside down. As one viral tweet joked, the world\u2019s Top 10 richest people are: 1. AirPod users; 2. The CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos; and 3. Bill Gates. One meme, of a man being knighted by a queen, featured the caption: \u201cAirPod users welcoming new members who received them for Christmas.\u201d All this has now become known as \u201cAirPod flexing\u201d \u2013 with the implication that showing off the headphones is gauche social signalling.\nBut is it fair? \u201cThe thing is, AirPods aren\u2019t even the most expensive wireless headphones out there,\u201d says Katy Leeson, the managing director of the social media marketing agency Social Chain.\nThat said, the jokes about them can\u2019t have hurt Apple \u2013 if anything, the people mocking the product have led to a sales bump. \u201cPeople who consume memes \u2013 millennials and so on \u2013 are really hard to reach through traditional advertising,\u201d one digital marketing executive said. This online chatter creates a \u201cdesirability\u201d all of its own. And, with rumours of AirPods 2 on the way, it seems like the little earbuds are here to stay.",

Williams also took questions from students in the audience. One student asked Williams if Apple had any plans to reduce prices considering the seemingly large margins on Apple products based on analyst reports.\nWilliams dismissed those reports, suggesting the actual cost of development isn't considered:\n\u201cThe stories that come out about the cost of our products [have been] the bane of my existence from the beginning of time, including our early days,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnalysts don\u2019t really understand the cost of what we do and how much care we put into making our products.\u201d\nHe goes on to explain that to build the Apple Watch's activity tracker, Apple built a physiology lab with 40 nurses and 10,000 participants. Still, Williams conceded it's an area that they are paying attention to:\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re very aware of,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not want to be an elitist company.

        "body": "Whilst we have yet to see firm evidence on the design of the 2019 iPhone, there has been back and forth rumors about whether the new iPhone would use Lightning or USB-C.\nJapanese site Macotakara says that not only will the 2019 iPhone use Lightning, Apple will also continue to bundle the same 5W charger and USB-A to Lightning cable in the box. This is seen as a cost saving measure. It seems that customers wanting faster iPhone charge times will still have to buy accessories, like the 12W iPad charger.\nThe site explains that Lightning port is not going anywhere and Apple is resistant to changing the included accessories to maintain production costs. Apple can benefit from huge economies of scale by selling the same accessories for many generation.\nAs such, Apple apparently will keep bundling Lightning EarPods, Lightning to USB-A cable, and the 5W USB power adaptor, with the 2019 iPhone lineup.\nThis is disappointing as Apple began shipping an 18W USB-C charger with its iPad Pro line last fall, and many expected that accessory to become an iPhone standard too. Even if the iPhone keeps the Lightning port, Lightning can support fast-charging over the USB Type-C protocol.\nIt\u2019s not clear if the cost savings of this decision would be passed on to consumers with lower cost 2019 iPhone pricing.\nAs the internal batteries of iPhones get larger, sticking to the same 5W charger means that the majority of iPhone users notice that it takes longer to charge an iPhone to 100%. Many believe it is a hardware defect, that their iPhone is merely charging slowly due to a fault, until the charging situation is explained.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Our App Store Review Guidelines require that apps request explicit user consent and provide a clear visual indication when recording, logging, or otherwise making a record of user activity.\u201d\n\u201cWe have notified the developers that are in violation of these strict privacy terms and guidelines, and will take immediate action if necessary,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nIt follows an investigation by TechCrunch that revealed major companies, like Expedia, Hollister and Hotels.com, were using a third-party analytics tool to record every tap and swipe inside the app. We found that none of the apps we tested asked the user for permission, and none of the companies said in their privacy policies that they were recording a user\u2019s app activity.\nEven though sensitive data is supposed to be masked, some data \u2014 like passport numbers and credit card numbers \u2014 was leaking.\nGlassbox is a cross-platform analytics tool that specializes in session replay technology. It allows companies to integrate its screen recording technology into their apps to replay how a user interacts with the apps. Glassbox says it provides the technology, among many reasons, to help reduce app error rates. But the company \u201cdoesn\u2019t enforce its customers\u201d to mention that they use Glassbox\u2019s screen recording tools in their privacy policies.\nBut Apple expressly forbids apps that covertly collect data without a user\u2019s permission.\nTechCrunch began hearing on Thursday that app developers had already been notified that their apps had fallen afoul of Apple\u2019s rules. One app developer was told by Apple to remove code that recorded app activities, citing the company\u2019s app store guidelines.\n\u201cYour app uses analytics software to collect and send user or device data to a third party without the user\u2019s consent. Apps must request explicit user consent and provide a clear visual indication when recording, logging, or otherwise making a record of user activity,\u201d Apple said in the email.\nApple gave the developer less than a day to remove the code and resubmit their app or the app would be removed from the app store, the email said.\nWhen asked if Glassbox was aware of the app store removals, a spokesperson for Glassbox said that \u201cthe communication with Apple is through our customers.\u201d\nGlassbox is also available to Android app developers. Google did not immediately comment if it would also ban the screen recording code. Google Play also expressly prohibits apps from secretly collecting device usage. \u201cApps must not hide or cloak tracking behavior or attempt to mislead users about such functionality,\u201d the developer rules state. We\u2019ll update if and when we hear back.\nIt\u2019s the latest privacy debacle that has forced Apple to wade in to protect its customers after apps were caught misbehaving.\nLast week, TechCrunch reported that Apple banned Facebook\u2019s \u201cresearch\u201d app that the social media giant paid teenagers to collect all of their data.\nIt followed another investigation by TechCrunch that revealed Facebook misused its Apple-issued enterprise developer certificate to build and provide apps for consumers outside Apple\u2019s App Store.

As a result, biennial upgrades, let alone annual iPhone swaps, became increasingly rare \u2014 demonstrated by ever shrinking Apple Store lines proceeding a new launch. Now, the anecdotal findings are being corroborated by industry analyst Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein, who says that the average iPhone upgrade time has increased to four years, up from three years in fiscal 2018.\nAs the need for a new smartphone each year to offer an enjoyable mobile experience has evaporated, Sacconaghi attributed in a note to investors on Friday that users see less of a need to upgrade as often due to Apple\u2019s battery replacement program and increased prices.\nSacconaghi frames the issue as both critical and underestimated.\nIn our view, the single most important controversy surrounding Apple today is the iPhone replacement cycle \u2013 despite the iPhone installed base growing +9% last year, we now expect units to be down -19% in fiscal 2019, implying a material pushout in upgrade rates. Replacement cycles are elongating\u2026 a lot.\nLater on, he predicts that approximately 16% of the current iPhone base will upgrade this year, meaning that whatever Apple announces come September certainly isn\u2019t expected to drive any sort of otherworldly upgrade rates.\nTim Cook has acknowledged slowing iPhone upgrade rates in the past, saying previously that customers are \u201cholding onto\u201d iPhones a bit longer than before.\nSlowing upgrade times and stagnating smartphone sales is not merely an Apple problem, however. We\u2019ve reported on global shipments falling since last year, as data from IDC shows even Samsung seeing slowing sales.\nAs for AAPL, the stock has rebounded well over the past months, however, it\u2019s down about $5 from earlier this week and still has a long ways to go before reaching $1 trillion once more.\nAAPL again became the worlds most valuable company this week, peaking at $175 per share on Wednesday in the 24 hours following the news.\nDo you believe the average user is upgrading their iPhone every four years now?

Furthermore, once enabled, two-factor authentication \"imposes an extraneous logging in procedure that requires a user to both remember password; and have access to a trusted device or trusted phone number\" when a device is enabled.\nFiling paperwork associated with the suit also alleges that harm is being done, and potential class members \"have been and continue to suffer harm\" including economic losses, based on a waste of personal time for an extended login process that has become a multiple-step process.\nThe filer alleges that a software update enabled two factor authentication on or around September 2015. However, neither macOS El Capitan nor iOS 9 released in the timeframe put forth by the filer mandated two-factor authentication, nor implemented it without an explicit and multiple-step opt-in procedure requiring the user to consent. It is required to take advantage of some of Apple's services, like Home Sharing and HomeKit Hubs, however.\nBrodsky alleges that the email that Apple sends after two-factor authentication is enabled is insufficient to warn the user that the setting is irrevocable. The filing calls a link in an email to a page to reset the configuration \"unobtrusive\" but does not specify what would have been sufficiently noticeable in a three-paragraph email.\nEmail sent to user after two-factor authentication is activated on an iCloud account\nAccording to the suit, when two-factor authentication is demanded, the process as follows takes between two and five minutes.\nFirst, Plaintiff has to enter his selected password on the device he is interested in logging in. Second, Plaintiff has to enter password on another trusted device to login. Third, optionally, Plaintiff has to select a Trust or Don't Trust pop-up message response. Fourth, Plaintiff then has to wait to receive a six-digit verification code on that second device that is sent by an Apple Server on the internet. Finally, Plaintiff has to input the received six-digit verification code on the first device he is trying to log into. Each login process takes an additional estimated 2-5 or more minutes with 2FA.\"\nAppleInsider hasn't been randomly presented with any two-factor authentications on Saturday even following OS updates to an iPhone XS Max, an iPhone X, and two sixth-generation iPads, but was able to force the issue on a new device. The process took 22 seconds in total to accomplish.\nThe filer believes that Apple has interfered with the use of the device with the \"extraneous login process through two-factor authentication\" that has been \"imposed\" on the class. The time it takes to execute the extra login data is said to be \"continuous, systematic and ongoing\" and Apple has \"caused injury to Plaintiff and Class Members' rights to choose the level of security for Plaintiff and Class Member owned devices.\"",

        "body": "Apple has reached a deal with French authorities to pay an undeclared amount of back-dated tax, according to multiple reports today.\nApple's French division confirmed the tax payment agreement to Reuters, but didn't disclose how much it had agreed to pay, although French media suggest the sum is around 500 million euros ($571 million).\n\"As a multinational company, Apple is regularly audited by fiscal authorities around the world,\" Apple France said in a statement. \"The French tax administration recently concluded a multi-year audit on the company's French accounts, and those details will be published in our public accounts.\"\nFrance has been working diligently to stop tech companies like Apple from exploiting tax loopholes in the country. The loopholes are said to have allowed Apple to \"minimize taxes and grab market share\" at the expense of Europe-based companies.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is one of the leaders behind the tax crackdown on international tech companies, with a goal of bringing a more unified corporate tax system across the nineteen euro area states.\nAs noted by iPhon.fr, Apple and French tax authorities reached the agreement for the payment of several years of unpaid taxes in December, according to French newspaper L'Expansion. The agreement followed a meeting in October between Apple CEO Tim Cook and President Macron, in which both reportedly agreed that a solution would ultimately be enacted by the European Union rather than France.\nApple has had trouble with French tax activist groups accusing the company of wide-scale tax evasion and occupying its Parisian retail stores. In February 2018, Apple sued the activist group \"Attac\" for its protests in stores, but the High Court of Paris denied Apple's request for an injunction that would have blocked the group from protesting.",

We thank the Thompson family for reporting the bug. We sincerely apologize to our customers who were affected and all who were concerned about this security issue.

In some cases, even video was accessible.\nWe demonstrated the bug in a video earlier this week:\nApple disabled Group FaceTime as a temporary server-side solution, preventing the bug from working any longer. Apple is also working on a software update with a permanent fix that it originally said would be available this week , but it has been delayed until next week, according to Apple's statement.\nApple thanked the Thompson family for reporting the bug\u2014supposedly over a week before it made headlines\u2014and said it is committed to improving the process by which it receives and escalate these reports in order to quash bugs faster.\nApple already faces a lawsuit in Texas and a proposed class action lawsuit in Canada over the bug.

        "title": "Apple beginning new push for subscription-based apps instead of single purchases",
        "body": "For a while now, Apple has been encouraging app developers to consider subscriptions as a key revenue source, and the company is introducing some new options for developers that it hopes will make the option more attractive. In the past few days, Apple has informed developers that they will now be able to target current and recent subscribers with promotional rates on subscriptions. That means developers will be able to offer discounts to try to get you back if you lapse, or they might try to entice you to stay if you're considering leaving.\nDevelopers could previously offer limited-time subscription discounts but only to new users. The new model is available in recent beta releases of iOS 12.2, macOS Mojave 10.14.4, and tvOS 12.2, and it is likely to be included in the final public release for each. Apple will facilitate three different types of offer for developers who want to retain or regain subscribers.\nHere's how they're described in Apple's App Store Connect post on the subject:\nFree\nCustomers access your subscription for free for a specific duration\u2014for example, a 30-day trial for a subscription with a standard renewal price of $4.99 per month. Pay As You Go\nCustomers pay a promotional price for each billing period for a selected duration\u2014for example, $1.99 per month for three months for a subscription with a standard renewal price of $9.99 per month. Pay Up Front\nCustomers pay a one-time promotional price for a specific duration\u2014for example, $9.99 for the first six months of a subscription with a standard renewal price of $39.99 per year.\nTo deploy these offers, developers will need to implement new StoreKit APIs using the latest beta version of Xcode. They can test using the aforementioned iOS, macOS, and tvOS betas, but the offers will not become available to users until the \"the feature is publicly available.\"\nApple has actually already made similar offers to iPhone users for Apple Music, but this is the first time other developers on Apple's platform can reach lapsed subscribers this way.\nApple specifically positions the feature as one for resubbing lapsed users. The company writes, \"You can use subscription offers to help win back subscribers who have canceled their subscriptions or promote an upgrade to another subscription at a special price.\" Apple also clarifies that users will be able to take advantage of the offers even if they already participated in a similar initial sign-up offer when they first subscribed. Further, developers will be able to target users who have set subscriptions to end at the next pay date to use these offers to convince them to stay.\nAdvertisement\nApple reportedly gathered developers of all types\u2014makers of games, productivity apps, photography apps, and so on\u2014in New York in 2017 to make the case for subscriptions as a viable model, even on mobile.\nSamuel Axon\nSamuel Axon\nSamuel Axon\nSamuel Axon\nSamuel Axon\nGames and high-end productivity and creative work suites have long used the model on PCs, but it was previously somewhat rare on mobile. Anyone using new iOS apps regularly has probably seen that change. Games that rely on IAP now frequently offer optional subscriptions that allow players to progress faster or get discounts on other purchases. Photography apps charge a couple of dollars per month for access to powerful, AI-driven filters. And powerful productivity apps offer subscriptions not dissimilar to\u2014though usually cheaper than\u2014Adobe Creative Cloud and the like. In most cases, developers have chosen to make the subscriptions value-added rather than essential for basic function. But not always.\nApple takes a 30-percent cut of subscription revenues from apps in the App Store for the first year a subscriber is paying, but it drops the cut to 15 percent after the subscriber has passed the one-year mark. This drop is partly an effort to reward developers who produce apps of sufficient quality to entice subscribers to stay that long, but it's also a response to initial complaints that the terms were burdensome.\nThe subscriptions model is part of a larger strategic push at Apple to pivot to monetizing content, services, and experiences on its platforms in addition to revenue from hardware sales. This push is itself partly in response to and in anticipation of iPhone sales lulling slightly internationally and partly in response to the success that was the 2015 launch of Apple Music.\nListing image by Valentina Palladino",

        "title": "Touch ID that spans the entire iPhone display in the works at Apple",
        "body": "Article Hero Image\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nWhile Touch ID isn't being offered as a biometric authentication method in current-generation iPhones and the iPad Pro range, Apple is still considering the possibility of adding fingerprint recognition to its mobile devices, by using acoustic imaging on the display.\nFace ID has been a successful replacement for Touch ID, boasting fewer false positives than the more physical biometric security system while still remaining fast to use. While it has brought some benefits, there are still some advantages to using Touch ID over Face ID, such as in situations where it isn't prudent to use Face ID or to unlock the iPhone while it is still in the user's pocket.\nEven so, Touch ID has the major problem of requiring either a section of the front of the mobile device to be used for the fingerprint reader, reducing the potential screen size, or for it to be mounted on the back, a design choice Apple has yet to take. Based on a recently-granted patent, Apple has come up with a way to do Touch ID-style fingerprint reading, but without sacrificing the appearance of the iPhone itself.\nThe patent titled \"Acoustic pulse coding for imaging of input devices,\" describes how sound could be applied to a surface in order to detect how another object comes into contact with it. In short, this could enable a fingerprint to be read when it is pressed onto a display.\nAn illustration using two rows of transducers at the top and bottom of the display\nAccording to the patent, an array of acoustic transducers are positioned in contact with the surface, and can transmit a coded impulse signal, in response to a touch input. By monitoring the reflections from multiple coded signals, an image resolver can receive the reflection data and generate an image based on the input.\nIn effect, sound impulses are sent out and come into contact with the ridges of the user's fingerprint. These ridges interrupt the impulse's transit and are reflected, with these reflections then interpreted into a fingerprint image that can be analyzed.\nSuch a technique would provide a number of benefits compared to existing fingerprint reading technology, including a reduced thickness of the components required as the transducers can be placed on the edge and away from other components. There is also a lack of a need for electrodes to be placed on the display, which aside from reducing the complexity of display production, also means a potential speed boost for performing the authentication check in the first place, due to Apple suggesting it requires less processing power.\nAs it is based on sound transmittance, it could also feasibly allow for fingerprint reading to be performed anywhere on the display of the device, not just one specific point.\nOne version involves transducers surrounding the entire display area, potentially allowing for a more accurate scan by pinging from multiple sides.\nApple files numerous patents on a weekly basis, and while they do advise on areas of interest for the company, it doesn't necessarily mean the ideas disclosed will appear in a future product or service.\nThis is not the only time Apple has looked at alternative ways to perform fingerprint-based biometrics via the display, without using a designated sensor like Touch ID's Home button. In February 2017, a filing for an \"Acoustic imaging system architecture\" suggested a similar method of using acoustic pulses and waves from transducers to perform similar reflection-based analysis of objects in contact with the surface.",

        "body": "Siri has gotten its fair share of scrutiny over the years, with many believing it\u2019s falling behind in the smart assistant game despite being the first major company to market with the technology. Bill Stasior, who was responsible for Siri over the last seven years, has recently left the company.\nAccording to a report from The Information, Stasior joined the Siri team in 2012, focusing on leading the group. This was after two of Siri\u2019s creators had left the team, however, they remained at Apple working on other projects.\nStasior leaving the company is likely an effort by John Giannandrea, who is now Apple\u2019s SVP of machine learning and AI strategy, after leaving Google earlier last year.\nThe report also says that Giannandrea\u2019s team is now focusing on long-term research versus the short-term incremental updates Siri has been seeing over the past several years. He\u2019s still looking for someone to lead the Siri team, however.\nWith the new focus on long-term research, it\u2019s highly unlikely that we\u2019ll see any major improvement in Siri this year with iOS 13, if any at all. However, under Giannandrea\u2019s leadership, Siri may finally be getting the help it needs to become a great voice assistant, even if that means waiting another year to see improvements.\nRelated stories:\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "body": "A new report on Wednesday claims a number of publications have signed with Apple for their Apple News-based subscription news service, in spite of the 50/50 revenue split Apple is requiring.\nApple is reportedly aiming to keep half of all revenue received by publications selling subscriptions on the Cupertino firm\u2019s rumored premium new service. While some industry analysts have bashed Apple over the 50/50 split required by the deal, it appears many publications see value in the deal.\nA Wednesday report from Recode says \u201cmany\u201d publishers have already signed deals to be included in the much-rumored news subscription service. The publishers see potential for growth by partnering with the iPhone maker.\nHere\u2019s the short answer, which I\u2019ve cobbled together by talking to industry sources: Apple has already signed many publishers to deals where they\u2019ll get 50 percent of the revenue Apple generates through subscriptions to its news service, which is currently called Texture and will be relaunched as a premium version of Apple News this spring. And some publishers are happy to do it, because they think Apple will sign up many millions of people to the new service. And they\u2019d rather have a smaller percentage of a bigger number than a bigger chunk of a smaller number.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the absolute dollars paid out that matters, not the percentage,\u201d said one unidentified publishing executive.\nWhile smaller publishers may be willing to share their revenue with Apple on such a dear scale, larger publishers continue to balk at signing for such a revenue split.\nThe New York Times and the Washington Post are two of the publishers that haven\u2019t yet inked a deal with Apple for the service. Both publications have site paywalls and subscription offerings in place already. While The Wall Street Journal is also said to have similar concerns, its conversations with Apple have been described as \u201cproductive.\u201d\nThe publications\u2019 share of the $10 monthly fee paid to Apple would be much less than the fees the publications currently pay. The New York Times charges $15 per month, while The Washington Post\u2019s tariff is $10 per month and The Wall Street Journal asks a hefty $39 per month.\nIt is feared current subscribers would cancel their direct subscriptions and they would switch over to the Cupertino firm\u2019s much cheaper alternative. All three sites currently offer some of their content via the Apple News app, and offer subscriptions through the service, keeping 70% of subscription fees for the first year, while Apple takes 30%. Apple\u2019s share drops to 15% in year two\nIn addition to the monetary concerns, publishers are rebelling at the idea of Apple controlling users\u2019 email addresses and credit card information. That information is valuable to publishers, as they use it to create customer databases for marketing their products, and for sale to advertisers.\nApple is expected to unveil both its streaming TV service and its news service in a star-studded event on March 25.",

In addition to ECG, however, the Series 4 has a fall detection functionality. That feature is what one Norweigan Apple Watch user credits with saving his life.\nAs reported by NRK, 67-year-old Toralv \u00d8stvang was found \u201cbloody and unconscious\u201d on his bathroom floor by emergency authorities. According to the report, \u00d8stvang fell in his bathroom, with the Apple Watch automatically alerting emergency authorities.\n\u00d8stvang\u2019s daughter says that he likely went to the bathroom in the middle of the night, but fainted and fell to the floor. During the fall, \u00d8stvang sustained three fractures in his face. The daughter explains (translated):\n\u201cIt could have gone so much worse. All morning we asked, \u2018What had happened if he hadn\u2019t worn a smart watch?\u2019 He didn\u2019t bring his mobile phone in the bathroom. It\u2019s amazing that he got such quick help from the alarm, until the police found him. It was a serious fall, perhaps it saved his life.\u201d\nThe daughter also adds that \u00d8stvang had never considered having any other form of alert system, making it all the more notable he was wearing his Apple Watch that just happened to have fall detection.\nFall detection on the Apple Watch is able to track when you fall and then ask you if you are ok. If it sees that you are unresponsive for 1-minute, it will automatically call emergency services and share your current location with them. That seems to be exactly what happened to \u00d8stvang.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Apple Watch fall detection has been credit with saving someone. Back in October, a user in Sweden reported that the Apple Watch had called emergency authorities when he had a sudden back injury and fell to the floor.\nApple Watch fall detection is enabled automatically for users 65-years-old and older. To enable it, go into the Watch app on your iPhone, choose \u201cEmergency SOS,\u201d and enable the fall detection slider.\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
