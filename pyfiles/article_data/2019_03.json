        "body": "Tim Cook is a pretty well-known figure in the business world. I know a lot of people don\u2019t care about computers and that\u2019s fine, but if you\u2019re in the industry or having some sort of professional interaction with him, I have to think people usually know his name going in.\nAnd yet, at an American Workforce Policy Advisory Board meeting today, the president pretty unmistakably called Tim Cook \u201cTim Apple.\u201d\nAt first I thought I was just hearing things? Then I thought it might have been part of a trailing sentence like \u201cThank you Tim... Apple is doing great.\u201d But no, he stops pretty abruptly after saying Apple, and it really sounds like he thinks that\u2019s the last name.\nI went through the trouble of transcribing what the president said, just to be sure this is all really happening:\nWe\u2019re going to be opening up the labor forces because we have to. We have so many companies coming in,\u201d Trump says. \u201cPeople like Tim \u2014 you\u2019re expanding all over and doing things that I really wanted you to do right from the beginning. I used to say, \u2018Tim, you gotta start doing it here,\u2019 and you really have you\u2019ve really put a big investment in our country. We appreciate it very much, Tim Apple.\nHere\u2019s the clip:\nTrump has a long history of flubbing people\u2019s names, usually swapping out the first name for something more alliterative. He\u2019s even messed up the names of executives before, like calling Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin CEO, Marillyn Lockheed:",

        "title": "Apple cancels AirPower product, citing inability to meet its high standards for hardware",
        "body": "Apple has canceled the AirPower product completely, citing difficulty meeting its own standards.\n\u201cAfter much effort, we\u2019ve concluded AirPower will not achieve our high standards and we have cancelled the project. We apologize to those customers who were looking forward to this launch. We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward,\u201d said Dan Riccio, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering in an emailed statement today.\nAfter a delay of over a year since it was first announced in September of 2017, the AirPower charging mat has become something of a focal point for Apple\u2019s recent habit of announcing envelope tickling products and not actually shipping them on time. The AirPods, famously, had a bit of a delay before becoming widely available, and were shipped in limited quantities before finally hitting their stride and becoming a genuine cultural moment.\nAirPower, however, has had far more time to marinate in the soup of public opinion since it was announced. Along with recent MacBook keyboard troubles, this has functioned as a sort of flash point over discussion that something isn\u2019t right with Apple\u2019s hardware processes.\nEverything I\u2019ve personally heard (Apple is saying nothing officially) about the AirPower delay has been related to tough engineering problems related to the laws of physics. Specifically, I\u2019ve heard that they ran too hot because the 3D charging coils in close proximity to one another required very, very cautious power management.\nAlways worth reading @gruber\u2019s show recaps. The AirPower situation is real \u2013 heat is a problem and it was shown off too early. Sometimes Apple does this and eng rises to the challenge and delivers. Sometimes, physics. https://t.co/2YNlpPO1qO \u2014 Matthew Panzarino (@panzer) September 16, 2018\nObviously, it would do Apple very little good to release a charging mat that caused devices to overheat, perhaps even to the point of damage. So, it has canceled the project. If you know more about this, feel free to reach out, I\u2019m fascinated.\nThere have been other scenarios where Apple has pushed the hardware envelope hard and managed to pull it off and ship them, the iPhone 7 Plus, its first with a twin-lens system, being one that jumps to mind. Apple had a fallback plan in a single-lens version but at some point had to commit and step off a ledge to get it done in time to ship \u2014 even though knowing they still had problems to solve. Apple has done this many times over the years, but has managed to ship a lot of them.\nAirPower, however, was the other kind of case. The project was apparently canceled so recently that boxes of the new AirPod cases even have pictures of AirPower on them and the new AirPod sets have mentions of AirPower.\nThis is a very, very rare public misstep for Apple. Never, throughout the discussion about when AirPower might be released, did the overall trend of the discussion lean toward \u201cnever.\u201d That\u2019s a testament to the ability of its hardware engineering teams to consistently execute features that seemed to be nearly impossible over the years. In this case, it appears that the engineering issues have proven, at least at this point, insurmountable.\nThe fact of the matter is that hardware is, well, hard. The basic concepts of wireless charging are well known and established, but by promising the ability to place multiple devices anywhere on a pad, allowing them to charge simultaneously while communicating charge levels and rates, Apple set its bar incredibly high for AirPower. Too high, in this case.",

        "title": "Spotify files complaint with European Commission about the App Store, says Apple is giving itself an \u2018unfair advantage at every turn\u2019",
        "body": "Spotify has filed a complaint with the European Commission regarding Apple\u2019s App Store practices, the company announced in a blog post. Spotify says Apple\u2019s App Store rules limit choice and stifle innovation.\nSpotify targets Apple\u2019s 30% cut \u2014 it refers to as a \u2018tax\u2019 \u2014 as a key element of its complaint but also references rules about how Apple restricts third-party app developers from communicating with customers. Ultimately, Spotify wants Apple Music to be forced to abide by the same rules that Apple imposes on third-party apps.\nSpotify says Apple is giving itself an \u201cunfair advantage at every turn\u201d. Citing a failure to resolve its issues with Apple directly, it is turning to legal action with a formal complaint to the European Commission.\nThe 30% cut is certainly a big barrier to competition, as it means services like Spotify have to raise prices to offset the tariff whilst Apple\u2019s own music service does not have to bear the same cost. However, whether these rules count as anticompetitive behaviour is something that will have to be decided in court.\nOne comparison Spotify draws on is that apps like Uber and Deliveroo do not have to use Apple\u2019s payment system and therefore do not have to account for Apple\u2019s 30% revenue share.\nThis is because Apple\u2019s App Store rules only apply to digital purchases. Purchases of products and real-world services are permitted to use alternative payment methods. In fact, they are outright not allowed to use Apple\u2019s In-App Purchase system even if they wanted to. This is also why you can buy goods in the Amazon app and have them delivered to your door, only using your Amazon payment method.\nSpotify also says that Apple \u201croutinely blocks experience enhancing upgrades\u201d and locks out Spotify from Siri, HomePod and Apple Watch. Spotify says it tried to submit a Watch app to the App Store in 2015 and 2016, but was blocked by Apple. It doesn\u2019t expound on the reasoning unfortunately.\nSpotify has set up an entire website to illustrate its case; TimeToPlayFair.com. The European Commission now has to decide whether to proceed with an investigation. A resolution will likely take years, unless Apple and Spotify can come to some sort of agreement on their own. Spotify says it filed the case with Europe as it is a European company, headquartered in Sweden, but may pursue cases with regulators in other regions in the future as well.",

All of that authorization information is stored directly in the Apple Wallet app.\nApple also says that it\u2019ll use machine learning and Apple Maps to label stores that you use in the app, and use that data to track purchases across categories like \u201cfood and drink\u201d or \u201cshopping.\u201d\nInstead of a points-based reward program, Apple Card gives cash back rewards in the form of Daily Cash, which is applied straight to your Apple Card to spend or put toward your purchases. Apple is offering 2 percent cash back on purchases made through Apple Pay using an Apple Card, and purchases from Apple will get 3 percent cash back. Purchases made through the physical card will get just 1 percent cash back, though.\nAs rumored, Apple is partnering with Goldman Sachs for Apple Card, with Mastercard handling payment processing. Additionally, the company is promising that there will be \u201cno late fees, no annual fees, no international fees, and no over limit fees\u201d with the Apple Card and \u201clower interest rates\u201d with no penalties for missing payments, with APR rates ranging from 13.24 percent to 24.24 percent based on credit. (The company also notes that \u201clate or missed payments will result in additional interest accumulating toward the customer\u2019s balance.\u201d)",

        "title": "Addressing Spotify's Claims",
        "body": "We believe that technology achieves its true potential when we infuse it with human creativity and ingenuity. From our earliest days, we\u2019ve built our devices, software and services to help artists, musicians, creators and visionaries do what they do best.\nSixteen years ago, we launched the iTunes Store with the idea that there should be a trusted place where users discover and purchase great music and every creator is treated fairly. The result revolutionized the music industry, and our love of music and the people who make it are deeply engrained in Apple.\nEleven years ago, the App Store brought that same passion for creativity to mobile apps. In the decade since, the App Store has helped create many millions of jobs, generated more than $120 billion for developers and created new industries through businesses started and grown entirely in the App Store ecosystem.\nAt its core, the App Store is a safe, secure platform where users can have faith in the apps they discover and the transactions they make. And developers, from first-time engineers to larger companies, can rest assured that everyone is playing by the same set of rules.\nThat\u2019s how it should be. We want more app businesses to thrive \u2014 including the ones that compete with some aspect of our business, because they drive us to be better.\nWhat Spotify is demanding is something very different. After using the App Store for years to dramatically grow their business, Spotify seeks to keep all the benefits of the App Store ecosystem \u2014 including the substantial revenue that they draw from the App Store\u2019s customers \u2014 without making any contributions to that marketplace. At the same time, they distribute the music you love while making ever-smaller contributions to the artists, musicians and songwriters who create it \u2014 even going so far as to take these creators to court.\nSpotify has every right to determine their own business model, but we feel an obligation to respond when Spotify wraps its financial motivations in misleading rhetoric about who we are, what we\u2019ve built and what we do to support independent developers, musicians, songwriters and creators of all stripes.\nSo we want to address a few key points:",

        "title": "Rumors: AirPods wireless charging will charge to full in 15 minutes, thicker and heavier case, Dark Mode coming in iOS 13.1",
        "body": "Apple has been promising the AirPods wireless charging case for 537 days (and counting). Twitter leaker Max Weinbach was featured in EverythingApplePro\u2019s video today with some few tidbits on the AirPods wireless charging situation. However, Weinbach doesn\u2019t really have a track record of accuracy yet with Apple news, so we are treating these reports as sketchy rumors at this time.\nWe have seen several sources indicate that AirPower and AirPods wireless charging will launch within the next few months. Weinbach reaffirms these claims with some additional specific details.\nHe says that the charging speed of the AirPods in the wireless charging case will be \u2018very fast\u2019, going from zero to 100% charge in about fifteen minutes. Apple\u2019s current AirPods tout 3 hours of use with a fifteen minute charge, so going from nothing to 100% in the same timeframe would represent a significant speed upgrade.\nHowever, in exchange for the integration of the Qi coils, the charging case is apparently getting thicker and heavier. We expect this to be a relatively marginal variation in size, but still noticeable. It will also supposedly be slightly longer in one dimension. The AirPods 2 are described as featuring a look and feel similar to the Apple Pencil 2; less glossy and more matte.\nThere are some rumors that the 2019 iPhones will also feature this kind of matte glass appearance, so it could be a new trend for all of Apple\u2019s upcoming product redesigns.\nIn a previous tweet, Weinbach claimed that iOS 13 will not include Dark Mode. Instead, it will come in a point release update, like iOS 13.1 as work on the feature is lagging behind schedule. Again, Weinbach has some history in the Android space but is new to the Apple rumors game and we are treating his claims as tentative until they can be proven (or disproven) later this year.\nTo clarify, it will probably be iOS 13.1. There is a small chance it makes it to iOS 13. https://t.co/wYwxRxwohE \u2014 Max Weinbach (@mweinbachXDA) February 23, 2019",

        "title": "For the first time in years, Apple is hiring more software people than hardware people",
        "body": "Apple ($AAPL) started as a hardware company. Its first product was a kit: a box of hardware that customers had to assemble on their own. There was no software included. That, again, was up to the customer.\nBut what eventually differentiated Apple was its user-friendly software that made the hardware disappear. Product design has always been a critical difference-maker for the company \u2014 the iPhone's capacitive touchscreen, the iPods simple elegance, the MacBook's slim profile \u2014 but as the company looks to the future, it's beginning to look more like a software company than anything.\nOne could make that point by simply pointing at its burgeoning media business, but the hard truth lies in Apple's job listings data when tracked over time. As of today, \"Software and Services\" (previously known as Software Engineering) is, for the first time, the most-populous category for which Apple is hiring.\nSince 2016, Apple HR's most in-demand job category was always Hardware Engineering. For most of 2016 through 2018, it far outweighed Software by demand.\nBut in the third quarter of 2018, for the first time, Software Engineers became the most-in-demand professionals at Apple. This coincides with when Apple began talking more about its software and services like Apple Music, a new video streaming service, and a news and editorial subscription service.\nIt makes sense for Apple: its hardware is now not only ubiquitous, but demand has finally plateaud. At the end of 2018 (right around when Apple began its earnest search for more software people), it became very clear that the iPhone was no longer Apple's meal ticket as sales lagged followed by a very rare warnings call from Tim Cook.\nSo now what? Lock people into the ecosystem with software and services. How to get there? Hire people who know how to build that walled garden.\nAd placeholder",

        "body": "The Netflix logo is seen on their office in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 16, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc, the world\u2019s dominant streaming service, will not make its TV shows and movies available through Apple Inc\u2019s upcoming video offering, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on Monday.\n\u201cWe prefer to let our customers watch our content on our service,\u201d Hastings told reporters at the company\u2019s offices in Hollywood. \u201cWe have chosen not to integrate with their service.\u201d\nApple is expected to unveil a television and video service at an event on March 25, a move that will amp up competition for Netflix and others that deliver entertainment programing online.\nSources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that the service may resell subscriptions from CBS Corp, Viacom Inc and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp\u2019s Starz among others, as well as Apple\u2019s own original content.\nWalt Disney Co and AT&T Inc\u2019s WarnerMedia also plan to offer subscription streaming services.\nAsked about the looming competition, Hastings said the biggest challenge for Netflix is to \u201cnot get too distracted\u201d by rivals but still \u201clearn lessons\u201d from them.\n\u201cThese are amazing, large, well-funded companies with very significant efforts,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cThey are going to do some great shows. I\u2019m going to be envious. They\u2019re going to come up with some great ideas. We\u2019re going to want to borrow those.\u201d\nBut, he added, \u201cwe will make this a better industry if we have great competitors.\u201d\nHastings also said he expected Netflix, like other U.S. technology companies, to be blocked in China \u201cfor a long time.\u201d",

        "title": "Apple sold 35 million AirPods in 2018, currently most popular 'hearable' brand",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nApple sold around 35 million AirPods during 2018, Counterpoint Research estimated on Friday, adding that the company represents the most popular \"hearable\" brand in the U.S. at the moment.\nIn an online survey of over 200 people, 19 percent preferred Apple, Counterpoint said. The firm defines a \"hearable\" as wireless earbuds, which are mostly limited to audio at the moment but in some cases already include health tracking or AI assistants, such as the Bragi Dash Pro. Rumors have suggested that second-generation AirPods could include health tracking.\nApple-owned Beats is separate in Counterpoint rankings, taking fifth place with 6 percent. Others in the top five include Sony (17 percent), Samsung (16 percent), and Bose (10 percent).\nAmong AirPods buyers, \"comfort and fit\" was the prime consideration, followed by ease of use. Sound quality was actually a minor one, chosen by just 41 percent.\nFor contrast Counterpoint highlighted Bose, where sound quality was the top motivator at 72 percent.\nApple hasn't said exactly how many AirPods it sells, and markets the product mostly in terms of ease-of-use. The buds can, for example, automatically pair with a nearby Apple device, and then sync with every device linked to the same Apple ID.",

        "title": "Apple Advances Face ID to be 'Twin Proof' using Machine Learning, Subepidermal Imaging and more",
        "body": "On Monday Patently Apple posted a report titled \"Samsung's Galaxy S10 Face Unlock Feature has been proven to be absolutely useless.\" Samsung is learning quickly that copying Apple's Face ID isn't as easy as they thought. That's not to say that Face ID is perfect, because it's had a few hiccups when it comes to differentiating between identical twins. Apple's SVP Worldwide Marketing pointed out this minor flaw in his iPhone X keynote segment introducing Face ID by using a slide titled 'Evil Twin' as you can see below.\nSince that time Apple has been hard at work inventing ways to secure future iPhones for twins with advanced Face ID features like heat mapping and subepidermal imaging.\nApple notes in a patent application published today by the U.S. Patent Office that when it comes to authentication using facial recognition, there are potential cases where a user attempting to be authenticated (authorized) by a device cannot be distinguished from another user with closely related facial features. For example, it may be difficult for a facial recognition authentication process to distinguish between siblings, twins, and other closely related faces. When the authentication process cannot distinguish between closely related faces, additional authentication processes may be used to reduce or prevent increases in a false acceptance rate.\nFace ID with Subepidermal Imaging & Machine Learning\nApple's invention states that \"Subepidermal imaging of a face of a user attempting to unlock a device may be used to enhance a facial recognition authentication process (e.g., enhance the security of the facial recognition authentication process).\nSubepidermal images of the user may be used to assess subepidermal features such as blood vessels (e.g., veins) when the device is attempting to authenticate the user. The subepidermal features may be compared to templates of subepidermal features for an authorized (e.g., enrolled) user of the device.\nAssessment of subepidermal features during the facial recognition authentication process may be useful in distinguishing between users that have closely related facial features (e.g., siblings or twins).\nIn addition, assessment of subepidermal features may be used to prevent unlocking of the device by an unauthorized user wearing a mask or using another face replication method.\"\nApple's patent FIG. 8 below depicts a flowchart of an embodiment of additional authentication process #300. Additional the authentication process may be, for example, a vein matching authentication process used to distinguish between an unauthorized user and an authorized user that have closely related (e.g., very similar) facial features to prevent the unauthorized user from accessing device 100 without authorization.\nUsers with closely related (or very similar) facial features include users that have facial features that are close enough in distance (e.g., as defined by feature vectors in the feature space) that the similar facial features may be clustered together and/or there is at least some overlap between the similar facial features when assessing a matching score based on the facial features.\nIn certain embodiments, the process is operated by a different neural network modules and/or machine learning models than process. In some embodiments, different processes are operated by the same neural network module and/or machine learning model.\nIn certain embodiments, the process (#300) begins with capturing one or more subepidermal images of a user's face in (#302). A subepidermal image may be captured using an image sensor. In certain embodiments, the subepidermal image is captured when illuminating the face of the user with near-IR or another long wavelength illumination.\nThe subepidermal image may, however, be captured at another wavelength that provides more light penetration beneath the skin of the user (e.g., more penetration into the subepidermal layers). For example, the subepidermal image may be captured using illumination shifted about 10nm or more from the illumination used to capture the unlock attempt images. Shifting of the wavelength to lower wavelengths may, however, produce some light that is visible to a human eye (e.g., some light in or near the visible spectrum).\nIn some embodiments, the illumination for capturing subepidermal images is provided by one or more portions of illuminator 105A and/or illuminator 105B, shown in FIG. 2. For example, illuminator 105A and/or illuminator 105B may include an array of light sources such as, but not limited to, VCSELs (vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers). A first set of light sources in the array may provide illumination at a wavelength for unlock attempt images while a second set of light sources may provide illumination at a wavelength for subepidermal images. The different sets of light sources may be turned on/off separately to allow a specific illumination (e.g., a specific wavelength of illumination) to be provided.\nIn certain embodiments, the captured subepidermal image includes an image of one or more blood vessels (e.g., veins) in the user's face. Apple's patent FIG. 9 above depicts a representation of an embodiment of an image of subepidermal features in a user's face.\nAs shown in FIG. 9 above, the face includes a plurality of blood vessels (#402 e.g., veins). Unlike some other facial features on the surface of the skin of a user's face, veins in the subepidermal layers of the face are typically unique to an individual and vein patterns are different between different individuals, even siblings or twins. Thus, assessment of the veins (and vein patterns) in the subepidermal layers of the face may be used to distinguish between siblings, twins, or other users with similar facial features on the surface of the face.\nIn some embodiments, absorption properties of blood at a selected wavelength may be used to detect vein or other blood vessels in the subepidermal layers. Absorption properties of blood vessels may be useful in differentiating vein features in the eyes of the user.\nFace ID with Landmark Heat Maps\nIn a second patent application published today by USPTO Apple notes that in some cases, an image captured of a user during a facial recognition process (e.g., either an enrollment process or an authentication process) may include at least some occlusion of the user in the image. Occlusion of the user includes the blocking or obscuring of the user (e.g., the face of the user or some portion of the user's face) by some object (e.g., a finger, a hand, hair, masks, scarfs, etc.) in the image. Occlusion of the user in captured images may reduce the effectiveness of processing the image in the facial recognition process.\nLandmark and occlusion heat maps may be generated and used to assess occlusion of landmarks on a user's face in a captured image. Landmark heat maps may be grid representations of the user's face that are used to estimate the location of landmarks on the user's face in the captured image. The occlusion heat map may be a grid representation of the user's face that includes scaled values representing the amount of occlusion in the regions of the grid. The estimated locations of the landmarks may be used in combination with the occlusion heat map to determine if and how much occlusion of the landmarks there may be in the captured image (e.g., an occlusion score for each of the landmarks). Determined values of occlusion for the landmarks may be used to control one or more operations of the device.\nApple's first patent application covered in this report was originally filed in February 2018 while the second patent application was originally filed in March 2018. Considering that these are patent applications, the timing of such features for Face ID coming to market is unknown at this time.\nAbout Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

        "title": "Elizabeth Warren wants to break up Apple, too",
        "body": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed breaking up Amazon, Google, and Facebook yesterday in a post published on Medium. Her plan, which comes as the Democratic presidential primary contest continues to heat up, would classify any company that runs a marketplace and makes more than $25 billion a year in revenue as a \u201cplatform utility\u201d and prohibit those companies from using those platforms from selling their own products.\nUnder Warren\u2019s plan, Amazon would not be able to sell Amazon Basics products on the Amazon retail store, Google would not be able to promote its own products in Google search, and Facebook would have to split apart from Instagram and WhatsApp.\nBut Warren\u2019s proposal didn\u2019t mention Apple, which clearly matches the same set of criteria: the company makes far more than $25 billion a year in revenue, and it operates the iOS App Store, in which it distributes its own apps.\nI spoke to Sen. Warren after she appeared onstage at SXSW in Austin, Texas, today, and she told me explicitly that she thinks Apple should be broken apart, too \u2014 specifically, that it should not get to both run the App Store and distribute apps in it. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be one or the other,\u201d she said. \u201cEither they run the platform or they play in the store. They don\u2019t get to do both at the same time.\u201d\nWarren\u2019s plan to break up the world\u2019s biggest tech companies is by far the boldest overall tech regulation proposed thus far in the 2020 presidential cycle, and it\u2019s going to set off a fierce debate about antitrust policy among both Democrats and Republicans. After all, the push for stronger antitrust enforcement so far has actually come from conservatives.\nBelow is my interview with Warren, which has been lightly edited for clarity.\nSo you announced a pretty bold policy proposal yesterday to break up three of the biggest companies in the world. You listed Amazon, Google, and Facebook, and you said you would break them up because they make over $25 billion a year in global revenue, and they run markets in which they also participate.\nYep.\nThere was one company that fits that description that you did not mention.\nApple. They\u2019re in.\nYou want to break up Apple as well.\nYep.\nYou were very specific about how you\u2019d break up Google and the rest. How would you break up Apple?\nApple, you\u2019ve got to break it apart from their App Store. It\u2019s got to be one or the other. Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don\u2019t get to do both at the same time. So it\u2019s the same notion.\n\u201cApple, you\u2019ve got to break it apart from their App Store.\u201d\nPulling that apart, the App Store is the method by which Apple keeps the iPhone secure. It\u2019s integrated into the platform. How would you propose that Apple and Google distribute apps if they don\u2019t run the store?\nWell, are they in competition with others who are developing the products? That\u2019s the problem all the way through this, and it\u2019s what you have to keep looking for.\nIf you run a platform where others come to sell, then you don\u2019t get to sell your own items on the platform because you have two comparative advantages. One, you\u2019ve sucked up information about every buyer and every seller before you\u2019ve made a decision about what you\u2019re going to sell. And second, you have the capacity \u2014 because you run the platform \u2014 to prefer your product over anyone else\u2019s product. It gives an enormous comparative advantage to the platform.\n\u201cThis would not be the first time in US history that this kind of arrangement had to be broken up.\u201d\nThis would not be the first time in US history that this kind of arrangement had to be broken up. Back when the railroads were dominant, and you had to get steel or wheat onto the railroad, there was a period of time when the railroads figured out that they could make money not only by selling tickets on the railroad, but also by buying the steel company and then cutting the price of transporting steel for their own company and raising the price of transporting steel for any competitors. And that\u2019s how the giant grows.\nThe problem is that\u2019s not competition. That\u2019s just using market dominance, not because they had a better product or because they were somehow more customer-friendly or in a better place. It\u2019s just using market dominance. So my principle is exactly the same: what was applied to railroad companies more than a hundred years ago, we need to now look at those tech platforms the same way.\nWhy not mention Apple in your letter yesterday?\nNo special reason.\nThe comparison to railroads is really interesting because it was a very popular comparison during the net neutrality fight. The ISP runs the pipes, and you don\u2019t want them to interfere with what happens on them. Would you also break up NBCUniversal and Comcast?\nYes. In fact, I\u2019m already on record. I\u2019ve actually already weighed in on that. I\u2019ve sent letters, asked for hearings. I think I\u2019ve done questions for the record in hearings. I\u2019m already there. I\u2019m clearly on record on it.\nObviously, the DOJ just lost with AT&T / Time Warner. You don\u2019t look very happy about that. How would you unwind that one?\nThere\u2019s two different questions. How well do I think the Justice Department and the FTC are doing? Not well at all, and not well for a long time now.\nBut the other half \u2014 how you break these things apart? \u2014 again, back in the days when we enforced antitrust laws, we did this for a long time. You peel the two pieces off. The easy one, obviously, is something like Amazon. It\u2019s not very hard to see. You just say, \u201cOkay, there\u2019s an Amazon that runs the platform, that runs the store and people get shares of stock in that, and then all the little businesses, you get shares of stock in those, and they are now separated from each other.\u201d\n\u201cThe algorithm, at least in theory, goes back to being a neutral algorithm.\u201d\nThen the platform has no reason to prefer what had been an Amazon-based seller of toasters or pet pillows or whatever it turns out to be, and we\u2019ve got a robust marketplace with people competing once again. [The platform] also would have no interest in moving [search results] up to page one rather than page six. The algorithm, at least in theory, goes back to being a neutral algorithm.\nSo with railroads and ISPs, there\u2019s a natural monopoly element. It\u2019s hard to build a railroad. It\u2019s hard to lay fiber. Is there an equivalent natural monopoly that you see with the giant platforms that leads to a regulatory move?\nYou know, the natural monopoly argument is actually... not everyone accepts it. And there\u2019s some back-and-forth about whether that\u2019s the phenomenon we\u2019re dealing with here or not. My view is: I don\u2019t care. [Laughs] I\u2019m sorry. What I do care about is I can see the advantages the platform gets, and because of that I say, \u201cStop. You cannot use that information, the data you\u2019re able to collect.\u201d Because, literally play this game out a million times, right? There will be no competition.\nThere shouldn\u2019t be only six companies.\nThat\u2019s right. There should not be only six companies.\nAt $25 billion [in annual revenue to trigger a breakup], you\u2019re not anticipating that the local supermarket is going to stop having to do house brands.\nExactly. And no one\u2019s looking for that. You\u2019re getting into the nuance that actually this is a two-level regulation. The one that\u2019s caught all of the headlines is that, for everybody above $25 billion, you got to break off the platform for many of the ancillary or affiliated businesses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve just got a bright-line rule, you don\u2019t need the regulators.\u201d\nBut between $90 million and $25 billion [in annual global revenue], the answer is to say if you run a platform, you have an obligation of neutrality, so you can\u2019t engage in discriminatory pricing. Obviously, it\u2019s like the net neutrality rule: you can\u2019t speed up some folks and slow down other folks, which is another way of pricing. So there\u2019s an obligation of neutrality.\nThe advantage to breaking them up at the top [tier] rather than just simply saying, \u201cGosh, girl, why didn\u2019t you just go for obligation of neutrality all the way through?\u201d is that it actually makes regulation far easier. When you\u2019ve just got a bright-line rule, you don\u2019t need the regulators. At that point, the market will discipline itself. If Amazon the platform has no economic interest in any of the formerly-known-as-Amazon businesses, you\u2019re done. It takes care of itself.\nYou don\u2019t think Jeff Bezos is going to manage himself to $24.99 billion a year in revenue?\nIf he did, he would have a neutrality obligation, and he\u2019d have regulators crawling all over him. He might decide he\u2019d rather be at $25 billion and split it all up.\nYou know, everybody should keep in mind that when they split Standard Oil into all the components like Standard of Ohio and Standard of New Jersey and Standard of California and so on, they actually ended up turning a bigger profit for everybody who\u2019s been shareholders and executives because the broken apart [companies] let people get in and trade more. And there was more competition. They weren\u2019t getting the monopoly profits \u2014that\u2019s the downside \u2014 but some of them got a whole lot more competitive. And that\u2019s a good thing. If those spinoff Amazon businesses are really damn good, have at it, baby.\nThat\u2019s what this is all about. What I object to is when they\u2019re getting their profits because they\u2019re sucking out specialty secret information that nobody else gets, or they\u2019re getting prime placement in terms of when they show up on a search.\nSo you\u2019re articulating a bright-line rule. A lot of conversations I\u2019ve had with antitrust people like the Tim Wus and Lina Khans of the world, they\u2019re saying we need to change the standard. We need to go from the consumer welfare antitrust standard to a European-style competition standard. Are you advocating that we change the antitrust standard?\nI just think it\u2019s a lot harder to enforce that against a giant that has huge political power.\nSo you\u2019re in favor of leaving the consumer welfare standard alone?\nLook, would I love to have [that changed] as well? Sure. I have no problem with that.\nMy problem is in the other direction: there are times when hard, bright-line rules are the easiest to enforce, and therefore you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll get the result you want.\nLet me give you an example of that: I\u2019ve been arguing for a long time now for reinstatement of [the] Glass-Steagall [Act]. And my argument is basically, don\u2019t tell me that the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency can crawl through Citibank and JPMorgan Chase and figure out whether or not they\u2019re taking on too much risk and whether they\u2019ve integrated and cross-subsidized businesses. Just break off the boring banking part \u2014 the checking accounts, the savings accounts, what you and I would call commercial banking \u2014 from investment banking, where you go take a high flyer on this stock or that new business.\nWhen you break those two apart, you actually need fewer regulators and less intrusion on the business.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only economic power that we need to worry about from the Amazons of the world \u2014 we have to worry about their political power as well.\u201d\nYou also get more assurance it really happened. We live in an America where it\u2019s not only economic power that we need to worry about from the Amazons and Facebooks and Googles and Apples of the world. We have to worry about their political power as well. There\u2019s a reason that the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are not more aggressive. There was a time, long ago, when they were more aggressive, a golden age of antitrust enforcement.",

The company has just tweeted the announcement that its dark mode with a proper black background, which it\u2019s dubbing \u201clights out,\u201d is rolling out today, but only for its iOS app. No luck for Android users, at least for now.\nWith every modern flagship phone, iPhones included, now having an OLED screen, the use of a black background in the most popular apps can really be a help with extending battery life. The OLED panel only lights up the pixels that aren\u2019t black, so a lot of energy can be saved if you\u2019re just perusing the endless scroll of pained screams into the digital ether in the true dark.

        "body": "Update: The AirPower image has been removed from Apple\u2019s servers, but the HTML and CSS references remain for now. Who knows when AirPower will show up for real?\nThe AirPods page was updated yesterday to highlight the new features in the updated model and mentions the wireless charging case. However, the previously featured picture of AirPods and an iPhone X laying on the AirPower mat was removed in the redesign.\nIt turns out \u2014 there is actually a new never-before-seen official AirPower image hidden in the source code that was intended to be on the AirPods page. It shows the new AirPods charging case and \u201cDavid\u2019s\u201d iPhone XS laying on the so far unreleased AirPower mat \u2026\nThanks to Michael Bateman who originally tipped us off to the discrepancy. The US AirPods page does not include reference to the , but it exists on the Australian site.\nThe image doesn\u2019t show up as the styling isn\u2019t fully formed, but we managed to pull the image straight off Apple\u2019s servers. We\u2019ve mocked up where it is meant to be placed on the page, if it was enabled:\nUnsurprisingly, the image is meant to directly accompany the marketing copy that describes the how the wireless charging case works.\nAs a reminder, here\u2019s what the old AirPower image looked like on the AirPods page, before it was removed.\nThe AirPower mat is capable of charging three devices simultaneously, but the company has always depicted it with just iPhone and AirPods for the AirPods-specific marketing. Apple only showed the AirPower mat with the Apple Watch as well on the watch site before the Series 4 introduction. The physical appearance of the mat does not seem to have changed.\nThe biggest difference is the switch from iPhone X to iPhone XS bubble wallpaper, but if you look more closely, the design of the on-screen charging interface has also been tweaked. The time is no longer visible and the \u2018Charging Case\u2019 label has been renamed to \u2018AirPod Case\u2019. The owner has also changed from Sam to David \u2014 lucky AirPower owners.\nMany were expecting an AirPower announcement today, following the iMac, iPad Air and iPad mini, and second-generation AirPods, but that didn\u2019t happen this morning at the same time as the prior announcements.\nWe aren\u2019t sure when Apple is planning to announce the mat\u2019s actual release, but clearly the AirPods page was specially designed to be able to incorporate the AirPower mat when it is official. And the change of image asset certainly indicates continued development on the product.\nLet\u2019s hope they announce it soon.",

        "title": "Apple reportedly close to adding HBO, Showtime, and Starz to upcoming video service",
        "body": "Apple is expected to reach deals with HBO, Showtime, and Starz in time for its March 25th event, which will mark the debut of the company\u2019s anticipated subscription video service. Finding content partners is proving critical, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, because the vast majority of TV shows and movies on the new service at launch will be from third parties.\nApple has been pouring money into original programming and has signed deals with plenty of big names \u2014 many of them will be attending the event at Steve Jobs Theater \u2014 but those efforts reportedly aren\u2019t yet far enough along to be ready on day one. But the company will have at least some existing content of its own to fall back on, like Carpool Karaoke: The Series.\nThe three premium networks are still reportedly negotiating with Apple over things like user experience and marketing, but a deal with at least some of them could be finalized by Friday. It\u2019s previously been reported that Netflix and Hulu both want nothing to do with Apple\u2019s service. Hulu currently allows its content to be listed in the Apple TV app, but that seems to be as far as the company wants to take its relationship with Apple. Netflix, meanwhile, has grown so tired of Apple\u2019s subscription terms that it no longer allows customers to sign up directly from its iOS app.\nBloomberg again suggests that the service will live inside the Apple TV app on iOS and Apple TV. Having read up on all the rumors over the last few months, I\u2019m still a bit confused about what you\u2019ll actually be able to play from within Apple\u2019s service. Bloomberg makes it sound like Apple is signing content partnerships for Netflix-style, all-in-one streaming. But there are also indications that Apple plans to sell subscriptions to some partner video apps from the TV app. Will users still get kicked over to third-party apps for some content? What will the Apple TV app look like for non-subscribers after this service launches?",
