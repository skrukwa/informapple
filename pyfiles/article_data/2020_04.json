        "title": "The cheapest iPhone now has a more powerful processor than the most expensive Android phone",
        "body": "Apple has updated the little iPhone SE for 2020, and even an Android fan has to see that it's a great phone at an even greater price of $399 for the base model. It's essentially an iPhone 8 with one big difference: it has Apple's A13 Bionic chip buried inside. And that's a big deal for a number of reasons.\nI expect that some people are going to tell me about single thread versus multi-threaded performance and how the A13 GPU isn't that great or how iPhones have much lower resolution screens so the chips don't have to work as hard. All this is true, but another thing is true: the A13 is a stronger chip than the Snapdragon 865 for daily use in every category \u2014 we've seen this applied in real life in the iPhone 11 already. The only area it misses out is 5G, and that's because Apple just doesn't care about 5G yet. (The rumored iPhone 12 will almost certainly have a Qualcomm 5G chipset inside, for what it's worth.)\nThe Apple A13 is powerful enough to drive a laptop, let alone a smartphone.\nNerdy things like CPU threads aside, you'll notice how well the new iPhone SE performs when you use it. Everything in a modern smartphone from web browsing to camera performance to less-used things like AR depends on the processor. You need to crunch numbers really fast if you want your phone to respond really fast. The $399 iPhone SE will be able to do these things faster than the new OnePlus 8 Pro or the Samsung Galaxy S20+.\nIt sounds crazy to say that Apple including its expensive new chip in its budget phone makes sense, but it does. Apple has but a single processor to design, manufacture, support, store, and deliver. The cost over an older chip like the A11 is surely significant, but isn't going to be as high as supporting and shipping that A11 in what will likely be a very popular smartphone.\nWhen iOS 16 comes out the iPhone SE will get it on day one. We'll see the same for iOS 17, too.\nWhat sounds less crazy, and great to consumers, is that by using the A13 Apple can support the iPhone SE for years \u2014 and this phone will outlive the iPhone 8 it is slated to replace for a handful of extra years because of the new chip. Basically, if the iPhone 11 can get updated, so can the iPhone SE. This is cool to hear today, but it will be really important in three years when another version of iOS is released and your $399 iPhone gets it on day one.\nGet an iPhone SE with Mint Mobile service for just $30/mo (opens in new tab)\nAll of these reasons are also why it's so important that Google finds a way to build its own chips for its smartphones. It's been recently rumored (again) that Google is doing just that and has designed a new 5nm chip that will soon begin production for 2021 phones. This would allow Google to provide as many software updates as it pleases as well as build an in-house version of Android tailored for specific hardware that it controls.\nApple is laying out a roadmap for exactly what Google needs to do with its own chips.\nBuilding your own mobile chipset brings many advantages, and Apple is leveraging them today. Google really needs to do the same, and soon. It isn't guaranteed to be a win, as we've watched Samsung historically struggle with its in-house developed Exynos processors, but the potential upside is clearly there.\nThe iPhone SE may not be a better phone than something like the latest Pixel, Galaxy or OnePlus. It has a lesser screen, weaker single camera, doesn't have the wealth of OS features we've come to expect from an Android flagship, and you're still stuck with a lightning connector instead of a universal solution in USB-C. But when it comes to processor performance and future-proofing for software updates, the iPhone SE beats that Android flagship you're holding right now.",

        "title": "The new iPhone SE is a shockingly good value.",
        "body": "Yesterday, Apple announced the new $399 iPhone SE. The TL;DR appears to be really simple: the iPhone 8\u2019s body, the iPhone 11\u2019s processor, and the iPhone XR\u2019s camera system with a few new capabilities. I\u2019ll obviously wait to review this phone to tell you if it\u2019s any good, but assuming Apple lives up to its usual standards I can tell you something right away:\nAt $399, the second-generation iPhone SE is a shockingly good value.\nThe most important thing to know about the SE\u2019s value proposition is simply that it has the A13 Bionic processor, which is bar-none the fastest processor you can get on any smartphone at any price, full stop. You could spend $1,449 on a fully maxed-out iPhone 11 Pro Max and it wouldn\u2019t be faster than the iPhone SE. You could spend $1599.99 on a maxed-out Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G and it would be theoretically slower (with the exception of 5G downloads).\nThis isn\u2019t just a matter of processor megahertz per buck, it\u2019s a matter of the longevity of the phone itself. More than any other phone company, Apple supports its phones for a very long time. Since this iPhone SE has the most modern processor available, it\u2019s quite likely that it will receive software updates for many years to come.\nYou are reading Processor, a newsletter about computers, software, and tech by Dieter Bohn. Dieter writes about consumer tech, software, and the most important tech news of the day from The Verge. You can read an archive of Processor newsletters here and subscribe to all of The Verge\u2019s great videos here! Subscribe\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge that highlights top stories of the day, as well as occasional messages from sponsors and / or partners of The Verge.\nHell, Apple even did the right thing with storage: offering a humane 64GB at the base level and making the 128GB model only $50 more.\nOver the course of 2019, we marveled at the level of quality you could get in a long series of relatively inexpensive Android phones. That\u2019s still true today, but those phones will receive three years of updates from Google at most. And as my colleague Chris Welch will argue later today, the iPhone SE sets a bar that the upcoming Google Pixel 4A will have an incredibly difficult time clearing.\nAgain, we\u2019ll need to review the new iPhone SE and the Pixel 4A to know whether one of them has an advantage with any particular feature (like the camera). So no final judgements here. But I just need to point out that for most of 2018 and 2019, every Android maker has had a bit of a green field to play in: phones that cost less than $500.\nGoogle, Asus, Samsung, and many others did good work in that green field, but now there\u2019s real competition from Apple.\nOn Tuesday in this newsletter, I had half a thought about these low-cost phones. Forgive me for quoting myself:\nIncreasingly, I find that \u201cflagship\u201d phones are mainly about luxuries instead of tangible benefits to most people. Those luxuries include screen quality, 5G, wireless charging, face unlock, speed, overall build quality, camera quality, and a smattering of other things.\nWill the iPhone SE match the iPhone 11 or 11 Pro on most of those metrics? Nope. But when I wrote that I hadn\u2019t imagined that Apple would use its newest chip. The inclusion of the A13 Bionic means the SE will match the most luxurious phone on speed and on longevity.\nI know I\u2019ve now brought up software updates twice now, but it\u2019s super important. $399 spent on this iPhone SE means it\u2019s less likely you\u2019ll be forced to spend another $399 next year or the year after.\nThere are several things to be bummed about with the iPhone SE 2 \u2014 starting with the fact that Apple calls it the \u201csecond-generation iPhone SE,\u201d which is a bad name. Eventually we\u2019ll settle on what to call it, but until then prepare for iPhone SE, second-generation iPhone SE, iPhone SE 2, iPhone SE (2020), the new iPhone SE, and probably something I can\u2019t imagine right now. Ugh.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s a parts bin phone if the parts are good\nI kid, that\u2019s not really a real problem. Neither is the claim that this is just a \u201cparts bin\u201d phone. Yes, Apple is using a lot of parts that have been bouncing around its product lines for years. But, and I want you to really feel this: who cares? It doesn\u2019t matter how old the parts are if they\u2019re good.\nNo, there are real issues we know about already just from the basics. For example, this form factor \u2014 the same as the iPhone 6 \u2014 isn\u2019t especially inspiring. I hate the size of the bezels. It seems like a petty complaint, but reducing them really does change your experience. You get more screen in a smaller body. Plus, it\u2019s something most Android phones accomplished by putting a fingerprint sensor on the back or under the screen.\nSpeaking of size, this iPhone SE is larger than the last iPhone SE, which means that even \u2018small\u2019 phones are big now, as Dan Seifert observed yesterday. Finding a truly good, truly small smartphone is nigh impossible right now.\nYes, it\u2019s okay to be a little bummed about the missing headphone jack\nAnd though I know many people will tell me to just get over it already, the fact that this low-cost iPhone lacks a traditional headphone jack is a bit of a bummer. Other low-cost Android phones explicitly include them. Bluetooth headphones aren\u2019t just another thing to charge, they\u2019re another thing to buy and another thing that could break.\nApple has a reputation for overcharging for hardware. It\u2019s become a point of contention in the flamewars between Apple, Windows, and Android stans. My take is that sometimes Apple is guilty and sometimes it\u2019s not. The new MacBook Air is a great value. Selling Mac Pro wheels for $699 and literal metal posts for $299 is so incredibly hilarious that even pointing out that it\u2019s become self-parody feels so obvious it\u2019s embarrassing.\nOn that spectrum, the new iPhone SE (or whatever we decide to call it) is not just a good value for Apple. It\u2019s one of the very best values I\u2019ve seen in the smartphone market in years. In theory, at least: now we just have to test it and see if it lives up to its spec sheet.\nMore from Apple\u2019s announcements\n\u250f Apple\u2019s second-gen iPhone SE is here: all the news and details. Here\u2019s a story stream of all of our iPhone SE 2 coverage.\n\u250f The iPhone SE 2\u2019s camera setup is going to lean on Apple\u2019s software. Jon Porter on how Apple\u2019s advances in image processing are going to be vital to this phone\u2019s success.\n\u250f Apple\u2019s new iPhone SE doesn\u2019t come with custom U1 locator chip. It\u2019s not in the new iPad Pro with LiDAR either, where you would think it would make sense as the iPad Pro is practically designed for AR and AR development. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with the U1 chip (or AirTags), but increasingly it feels like something is weird about the whole thing.\n\u250f Apple\u2019s new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro goes up for preorder, ships next week. Here\u2019s something unexpected! Long ago I promised to share my thoughts on the trackpad support in iPadOS but haven\u2019t really finished that thought yet. When I review this, I will.\nMore from The Verge\n\u250f Dell\u2019s new XPS 13 is everything a Windows laptop should be. Monica Chin on what is going to be a contender for best Windows laptop of 2020, if not best laptop full stop:\nThe XPS 13 speaks for itself. This isn\u2019t a laptop that\u2019s trying to push boundaries or rewrite the rules; it\u2019s just giving users what they want. I would take a better webcam, I would take better cooling, I would take a USB-A, and I would take a slightly more color-accurate screen. But none of those are glaring flaws because they aren\u2019t big impediments to the user experience. And in the areas that matter most \u2014 build, display, keyboard, touchpad, battery life, performance \u2014 the XPS 13 doesn\u2019t just check all the boxes. It blows the boxes off the page.\nThe TurboGrafx-16 Mini fills a different niche.

Nicole Wetsman on what the rollout of this system should actually look like. It\u2019s clearly built to be part of a larger system of testing and communal action. If the latter doesn\u2019t come, the former won\u2019t be of use (and could actually be a detriment). As ever, we need more testing, more PPE, and consistent guidance from political leaders. All three are in short supply.\n\u250f How GM and Ford switched out pickup trucks for breathing machines. Sean O\u2019Kane explains how ventilators are much more complicated than you might realize.\nAutomakers are well-suited for these partnerships for a few reasons, according to Adrian Price, the global vehicle engineering director at Ford who\u2019s overseeing the company\u2019s ventilator effort. Not only do these companies already work with components that are similar to the ones found in ventilators, but cars are highly complex products that require a unique amount of knowledge, planning, coordination, and logistics to build.\n\u250f Russia conducts another test of its missile system to take out satellites. Loren Grush explains many of the reasons why these tests are not a good idea.\nASAT tests are also widely condemned by many in the space community, as these demonstrations typically create hundreds to thousands of pieces of debris that can last for months, and even years, in orbit. Because these tests are high speed and high impact, the resulting debris can spread far and wide. Those pieces then pose a threat to other functioning spacecraft.

        "title": "Ex-NSA hacker finds new Zoom flaws to takeover Macs again, including webcam, mic, and root access",
        "body": "Zoom, the popular video call service has had a number of privacy and security issues over the years and we\u2019ve seen several very recently as Zoom has seen usage skyrocket during the coronavirus pandemic. Now two new bugs have been discovered that allow hackers to take control of Macs including the webcam, microphone, and even full root access.\nUpdate 4/2: Zoom has issued an apology for its privacy and security gaffes, patched these two most recent Mac bugs, and laid out a plan for the next 90 days to improve the service.\nBut if you\u2019re still wanting to switch to another option, check out our roundup of 10 Zoom alternatives here.\nReported by TechCrunch, the new flaws were discovered by Ex-NSA hacker Patrick Wardle, now principal security researcher at Jamf, who detailed his findings on his blog Objective-See.\nWardle goes through a history of Zoom\u2019s privacy and security issues like the webcam hijacking we saw last summer, the calls not actually being end-to-end encrypted as the company claims, the iOS app sending user data to Facebook, and more.\nThat brings us to today. Wardle\u2019s new bug discoveries mean Macs are vulnerable to webcam and mic takeover again, in addition to taking gaining root access to a Mac. It does have to be a local attack but the bug makes it relatively easy for an attacker to gain total control in macOS through Zoom.\nAs such, today when Felix Seele also noted that the Zoom installer may invoke the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API to perform various privileged installation tasks, I decided to take a closer look. Almost immediately I uncovered several issues, including a vulnerability that leads to a trivial and reliable local privilege escalation (to root!).\nWardle describes the entire process in technical detail if you\u2019re interested but the flaw comes down to this:\nTo exploit Zoom, a local non-privileged attacker can simply replace or subvert the runwithroot script during an install (or upgrade?) to gain root access.\nThen, a second flaw Wardle discovered allows access for hackers to access a Mac\u2019s camera and mic and even record the screen, all without a user prompt.\nUnfortunately, Zoom has (for reasons unbeknown to me), a specific \u201cexclusion\u201d that allows malicious code to be injected into its process space, where said code can piggy-back off Zoom\u2019s (mic and camera) access! This give malicious code a way to either record Zoom meetings, or worse, access the mic and camera at arbitrary times (without the user access prompt)!\nZoom didn\u2019t respond to TechCrunch after a request for comment. With the millions of people using Zoom with the current global health crisis, hopefully, we see a fix real fast!\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "iPhone SE outperforms OnePlus 8 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S20+",
        "body": "Apple's A13 Bionic isn't just faster, it's deployed wider than any high-end Android chip\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nSeveral years ago, Apple's best chips began decisively beating the performance of the best chips available to high-end Android phones. Now, even Apple's $399 iPhone SE uses a more powerful brain than even the most advanced Android flagships with prices above $1,000. How is this possible?\n\"Apple is using the A13 Bionic in the 2020 edition of the iPhone SE and it outperforms the Snapdragon 865 in almost every way,\" noted Android Central blogger Jerry Hildenbrand. \"That's a big deal for a number of reasons,\" he added.\nApple's A13 Bionic vs Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865\n\"The A13 is a stronger chip than the Snapdragon 865 for daily use in every category,\" Hildenbrand noted, linking to the details of Qualcomm's introduction of its Snapdragon 865 as its best chip for premium Androids this year.\nLike Apple's A13 Bionic, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 is a 7nm component that bundles an ARM CPU, mobile GPU, an NSP for machine learning, an ISP for camera logic, and a variety of other audio, video, and security engines together into a single SoC or \"System on a Chip.\"\nYet despite all of Qualcomm's efforts, the Snapdragon 865 continues to fall behind Apple's best chip in basic CPU and GPU processing power. That has focused Qualcomm's marketing on promoting its support for 5G mobile networking instead, allowing it to advertise that at least in one respect, it is faster.\nHowever, 2020 is turning out to be a bad year to be pushing 5G as your only strength. It will be some time before 5G becomes broadly available outside of a few leading markets such as South Korea and specific urban markets. For budget phone buyers, 5G offers little more than faster battery drain and often the requirement to pay extra for mobile service, whether that 5G service is consistently available and capable of delivering noticeably better, real-world mobile data speeds than the best 4G LTE or not.\nSpeed and longevity\nOn the other hand, a fast, modern mobile chip with an advanced CPU and GPU delivers two major benefits. The first is its overall performance when you use it. As Hildenbrand noted, \"you'll notice how well the new iPhone SE performs when you use it.\"\nHe added, \"everything in a modern smartphone from web browsing to camera performance to less-used things like AR depends on the processor. You need to crunch numbers really fast if you want your phone to respond really fast. The $399 iPhone SE will be able to do these things faster than the new [$899] OnePlus 8 Pro or the [$1,000] Samsung Galaxy S20+.\"\nA second benefit to having Apple's newly released chip in its value-priced iPhone is the assurance that Apple will continue to support it for many years\u2014 likely as long as the iPhone 11 family using the same processor. When Apple drops support for older devices from a new release of iOS, it's often because they lack the silicon to take advantage of its latest advancements.\n\"When iOS 16 comes out the iPhone SE will get it on day one. We'll see the same for iOS 17, too,\" the Android Central piece predicted. Apple's latest iOS 13 continues to support iPhone 6s, a phone from 2015. That's ancient, particularly when considering that it's unusual for an Android to get updates for even two years, with supported devices often not getting the latest update until months after its release.\nBecause the new iPhone SE is expected to be officially supported by Apple in its latest iOS release for several years, the resale value for the phone will also remain much higher than basic Androids near the same price, or even higher-end Android flagships that lose their value faster and have more to lose.\nAndroid Central concluded that Apple's advantage in silicon speed and longevity is why \"it's so important that Google finds a way to build its own chips for its smartphone.\" But if a blogger in 2020 has figured that out, why didn't Google do the work to deliver advanced chips years ago?\nWhy is Apple so far ahead?\nGoogle did undertake a relatively ambitious effort in designing part of the brain of a mobile phone. Back in 2017 it created a standalone ISP for advanced photo imaging that it used in Pixel phones. But the problem was that while the camera was probably the best feature to focus on, it wasn't the only reason motivating phone buyers.\nThe only Pixel phone that's sold above minimal volumes was the 2019 Pixel 3a, which dropped Google's custom camera silicon to reach its price point. Pretty clearly, advanced custom silicon is harder to deliver than a lot of observers imagine it is.\nEven Android Central noted that Samsung's own attempt at developing its Exynos custom SoCs ended up in failure, despite building a campus and assembling leading talent without much of a budget holding them back. Samsung was still forced to make design concessions to minimize its cost, which resulted in poor performance that couldn't keep up with Qualcomm's, let alone Apple's.\nA decade ago, Android enthusiasts predicted that Apple would have a very difficult time competing against all of the hardware makers collaborating on Android. Parallels were drawn with Windows PC makers who were able to introduce new Intel CPUs faster than Apple could get its PowerPC chip partners to deliver new upgrades. Even after Apple shifted its Macs to Intel chips in 2006, it was still often at a disadvantage in rolling out Macs with a performance edge at a competitive price.\nThe prediction that this would repeat in mobile devices didn't materialize, however. Instead, Apple's business of building premium mobile devices\u2014 including iPhones with an average selling price of nearly $800 \u2014 has proven to be far more commercially successful than any specific Android maker\u2014 or all of the Android licensees put together.\nThis has had a greater and far more important impact than merely making Apple profitable. It has also allowed Apple to reinvest its profits in aggressively building the most advanced mobile processors. Designing and building state-of-the-art processors is not only fantastically expensive; it's also a high-risk effort.\nDeveloping advanced, custom silicon for devices that don't end up selling well has been a disastrous issue for a series of companies that have since exited the business of building chips for Android mobile makers, starting with Texas Instruments' OMAP and Nvidia Tegra, and continuing with Intel Atom.\nThe number of high-end Android phones supporting the production of advanced Qualcomm Snapdragon chips is not growing dramatically. Instead, the overall market for Android phones is retreating from iPhone-class competition and moving downmarket to the middle tier, where phones sell for around $300-$400.\nThis winter, Apple introduced iPhone 11 alongside a pair of ultra-premium iPhone 11 Pro models priced above $1,000. Yet rather than selling mostly older, cheaper models, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimated that just over a third of Apple's U.S. sales opted for the $699 iPhone 11, and nearly another third opted for the $999 and up iPhone 11 Pro.\nTwo thirds of Apple's iPhones sales are its best new high-end models\nFor over a decade, iPhone has maintained an incredible, unprecedented demand for fancy high-end products with innovative features, longevity, security, and battery life\u2014 all of which are driven by Apple's ability to deliver a steady stream of advanced new silicon every year.\nSamsung has never come close to selling such a high-end mix of Android phones, and most Android makers sell an even lower-end combination of devices. The average selling price of Androids has hovered around $250 to $300 for many years. That can't fund the competitive development of the most advanced chips, particularly when that cost is outsourced to a third party seeking to maximize profits in selling advanced chips to handset licensees.\nYet Apple also has another advantage in silicon: it's not just making iPhones. Apple's first A4 chip was introduced by Steve Jobs at the introduction of iPad in 2010. It was only released for iPhone 4 later that same year when it also debuted in Apple TV.\nApple's broad use and reuse of its chips\u2014 such as putting the A8 in its HomePod \u2014 enables the company to wring the most value of the work it has already invested in building custom silicon for iPhone and iPad. Additionally, its confidence that it will be able to sell tens of millions of iPads and hundreds of millions of high-end iPhones each year enables the company to drive an intense pace of annual upgrades that no other chip maker or device assembler can match.\nFurther, following the parallel leap in reinventing the classic iPhone to deliver iPhone X as a new form factor driven by swipe gestures and Face ID rather than a Home button and Touch ID has enabled Apple to sell its product to two totally different markets: the high-end of discerning tech adopters who are willing to pay a high premium for the best phone available, and a lower tier of customers who want a basic phone at a basic price.\nOver the holidays, Apple nearly satiated all the demand for expensive phones with its iPhone 11 family. It can now offer iPhone SE with the same processor and sell it to a class of users who are more concerned about price than some of the very latest features available.\nApple's previous iPhone 8 targeted the same group of basic iPhone buyers, which ranges from parents buying for their younger kids to enterprise deployments serving devices to their employees. iPhone SE effectively upgrades iPhone 8 to use an A13 chip and better lenses and cameras, while remaining differentiated from iPhone 11 and last year's iPhone XR.\nThe 2020 iPad Pro introduced LiDAR as a differentiating, modern feature advancing Augmented Reality\nWhen iPhone 12 ships this fall, it will again offer things iPhone SE doesn't, including an expected jump to 5G support and other camera and imaging exclusives, likely including the LiDAR sensor that debuted on the latest iPad Pro. It will also jump to an even more advanced A14 SoC that further advances Apple's lead and justifies the price premium of its fanciest iPhones for buyers who are less concerned about price than features.",

        "title": "Apple wants an iPhone that doesn't just survive underwater, but is usable there",
        "body": "Apple wants an iPhone that doesn't just survive underwater, but is usable there\nThis isn't nearly as wet an environment as Apple thinks you may want to use your iPhone\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nFuture iPads and iPhones could adapt to actually being used underwater, and a new way to sense orientation using the Face ID camera could see display rotation guided by the angle of your face in relation to the device.\nIt may seem as if the iPhone, iPad, and even Mac, have not changed their user interface in years, but in truth Apple is continually revising its software. Apple is also increasingly good at hardware surviving underwater, plus it continues to look into actually making devices remain usable when submerged.\nThese issues are revisited in two new patents, one of which will concern anyone who's truly wanted to operate an iOS device underwater. And the other uses technology to solve a small but recurring annoyance.\n\"Underwater User Interface\" argues that if you're going to use your device underwater, then the controls need to be simplified while you're submerged.\nThat's definitely the thing to be focusing on, how simple it is to operate the iPhone or iPad when you would otherwise be concentrating on swimming to the surface.\n\"Current methods for displaying user interfaces while an electronic device is under water are outdated, time consuming, and inefficient,\" complains the patent. \"For example, some existing methods use complex and time-consuming user interfaces, which may include multiple key presses or keystrokes, and may include extraneous user interfaces.\"\nApple also reckons that when something is cumbersome, it's also time-consuming. \"In addition, these methods take longer than necessary, thereby wasting energy,\" it says. \"This latter consideration is particularly important in battery-operated devices.\"\nA future device might alter and simplify its display controls when underwater, and also take into account the difference water makes to touch detection\n\"There is a need for electronic devices that provide efficient methods and interfaces for accessing underwater user interfaces displayed on the electronic devices,\" continues the patent. \"Such techniques can reduce the cognitive burden on a user who accesses user interfaces while the electronic device is under water, thereby enhancing productivity. Further, such techniques can reduce processor and battery power otherwise wasted on redundant user inputs.\"\nIn other words, if you're swimming for your life, you don't want to have to an \"Are you sure?\" dialog. However Apple's patent is not just about how many buttons you have to press. It's also about how the device tells you that you've pressed on it.\n\"[The device] optionally also includes one or more tactile output generators,\" it says. \"In some embodiments, at least one tactile output generator is collocated with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive display system) and, optionally, generates a tactile output by moving the touch-sensitive surface vertically (e.g., in/out of a surface of device) or laterally (e.g., back and forth in the same plane as a surface of device).\"\nSo the aim is that when you happen to be underwater with your device, the whole user interface will change. It can show you simpler controls, or remove steps, and it can then vibrate the device to show when you've used it.\nThere is much more detail \u2014 some 40,000 words of it \u2014 and the invention is credited to no less than 16 people. These include Richard J. Blanco, who is also listed on a related patent for \"Sealed electronic connectors for electronic devices.\" And also Xuefeng Wang, previously credited on a patent for a way that devices can detect when they're under sufficient strain that they may be damaged, and alerting the user about it.\nUsing your face to orient the device\nSeparately, an application for \"Using Face Detection to Update User Interface Orientation\" is about rotating a display to the right position.\nAll iPads have always automatically rotated their screen so that you can hold them in landscape or portrait, and such that you can hold them any way up. However, every iPad user has also had the experience of having to physically rotate the device in order to get it to check again after it's turned the wrong way.\n\"The orientation that the content is presented is often determined using accelerometers and/or other inertial sensors that determine the orientation of the device relative to gravity,\" says Apple's patent.\n\"There are, however, often situations in which these sensors cannot accurately or confidently determine the orientation of the device relative to gravity and the device will not change or update the orientation of the content to the proper orientation for the user or will update the orientation incorrectly,\" it continues.\nIt gets confused, really, and the most common cause of the confusion is when the iPad is not being held up by the user, but instead is on a table.\n\"[The] device may not be able to provide the content in a proper orientation to the user when the device is lying flat (e.g., face up on a flat surface),\" says the patent. \"When lying flat, even though the sensors may be accurately aware of the position of the device, the orientation relative to the user may be unknown.\"\nIt's hardly a gigantic problem, but it is annoying and Apple has clearly heard this a lot from people. \"In either of these situations, the user may become frustrated with the need to reorient the device and/or move the device to get content to display in the proper orientation,\" it says.\nThe solution is to no longer rely solely on these sensors, and instead supplement them with more information. Specifically, us. The iPad Pro has facial recognition now in the form of the Face ID that we use to unlock the device.\nThe same feature, or rather a small part of it, could be used to determine which way around our face is in relation to the device. So it wouldn't have to actually recognize us for authentication, it would simply see which way we must be looking at the device and alter what it shows to match.\n\"[Orientation] data obtained from a face detection process is used to determine or update the orientation of an application user interface (e.g., text and/or content) being displayed on a display of a device,\" says the patent.\nFuture devices could detect the orientation of a user's face and use that to determine the right rotation for its display\nThis could happen whenever the user picks up or wakes the device, and it could happen during the regular Face ID process. However, it could also be automatically triggered if the iPad has sufficient doubt about whether its other sensors are correct.\nAgain, this would not require a full Face ID recognition scan, but also again, it would be making more use of the existing technology. Apple's patent suggests that all of this could go further, with the device using Face ID not only to orient itself, but to change the information it displays.\nAlongside all of the technical detail about implementing such a system, Apple also stringently examines the privacy issues. An iPad might be unlocked, and then re-orient itself, according to the face it sees, but beyond that, the user must be able to decide what else happens.\n\"Use of such personal information data enables calculated control of access to devices,\" says the patent. \"[Entities providing or analyzing information] would be expected to implement and consistently apply privacy practices that are generally recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or governmental requirements for maintaining the privacy of users.",

        "body": "Apple paid out $75,000 to a hacker for identifying multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in its software, some of which could be used to hijack the camera on a MacBook or an iPhone, according to Forbes.\nA zero-day vulnerability refers to a security hole in software that is unknown to the software developer and the public, although it may already be known by attackers who are quietly exploiting it.\nSecurity researcher Ryan Pickren reportedly discovered the vulnerabilities in Safari after he decided to \"hammer the browser with obscure corner cases\" until it started showing weird behavior.\nThe bug hunter found seven exploits in all. The vulnerabilities involved the way that Safari parsed Uniform Resource Identifiers, managed web origins and initialized secure contexts, and three of them allowed him to get access to the camera by tricking the user to visit a malicious website.\n\"A bug like this shows why users should never feel totally confident that their camera is secure,\" Pickren said, \"regardless of operating system or manufacturer.\"\nPickren reported his research through Apple's Bug Bounty Program in December 2019. Apple validated all seven bugs immediately and shipped a fix for the camera kill chain a few weeks later. The camera exploit was patched in Safari 13.0.5, released January 28. The remaining zero-day vulnerabilities, which Apple judged to be less severe, were patched in Safari 13.1, released on March 24.\nApple opened its bug bounty program to all security researchers in December 2019. Prior to that, Apple's bug bounty program was invitation-based and non-iOS devices were not included. Apple also increased the maximum size of the bounty from $200,000 per exploit to $1 million depending on the nature of the security flaw.\nWhen submitting reports, researchers must include a detailed description of the issue, an explanation of the state of the system when the exploit works, and enough information for Apple to reliably reproduce the issue.\nThis year, Apple plans to provide vetted and trusted security researchers and hackers with \"dev\" iPhones, or special iPhones that provide deeper access to the underlying software and operating system that will make it easier for vulnerabilities to be discovered.\nThese iPhones are being provided as part of Apple's forthcoming iOS Security Research Device Program, which aims to encourage additional security researchers to disclose vulnerabilities, ultimately leading to more secure devices for consumers.",

        "body": "Apple today released a new beta of iOS 13.5 to developers, bringing the first version of its COVID-19 exposure notification API to public health authorities. The update also includes a small tweak that makes it easier to skip Face ID and enter your passcode if you\u2019re wearing a mask.\nWith this change, Face ID can detect if you\u2019re wearing a mask and skip directly to the passcode screen if so. It\u2019s impressive that Apple has developed it such that if you\u2019re not wearing a mask, Face ID still works as normal, with the experience only being changed when you are wearing one.\nWhile there are some workarounds, Face ID is not nearly as reliable if you\u2019re wearing a mask. Most of the time, it will fail to recognize you and eventually take you to the passcode option. This change significantly streamlines that process. When you swipe up to unlock, you\u2019ll be taken directly to the passcode screen.\nThe other major change in iOS 13.5 is the first version of Apple and Google\u2019s COVID-19 contact tracing API for exposure notification. You can read more about that in our full coverage here, but you\u2019ll find a new option in the Settings app for enabling exposure notifications:\niPhone is using Bluetooth to securely share your random IDs with nearby devices and collect their IDs. This enables an app to notify you if you may have been exposed to COVID-19. Random IDs are deleted after 14 days. Apps you authorize can notify you if you\u2019re exposed to COVID-19. You can also choose to anonymously share your COVID-19 diagnosis.\niOS 13.5 beta 3 is rolling out to developers today. Any revision of iOS that uses a new SDK must have its minor version number changed, hence the jump from iOS 13.4.5 to iOS 13.5. You can read more in our full coverage.\nSpot any major changes in the third developer beta of iOS 13.5? Let us know in the comments or on Twitter, @9to5Mac.\nAs pointed out by @Sonikku_a2, if you\u2019re wearing a mask, iOS 13.5 goes straight to the passcode screen if you try to unlock with Face ID (keypad not shown because iOS hides it in screen recordings) pic.twitter.com/bQCzu5u20p \u2014 Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) April 29, 2020\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

It turns out Facebook tried to buy controversial government spyware to monitor iPhone and iPad users.\nReported by Motherboard, when Facebook was starting to build its spyware cloaked in a VPN product, Onavo Protect for iOS and Android, the social media company reached out to the controversial company NSO Group that creates spyware for government agencies.\nA declaration from NSO Group\u2019s CEO, Shalev Hulio revealed that \u201ctwo Facebook representatives approached NSO in October 2017 and asked to purchase the right to use certain capabilities of Pegasus.\u201d\nFurther documentation in the lawsuit revealed that:\nit seems the Facebook representatives were not interested in buying parts of Pegasus as a hacking tool to remotely break into phones, but more as a way to more effectively monitor phones of users who had already installed Onavo.\nAnd in particular, Facebook thought Pegasus would give it an advantage in spying on iPhone and iPad users as Apple devices are more difficult to compromise than Android ones.\n\u201cThe Facebook representatives stated that Facebook was concerned that its method for gathering user data through Onavo Protect was less effective on Apple devices than on Android devices,\u201d the court filing reads. \u201cThe Facebook representatives also stated that Facebook wanted to use purported capabilities of Pegasus to monitor users on Apple devices and were willing to pay for the ability to monitor Onavo Protect users.\u201d\nNSO declined to sell Pegasus to Facebook, but it still built and launched Onavo without Pegasus as a spyware tool in early 2018 under the misleading pretense of being a VPN app.\nApple made Facebook remove Onavo Protect from the App Store in August of 2018.\nThen in 2019 Facebook repackaged it as a \u201cResearch app\u201d and tried to pay teens to sideload it on their devices.\nThe Research app was shut down as well and Facebook finally shutdown Onavo completely in February 2019.i\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "The iPad is the only tablet worth buying",
        "body": "Apple's newest iPad Pro is here. Complete with an LiDAR scanner and full trackpad support, it appears to be even more of a PC replacement than previous models. Even if you aren\u2019t looking to replace your trusty laptop, the iPad is an incredible device. In fact, it\u2019s the only tablet I\u2019d recommend buying after years of covering consumer technology \u2014 and I\u2019m not exactly what you\u2019d call an Apple fanatic. I use Windows on my main computer and a Chromebook for portable work. I\u2019ve also been a diehard Android phone user since the original Motorola Droid was released. In other words, this advice is not coming from a place of brand loyalty \u2014 it\u2019s coming from years of using the iPad alongside other tablets on the market.\nSKIP AHEAD What iPad model should you get?\nShould you get an iPad?\nWhile price has historically been a barrier to Apple\u2019s products, the current iPad lineup ranges from affordable to fairly expensive (and powerful). No matter which one you buy, it can probably handle most actions, including:\nYou may see the more demanding actions perform better on the higher-cost iPad models, but for the most part any model should work well for general use.\nWhat iPad model should you get?\nThe lowest-cost iPad \u2014 which is just named the \u201ciPad\u201d \u2014 is the seventh generation of Apple\u2019s venerable tablet. It boasts a super-sharp 10.2-inch display, up to 128GB of storage and Apple\u2019s A10 Fusion central processing unit (CPU). This is a slower CPU than more expensive models but you likely won't notice the difference. I\u2019m still using an older iPad with a comparable CPU and it runs like butter \u2014 even when playing games. At $329, you couldn\u2019t ask for a better bang for your buck.\nWhen I bought my current iPad \u2014 the 2016 9.7-inch iPad Pro \u2014 I planned on using it for comic books, games and computer magazines (yes, I\u2019m a huge nerd). A big screen was a must for me, but if you\u2019re just looking to read ebooks, browse Facebook and take your tablet anywhere, the smaller 7.9-inch iPad Mini could be an alternative.\nThe iPad Air, as its name implies, is slightly thinner than the regular iPad. But the real improvement comes in a faster A12 Bionic CPU, more available storage (up to 256GB) and extra features like a wide-color, anti-reflective, True Tone display for a more natural-looking image.\nAt 12.9 inches, the iPad Pro is closer to the size of a laptop and has a higher price tag (though there is a smaller and more affordable 11-inch model). This is the iPad for people looking to replace their computer and thanks to the most powerful processor in an iPad \u2014 the A12Z Bionic \u2014 and up to 1TB of storage, it will work well for all your digital creations.\nAndroid and Windows tablets can do similar things to an iPad, but the feel of using the device is why I chose an iPad. Android has struggled to get its tablet interface feeling as smooth and usable and many Android apps \u2014 from big names like Spotify to various magazines and lots of smaller third-party tools \u2014 are similar to phone apps blown up to fit the size of a tablet. Plus, a lot of apps come out on iOS before reaching other platforms, which can be frustrating if you have to wait for a new game to launch for your Android product.\nHow does the iPad compare to other tablets?\nI also prefer the iPad over Microsoft\u2019s tablet. The app interface isn't comparable and I end up spending most of my time in a browser, which just seems silly for the price.\nWhen it comes to longevity, I find that iPads last a relatively long time. Now, Android tablets might not get future updates since Google stopped manufacturing their own Android tablets. In addition to the actual product, I find that there are far more iPad-focused accessories like fold-out keyboard cases, than there are for any given Android tablet. Android and Windows tablets do have their advantages, of course.\nTablets like the $64 Walmart Onn and $50 Amazon Fire (which runs a modified version of Android with fewer apps) are unbeatable on price \u2014 just don\u2019t expect them to be very snappy or last very long.\nThe $150 Fire HD 10 is significantly better, but still can\u2019t hold a candle to a refurbished 2017 iPad that costs $60 more.\nSamsung has good options on the high end but I think the iPad still offers a better all-around experience for the money.\nWindows-based 2-in-1s are nice if you want a hybrid laptop/tablet form factor. However, I find these clunkier than a tablet \u2014 I\u2019d rather go with a cheaper non-touch laptop and put extra money toward an iPad. It\u2019s almost always going to be a better experience.\nCatch up on Select's in-depth coverage of personal finance, tech and tools, wellness and more, and follow us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to stay up to date.",

The underdog music service that is Pandora continues to show Spotify how third-party music services should work on the Apple Watch. Pandora now supports two key features that are must-haves on watchOS\u2026\nSpotify has complained over the last year that Apple doesn\u2019t play fair when it comes to working with third-parties. Meanwhile, Pandora has continued to roll out support for great features like streaming on Apple Watch and before that offline playback. Today, Pandora has debuted Siri support on Apple Watch along with upgrading its Siri capabilities with iOS.\nMy colleague Bradley Chambers argued almost a year ago when watchOS 6 launched with an API for third-party streaming on Apple Watch that it was time for Spotify to \u201cship or shut up,\u201d and in 2020 we\u2019re still watching Spotify integration lag way behind competitors like Pandora.\nSpotify did release Siri support for Apple Watch earlier this month, but two major features it\u2019s lacking are offline playback and streaming support (Pandora has both for watchOS), leaving Spotify on Apple Watch as a remote control for iPhone.\nSpotify has heard feedback from lots of its users about bringing the Apple Watch up to snuff, but for some disappointing reason, it hasn\u2019t been a priority. Some Spotify users have even mentioned leaving the service over the lack of Spotify\u2019s follow-through.\nNotably, all the way back in 2017, a third-party app called Snowy (previously Spotty) included offline playback for Spotify. The company then started \u201cworking\u201d with the developer on it but the app was later killed off.\nTime will tell if Spotify gets its Apple Watch act together in 2020.

        "title": "Apple and Google pledge to shut down coronavirus tracker when pandemic ends",
        "body": "On Friday, Apple and Google revised their ambitious automatic contact-tracing proposal, just two weeks after the system was first announced. An Apple representative said the changes were the result of feedback both companies had received about the specifications and how they might be improved. The companies also released a \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d page, which rehashes much of the information already made public.\nOn a call accompanying the announcement, representatives from each company pledged for the first time to disable the service after the outbreak had been sufficiently contained. Such a decision would have to be made on a region-by-region basis, and it\u2019s unclear how public health authorities would reach such a determination. However, the engineers stated definitively that the APIs were not intended to be maintained indefinitely.\nThe key schedule for the new encryption specification, which now includes Bluetooth metadata\nSome of the changes seem designed to address privacy concerns that came up after the initial release. Under the new encryption specification, daily tracing keys will now be randomly generated rather than mathematically derived from a user\u2019s private key. Crucially, the daily tracing key is shared with the central database if a user decides to report their positive diagnosis. Some encryption experts worried that under the old encryption protocol certain attacks might be able to link those keys with a particular user. Connecting a person to a diagnosis should be more difficult with the randomly generated keys. As part of the change, the daily key is now referred to as the \u201ctemporary tracing key,\u201d and the long-term tracing key included in the original specification is no longer present.\nThe new encryption specification also establishes specific protections around the metadata associated with the system\u2019s Bluetooth transmissions. Along with the random codes, devices will also broadcast their base power level (used in calculating proximity) and which version of the tool they are running. This information could potentially be used to fingerprint specific users, so the engineers laid out a new system for encrypting them such that they cannot be decoded in transit.\nThe companies are also changing the language they use to describe the project. The protocols were initially announced as a contact-tracing system, it is now referred to as an \u201cexposure notification\u201d system. While the proposed apps and protocols could stand in for some functions of traditional contact tracing, they can\u2019t do the more sophisticated work of interviewing subjects and identifying clusters of infection, which can then inform future public health efforts. The companies say the name change reflects that the new system should be \u201cin service of broader contact tracing efforts by public health authorities.\u201d\nNone of Friday\u2019s changes address the question of how health authorities will verify positive diagnoses to prevent trolls or other false positives, and it seems likely that question will be addressed by specific app developers. Given the wide variations in health systems internationally, engineers said they felt it was best for local authorities to develop their own verification system to align with their system for distribution tests.\nOne of the biggest lingering questions around the project is whether it will be adopted by public health agencies, and the companies gave no further details on specific partnerships. However, they said they had discussed the project with dozens of stakeholders, including public health agencies.",

        "title": "Apple's App Store is riddled with fleeceware, the latest trend in scams - Fleeceware is an app that takes advantage of a free trial, which can cost a fortune if you forget to cancel.",
        "body": "What you need to know\nA security report claims the 3.5 million people have downloaded fleeceware from the App Store.\nSophos reports that it has found more than 30 apps considered to be fleeceware.\nFleeceware is an app that uses a free trial to sucker people into downloading it, but which often has an expensive subscription if you forget to cancel.\nA report from Sophos claims that 3.5 million people have downloaded apps that are considered fleeceware from the App Store, and that it has found more than 30 such apps on iOS.\n'Fleeceware' is a new trending type of scam that's been around for a few months now. It involves you downloading an app that you think is free, usually, it comes with a free trial lasting anywhere from a week to as little as three days. At the end of the free trial, a massively inflated subscription price kicks in, and of course if you forget to cancel the free trial, or are unaware of the impending subscription cost, you could end up getting \"fleeced\" for a lot of money.\nFrom the report:\nIn this latest round of research, we found more than 30 apps we consider fleeceware in Apple's official App Store.Many of these apps charge subscription rates like $30 per month or $9 per week after a 3- or 7-day trial period. If someone kept paying that subscription for a year, it would cost $360 or $468, respectively. For an app.\n$468 a year to subscribe to an app. Worse than the price though, is the fact that fleeceware apps tend to be nonsense like horoscopes, fortune-telling, and palm readers, as well as QR code/barcode scanners and image editing apps that show you how you would look when you're 80 years old. The report continues:\nMany of the fleeceware apps we see are advertised within the App Store as \"free\" apps, which puts the apps at odds with section 2.3.2 of the App Store Review Guidelines, which require developers to make sure their \"app description, screenshots, and previews clearly indicate whether any featured items, levels, subscriptions, etc. require additional purchases.\"If you think one of these apps is free and install it, the app presents you with a \"free trial\" notification immediately upon launching the app for the first time. This notification prompts the user to provide payment card details. In some cases, most of the useful features of the app will only be usable if you sign up for the subscription. Some users may sign up to subscribe without reading the fine print, which includes the actual cost of the subscriptions.\nOne such listed app, Zodiac Master Plus, is the 11th highest-grossing app on iPhone, and the report estimates it has pulled roughly $500k in revenue. A full table of culprit apps estimates that these apps have been downloaded 3.5 million times (3.68 million to be precise), generating $4.5 million in revenue. Remember as well that in some cases, 30% of that is going to Apple. Users are often targeted by ads that encourage people to download these apps on Instagram, TikTok and more. Furthermore, many of the apps are littered with one-star reviews and complaints about high subscription prices.\nThe report questions whether these apps are flouting App Store guidelines by failing to advertise clearly that they require a paid subscription to use. Given the massive amount of money that is seemingly being generated, it would certainly appear that many people are falling for this unfortunate tactic.\nYou can manage and cancel subscriptions within the Settings app on iOS, tap on your name, then subscriptions to manage and cancel subscriptions you might have.\nYou can read Sophos' full report here.",

        "body": "Cupertino, California \u2014 Apple today announced the second-generation iPhone SE , a powerful new iPhone featuring a 4.7-inch Retina HD display, paired with Touch ID for industry-leading security. iPhone SE comes in a compact design, reinvented from the inside out, and is the most affordable iPhone. The new iPhone SE is powered by the Apple-designed A13 Bionic, the fastest chip in a smartphone, to handle the most demanding tasks. iPhone SE also features the best single-camera system ever in an iPhone, which unlocks the benefits of computational photography including Portrait mode, and is designed to withstand the elements with dust and water resistance.\niPhone SE comes in three beautiful colors \u2014 black, white and (PRODUCT)RED \u2014 and will be available for pre-order beginning Friday, April 17, starting at just $399 (US).\n\u201cThe first iPhone SE was a hit with many customers who loved its unique combination of small size, high-end performance and affordable price; the new second-generation iPhone SE builds on that great idea and improves on it in every way \u2014 including our best-ever single-camera system for great photos and videos \u2014 while still being very affordable,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. \u201ciPhone SE features the industry-leading performance of A13 Bionic that enables great battery life, takes stunning Portrait mode and Smart HDR photos, shoots amazing videos with stereo audio, is great for games and super fast web surfing, and is built with the same industry-leading security features our customers expect.

        "body": "The iPhone SE is an outstanding phone for less than $400, delivering fast performance and very good cameras in a compact design. The only thing missing is Night Mode.\nWhy you can trust Tom's Guide Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .\niPhone SE Specs Price: $399/\u00a3419\nCPU: A13 Bionic\nStorage: 64GB, 128GB, 256GB\nDisplay: 4.7 inches (1334 x 750)\nRear camera: 12MP (f/1.8)\nFront camera: 7MP (f/2.2)\nVideo recording: 4K video up to 60 fps\nWater resistance: IP67\nBattery life: Up to 13 hours video playback\nWireless charging: Yes (Qi)\nFast charging: Yes via optional 18W adapter\nSize: 5.45 x 2.65 x 0.29 inches\nWeight: 5.22 ounces\nThe iPhone SE (2020) remains a great phone for the money even though it's just been replaced. The iPhone SE (2022) doesn't change much if all you're looking for is the iPhone experience for as cheap as possible.\nThe 2020 model's older chip is less powerful and less efficient, plus doesn't offer features like 5G compatibility or Photographic Styles. You also don't get the new tougher front and back glass on this version. However, it's still got what you need if you're not bothered about the latest features.\nYou may find it difficult to find this model in stock these days, and given it'll likely have a shorter life of software support ahead of it than the new SE, you may be better off avoiding it. But the iPhone SE 2020 remains a good phone even with its successor now here.\nI just wish Apple trimmed the bezels on this phone and added a night mode for the camera. If you're wiling to spend more, the $699 iPhone 13 mini is a good alternative with a larger 5.4-inch display and 5G.\nRegardless, you can't deny that the iPhone SE 2020 remains one of the best phones you can buy for the money.\nThe iPhone SE costs $399/\u00a3419 (opens in new tab), the same price it debuted at in April 2020. The $399 model features 64GB of storage for $399, but you can upgrade to the 128GB version for $449/\u00a3469 and to 256GB for $549/\u00a3569.\nTrade in your old device when you buy the iPhone SE, and you could get as much as $120 off your new phone, lowering the price to $279. You can also check out the best iPhone SE deals to see if there are additional savings available.\nThe iPhone SE is available through all of the major carriers, including AT&T (opens in new tab), Sprint (opens in new tab), T-Mobile (opens in new tab) and Verizon (opens in new tab), as well as other carriers including Xfinity Mobile and Visible (opens in new tab).\niPhone SE 2020 review: Design and colors\nI generally like the iPhone SE\u2019s design \u2014 with one exception. On the plus side, it\u2019s a very well made handset with the same sturdy glass-and-aluminum design of the iPhone 8. There are three color options for the iPhone SE: black, white and (Product)Red. I like how the aluminum band is color matched with the back of the device.\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\nI tried out the black model, which looks and feels sleek but did pick up smudges despite the oleophobic coating. You\u2019ll probably want to opt for white if you want to hide fingerprints.\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\nAnother plus to the iPhone SE: The whole design is almost comically compact compared to the iPhone 11 Pro Max or the new iPhone 12 Pro Max. It\u2019s the difference between barely noticing a phone is in your front pocket and having it bulge out. I also didn\u2019t feel any discomfort when gaming for over 30 minutes at a time; I can\u2019t say that about my iPhone 11 Pro Max.\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\nThe iPhone SE measures 5.45 x 2.65 x 0.29 inches and weighs 5.22 ounces, which is smaller and narrower than the Google Pixel 4a but about the same weight. The Pixel 3a has a much bigger 5.81-inch edge-to-edge display with a hole punch cutout. However, unlike Google's budget phone, the iPhone SE 2020 has IP67 water resistance. That means it can be submerged in 1 meter of weather for up to 30 minutes. You also shouldn\u2019t have to worry about coffee or soda spills with this phone.\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\nUnfortunately, the bezels around the iPhone SE\u2019s screen look big and dated for a 2020 smartphone. I kept trying to zoom in on videos to no avail. I would have liked Apple to fit a larger display in the same size chassis.\nAnother issue is that Haptic touch does not work on the lock screen of the iPhone SE for some reason. Unlike other iPhones, you can't long press on notifications to expand them on the lock screen.\niPhone SE 2020 review: Touch ID\nAlthough Apple has offered Face ID on all of its newer phones for the past couple of years, the new iPhone SE 2020 uses a Touch ID sensor underneath the display for unlocking the device. This same sensor can be used for authorizing App Store downloads, Apple Pay and entering passwords.\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\nJust like I remembered, the combo Touch ID/home button worked well, and you can choose the amount of haptic feedback you prefer when you press down. The Touch ID button has a very important \u2014 and unexpected \u2014 benefit right now as many are being ordered to wear face masks in public. You can still easily unlock your iPhone SE without having to take off your mask. Face ID won\u2019t work with masks.\niPhone SE 2020 review: Display\nA 4.7-inch screen on a modern-day phone may seem antiquated, but those shopping for one of the best small phones won\u2019t be disappointed in this panel.\nI enjoyed checking out the Wonder Woman 1984 trailer on YouTube on the iPhone SE 2020\u2019s Retina Display. The superhero\u2019s gleaming red, blue and gold suit popped as she deflected bullets with her silver bracelet. The iPhone SE\u2019s screen also did a good job rendering finer details in a Tiger King scene: I could make out individual whiskers on the majestic animal\u2019s face.\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\nJust don\u2019t expect a full HD picture. The iPhone SE\u2019s display resolution is just 1334 x 750 pixels. We would prefer to see a 1080p display but it\u2019s not too bad of a trade-off.\nThe iPhone SE\u2019s screen is bright, as it\u2019s rated for 625 nits and scored an even higher 653 nits in our testing. It\u2019s just a bit dimmer than the Pixel 4a\u2019s 681 nits.\nI didn\u2019t have any issues viewing the screen outdoors when surfing the web or taking photos. The panel also supports True Tone, which means it can automatically adjust the screen\u2019s color temperature based on the ambient lighting conditions.\nBased on our tests, the iPhone SE\u2019s display reproduces 111.2% of the sRGB color gamut, which just barely beats the 105.8% from the Pixel 4a\u2019s OLED panel. The iPhone SE delivers accurate colors, too, achieving a Delta-E score of 0.2; a score of zero is perfect. The Pixel 4a\u2019s screen scored 0.29.\niPhone SE 2020 review: Cameras\nThe iPhone SE 2020\u2019s camera is so good that you\u2019d be hard pressed to tell the difference between it and the iPhone 11 in many cases. The one exception is Night mode, which the iPhone SE simply does not have.\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\nLike the iPhone 8 before it, the iPhone SE features a single 12-megapixel rear camera and a 7MP front camera. You don\u2019t get a ultra-wide angle lens like the iPhone 11 or a telephoto lens with optical zoom like the iPhone 12 Pro models. But the iPhone SE's A13 Bionic chip boosts its camera performance in several ways.\nFor instance, you can take portraits using both the back and front camera on the iPhone SE, complete with Portrait Lighting effects and the ability to control the depth of field. The iPhone SE also benefits from Smart HDR for bringing out the highlights in faces.\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\nI was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail in this iPhone SE photo of a man-made pond. You can make out the drops of water in the waterfall in the distance, and the greenery pops around the rock formations. The iPhone SE also did a great job capturing the black-and-white and orange-and-white fish in that pond, as well as the blue-green water.\nThe iPhone SE held its own against the Pixel 3a in this photo of light pink cherry blossom flowers. The iPhone SE\u2019s shot is warmer and brighter, but the Pixel 3a\u2019s image is a bit more detailed and has more contrast.\nI also give the nod to the iPhone SE here with this portrait. My skin tone looks more natural and the bokeh effect looks very convincing. The Pixel\u2019s manages to take a chunk out of the right side of my head. There is one small drawback to the iPhone SE when taking portraits, though; you have to get considerably closer to your subject than you do with the iPhone 11 Pro because the iPhone SE doesn\u2019t have a telephoto lens. (You will be within 6 feet, which is not social-distancing friendly.)\nThe iPhone SE pulled ahead in this photo of an Aperol Sprtiz cocktail. The overall image just looks brighter and more appetizing. I also like how the iPhone SE blurs out the background. The only strike against the iPhone here is that the tile looks more yellow than white; the Pixel 3a got that right.\nThe one camera weakness for the iPhone SE is the lack of a Night Mode. In this photo taken outside at night, the Pixel 3a is able to render the trees in the foreground, the car in the street and the house in the background. You can barely make out anything in the iPhone SE\u2019s shot. I don\u2019t know if the iPhone SE could pull off a Night mode with a software upgrade, but it would be great to see Apple add the feature.\nIf you're wondering how the iPhone SE's cameras measure up to a more recent device than the Pixel 3a, check out our Google Pixel 4a vs. iPhone SE face-off for a camera comparison to Google's current budget offering.\nOn the video front, the iPhone SE can record 4K video at up to 60 fps, and you can enjoy extended dynamic range if you drop down the frame rate to 30 fps. This brings out more details in the shadows along with better highlights.\niPhone SE 2020 review: Performance\nWhile Android phone makers outfit their budget phones with weaker processors, the iPhone SE packs the same A13 Bionic chip as the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. This means you\u2019ll enjoy the same fast and responsive performance.\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\nFor example, the iPhone SE delivered silky smooth gameplay while I sped along in Sayonara Wild Hearts and tried to stay on the track in Super Impossible Road. The graphics were not as crisp due to the iPhone SE\u2019s lower-res display, but the overall action was just as swift and enjoyable. Loading apps and switching between apps was also lag-free.\nScrolling on the iPhone SE feels slower than on phones with a 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate, but I don\u2019t expect that perk on a sub-$400 phone.\nOn Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, the iPhone SE scored 3,226 on the multi-core test and 1,337 on the single-core portion. Those numbers are comparable to what the iPhone 11 (3,251 and 1,331) turned in. They also beat the Galaxy S20 , which scored 3,147 and 867 and costs $600 more.\nThe iPhone SE performed very well on real-world performance tests, too. It took the phone just 43 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p after applying a few edits in the Adobe Premiere Rush app. That result actually beats the pricier Samsung Galaxy S20, which took 1 minute and 15 seconds.\nSince our testing iPhone SE review, Apple has released the iPhone 12 family, with four models powered by the faster A14 Bionic chip. Those phones outperform the iPhone SE, but make no mistake \u2014 the A13 inside Apple's cheapest iPhone still delivers a punch that tops many other devices.\niPhone SE 2020 review: Battery life and charging\nThe iPhone SE is rated for less battery life than the the iPhone 11, so you shouldn't expect the longest endurance. For instance, Apple says that the iPhone SE delivers 13 hours of video playback, versus 17 hours for the iPhone 11.\nOn the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over 4G LTE, the iPhone SE 2020 averaged 9 hours and 18 minutes. That's well below the endurance of the iPhone 11 (11:16), iPhone 11 Pro (10:24) and iPhone 11 Pro Max (11:54). The iPhone SE did, however, best the Pixel 4a, which scored a mere 8:55.\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\nIn my anecdotal testing, I found that the iPhone SE does have less staying power than my iPhone 11 Pro Max, as it has a smaller battery. For example, after unplugging the iPhone SE at 7 am and using it for web surfing, playing games, taking photos and more throughout the day, I had 20% juice left at 8 pm. That's not bad, but my iPhone 11 Pro Max still had close to 40% power.\nUnfortunately, the iPhone SE comes with Apple\u2019s standard 5-watt Lightning charger. (The bright side? Apple stopped including chargers with last fall's iPhone 12 releases.) And with that you can expect to get to just 29% power in 30 minutes, based on our testing. If you want to be able to juice this phone to 50% in 30 minutes, you\u2019re going to have to pay extra for an 18W charger from Apple. It\u2019s $29 for the power brick and another $19 for the USB C to Lightning cable.\nIf you want to go wireless, the iPhone SE supports 7.5W wireless charging and supports the Qi standard. Check out all the best wireless chargers to pair with this phone.\niPhone SE vs Google Pixel 4a\nReleased after the iPhone SE, the Google Pixel 4a is a very good alternative to Apple's phone. At $349, it costs $50 less than the iPhone SE. And for that price you get a bigger 5.8-inch OLED display, much slimmer bezels and a Night mode for the camera, which the iPhone SE lacks. The Pixel 4a also offers double the storage at 128GB vs 64GB for the iPhone.\nOn the other hand, the Snapdragon 730 processor inside the Pixel 4a is slower than Apple's A13 Bionic chip. Plus, the iPhone SE has a water resistant design, as well as wireless charging. So it really comes down to whether you prefer iOS or Android.\niPhone SE 2020 review: Verdict\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\nThe iPhone SE 2020 is the affordable iPhone to beat, and the one of the best cheap phones you can get. It\u2019s the closest thing to future-proof you\u2019ll find under $400, offering the fastest performance around, very good cameras, wireless charging and a premium design that outclasses cheap Android phones.\nYes, I wish the bezels were smaller and that Apple included Night mode for the camera \u2014 and you don\u2019t get 5G connectivity \u2014 but overall it\u2019s hard to complain too much at this price. A 5G-capable iPhone SE 3 could be on the horizon, but it likely won't arrive until 2022.\nThe iPhone XR is a tempting alternative to the iPhone SE as it now costs just $499. For that money you bet a bigger display and bigger battery but a slower CPU and less advanced cameras. If you prefer a smaller phone, however, this handset will not disappoint. Overall, the iPhone SE is the one of the best phones for those on a budget.\niPhone SE review cheat sheet: Reasons to buy and skip\nReasons to buy the iPhone SE 2020\nA13 Bionic processor: The A13 chip is the fastest in a phone and offers smooth performance, whether you're juggling multiple apps, playing games or using AR apps.\nThe A13 chip is the fastest in a phone and offers smooth performance, whether you're juggling multiple apps, playing games or using AR apps.

        "title": "Bloomberg: iPhone 12 to feature smaller notch and share design cues with iPad Pro, half-size cheaper HomePod later this year",
        "body": "Bloomberg today reports that of the four new iPhone models in the iPhone 12 lineup, at least two will feature a redesigned chassis with flat stainless steel edges, with flat sides and more sharply rounded corners like the current iPad Pro design.\nThe size of the Face ID notch is also expected to get smaller this year. Echoing previous reports, Apple is also working on a cheaper HomePod that would be about half the size of the current product. Bloomberg says the iPhone 12 and HomePod are expected to launch later this year.\nMing-Chi Kuo was first to report that the 2020 iPhones would adopt flat sides in September 2019, referencing the iPhone 4 as inspiration. Kuo also said to expect four new models, with screen sizes as large as 6.7-inch, something that Bloomberg corroborates. Only the two more expensive models will feature the LiDAR scanner, first introduced in the 2020 iPad Pro.\nIt is interesting that today\u2019s Bloomberg report though explicitly notes that the two high-end models would get the new design; it\u2019s not clear if the cheaper phones in the lineup would also get the new chassis.\nFlagship iPhone models usually launch around September, with some models shipping in October (iPhone XR) and November (iPhone X) in recent memory. The supply chain disruption as a result of the coronavirus means that Apple\u2019s original goal of launching all four iPhone 12 models simultaneously is unlikely.\nBloomberg says to expect some of the models to be released several weeks later than the usual September target.\nThe smaller notch design point is interesting in the wake of leaked iconography that also shows a notably less-wide notch area. Bloomberg says Apple is exploring ways to eliminate the notch entirely in future years.\nA cheaper HomePod is certainly welcomed. Apple\u2019s smart speaker is a great sounding music player but is very expensive compared to the competition, which offer basic audio playback and smart assistant functionality for very low prices, with products like the Amazon Echo Dot becoming popular gift items. Apple currently sells the HomePod for $299. It\u2019s not clear how much cheaper Apple is aiming with this new model. For comparison, Amazon\u2019s higher-end Amazon Echo Plus retails for around $170, although is regularly discounted below that.\nBloomberg also shares some additional details about the Apple AirTags, the upcoming Tile tracker competitor. The report says Apple\u2019s tag will come bundled with a leather sleeve and a keychain attachment. The tags themselves are described as thin, small and puck-shaped. 9to5Mac found a glyph of the device in iOS code last year. Bloomberg says the AirTag should launch sometime this year, but a more specific timeframe was not mentioned.\nThe Bloomberg reported roadmap also expects new MacBook Pro hardware, an updated Apple TV, a refresh to the entry-level iPad, and an iMac update.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "body": "Widgets have been present in iOS for years, but they're usually on a dedicated screen rather than wherever you want them to be, as with Android. Soon, however, you might have that flexibility. As part of an ongoing string of code leaks, 9to5Mac has reportedly discovered that Apple is developing a 'real' widget system for iOS 14. Codenamed \"Avocado,\" the feature would let you place widgets anywhere on your home screen as if they were app icons. The 9to5 crew warned there was a chance Apple could cut the feature (say, due to development time).\nThe news may be supported by Twitter user Dongle's recent post hinting at a new approach to wallpaper in iOS 14. Supposedly leaked screenshots of the wallpaper settings include a \"home screen appearance\" category that would allow for smart dynamic wallpapers that can be blurred, dark or flat-colored on demand. In theory, that could help widgets stand out if your usual background is too busy.\nWe wouldn't count on absolute flexibility like on Android, where you have resizable widgets and the option to place app shortcuts virtually anywhere on the home screen. If this new widget approach reaches iOS 14, though, it could go some way toward courting users who feel that iOS' home screen interface has remained largely unchanged for years.",

Apple originally planned to unveil the new AirPods Pro in May 2020, but the schedule may be pushed back, as Apple has been unable to send staff to the production lines in Asia to inspect the status of the TWS earbuds due to the coronavirus outbreak, the sources noted. But Apple so far has not yet made any adjustments to the earbuds' release schedule, the sources said.\nThe report refers to the earphones as new AirPods Pro, but it is quite possible these could end up being regular third-generation AirPods.\nThe current lineup includes second-generation AirPods with a wired charging case for $159, second-generation AirPods with a wireless charging case for $199, and AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case for $249.\nOver the weekend, leaker Jon Prosser said new AirPods are \"ready to go\" and will \"probably\" launch next month.",

        "body": "The \"Parks and Recreation\" cast returns Thursday for a reunion special that was shot on iPhone. | Source: NBC\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nPopular NBC sitcom \"Parks and Recreation,\" which last aired in 2015, is set to broadcast a special reunion episode this week to raise funds in aid of coronavirus response efforts, with the half-hour show filmed entirely on iPhone.\nAs can be expected, coordinating the scripted event while much of the U.S. is under strict quarantine orders was \"very difficult,\" \"Parks and Recreation\" co-creator Mike Schur told Variety.\nFirst Schur contacted a handful of writers from the show, who wrote the script in less than three days, then the team sent a \"little rig with a tripod,\" iPhone, light and microphones to cast members. Directors and executive producers Morgan Sackett and Dean Holland, along with script supervisor Valeria Collins, helped develop the episode.\nSchur and the ad-hoc production group directed and helped actors with camera framing and adjustments over Zoom. \"The Good Place\" graphics and effects team was also enlisted \"to make it not look like everyone was just sitting alone in their houses staring at a computer,\" Schur said.\nThe episode was shot in four days.\nWhile iPhone helped make the reunion episode a reality, Schur does not believe the process represents a shift in how television is made.\n\"Is there anything about this that points the way forward for TV production? And the answer is a resounding no,\" Schur said. \"For me, this is not the way TV is be supposed to be made. It required an incredible amount of basically goodwill volunteer work, or guild minimum, union minimum volunteer work from from sound designers and editors and supervisors and all sorts of people really just doing it, because it's a fundraiser, because it was fun to get the cast back together. But, you know, TV is a team sport. From the very beginning to the very end, it's about groups of people functioning in holistic ways with each other, and collaborating and being in the same room at the same time. And, you know, I don't think there's any way that this is a sustainable method for making television.\"\nThe special stars many of the show's original cast including Amy Poehler , Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Pratt, Adam Scott, Rob Lowe, Jim O'Heir, and Retta. Guest stars will also make appearances.\nSchur said he \"didn't think that Parks and Rec' was ever going to reunite,\" but the ongoing coronavirus pandemic presented a \"compelling reason\" to bring the cast back together. Proceeds from the special will go toward Feeding America's COVID-19 Response Fund.\nNBC will air the \"Parks and Recreation\" special on Thursday.",

        "title": "Germany flips to Apple-Google approach on smartphone contact tracing",
        "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany changed course on Sunday over which type of smartphone technology it wanted to use to trace coronavirus infections, backing an approach supported by Apple and Google along with a growing number of other European countries.\nFILE PHOTO: A sign with distancing rules and the notice that masks must be worn, is seen at the entrance of a shop, as the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues in Erfurt, Germany, April 24, 2020. REUTERS/Karina Hessland\nCountries are rushing to develop apps to give a detailed picture of the risk of catching the coronavirus, as the chain of infection is proving hard to break because it can be spread by those showing no symptoms.\nChancellery Minister Helge Braun and Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a joint statement that Berlin would adopt a \u201cdecentralised\u201d approach to digital contact tracing, thus abandoning a home-grown alternative that would have given health authorities central control over tracing data.\nIn Europe, most countries have chosen short-range Bluetooth \u201chandshakes\u201d between mobile devices as the best way of registering a potential contact, even though it does not provide location data.\nBut they have disagreed about whether to log such contacts on individual devices or on a central server - which would be more directly useful to existing contact tracing teams that work phones and knock on doors to warn those who may be at risk.\nUnder the decentralised approach, users could opt to share their phone number or details of their symptoms - making it easier for health authorities to get in touch and give advice on the best course of action in the event they are found to be at risk.\nThis consent would be given in the app, however, and not be part of the system\u2019s central architecture.\nAPPLE REFUSED TO BUDGE\nGermany as recently as Friday backed a centralised standard called Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT), which would have needed Apple in particular to change the settings on its iPhones.\nWhen Apple refused to budge there was no alternative but to change course, said a senior government source.\nIn their joint statement, Braun and Spahn said Germany would now adopt a \u201cstrongly decentralised\u201d approach.\n\u201cThis app should be voluntary, meet data protection standards and guarantee a high level of IT security,\u201d they said. \u201cThe main epidemiological goal is to recognise and break chains of infection as soon as possible.\u201d\nBluetooth-based smartphone contact tracing operates by assessing the closeness and length of contact between people and, if a person tests positive for COVID-19, telling recent contacts to call a doctor, get tested or self-isolate.\nEarly results in countries such as Singapore are modest, however, especially when set against the technology\u2019s potential to redefine the relationship between state and individual.\nAn open letter from hundreds of scientists published last Monday warned that, if the contact tracing data was centralised, it would allow \u201cunprecedented surveillance of society at large\u201d.\nThe tide was already running against PEPP-PT and its main backer, German tech entrepreneur Chris Boos, as collaborators pulled out, faulting its methodology and its slowness to open up its work to wider scrutiny.\n\u201cGRAVE ERRORS\u201d\nOne of the members of PEPP-PT, Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer HHI research institute, was told on Saturday that it had been taken off the project, correspondence seen by Reuters showed.\n\u201cA series of grave errors were made by PEPP-PT regarding communication that, at the end of the day, caused serious damage and led to this decision,\u201d Fraunhofer HHI head Thomas Wiegand said in a message to colleagues.\nGermany\u2019s reversal brings it into line with a proposal by Apple and Google, who said this month they would develop new tools to support decentralised contact tracing. In Europe, France and Britain still back centralisation.\nCentralised apps would not work properly on Apple\u2019s iPhone because, for Bluetooth exchanges to happen, the device would need to be unlocked with the app running in the foreground - a drain on the battery and an inconvenience to the user.\nBut the iPhone will integrate with decentralised protocols such as DP-3T, which has been developed by a Swiss-led team and has been backed by Switzerland, Austria and Estonia.\nBackers of DP-3T, short for Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing, say it is still possible for users voluntarily to opt in to sharing their phone number in order to pass epidemiologically useful data - although not location - to authorities to aid contact tracing. But this would be part of an app, not of the system architecture.\nDP-3T, in a statement, welcomed Germany\u2019s change of heart. PEPP-PT did not respond to requests for comment.",
