        "title": "Nintendo to start making games for iOS",
        "body": "As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Nintendo has finally decided that it is time to start making mobile games for platforms like the iPhone. The company has confirmed it will begin developing titles for smartphones and other mobile devices (presumably, \u2018tablets\u2019) featuring famous franchises like Mario.\nUntil now, Nintendo has been resistant to share its first-party intellectual property (\u2018IP\u2019) outside of its own consoles. Clearly, it was worried that bringing characters like Mario to the iPhone would cannabilize sales of its own hardware like the Nintendo DS. However, as part of a new partnership with a mobile gaming company, there has clearly been a change of heart by Nintendo executives.\nAccording to the report, Nintendo wants to create a gaming membership service that would span smartphone, and traditional games consoles. It\u2019s unclear how this would work on Apple\u2019s platforms in conjunction with the App Store rules on In-App Purchases. The games would be \u2018new experiences\u2019, not simply ports of existing Wii U and DS titles.\nNintendo says it is still working on its own first-party console hardware, but is now committed to providing great mobile gaming experiences as well. Although the public is unlikely to see any fruits of this new direction for many months, it will no doubt excite Nintendo fans about the possibilities of getting full titles on their favorite devices, the iPhone and iPad.\nThe Pokemon Company has already dabbled with iPad games, so fingers crossed for a full Pokemon game coming to iOS soon as well.\nThe change of heart is rather amusing for the struggling games company, which has been losing out to Microsoft and Sony in the console space and Apple for general mobile device dominance. Satoru Iwata, Nintendo president, has historically said that Nintendo would never make mobile games as long as he in charge, despite investor pressure.\nConsumers generally still seem to enjoy the Nintendo franchises, myself included, so maybe Nintendo can make a comeback as a games developer for iOS. And although Nintendo has said it is developing new console hardware, codenamed \u2018NX\u2019, it is likely to continue to struggle in that space against the likes of Apple \u2026 especially when the Apple TV with integrated games store debuts.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

The video compares it to iOS 3 running on the original iPhone.\nWhile William Van Hecke believed that the issue was that animations used to be interruptible, this isn\u2019t actually the case except for Springboard. In other cases, iOS has always ignored input until animations are complete, it\u2019s just that they used to be shorter. If you\u2019re fast with your fingers, there will now be times when you\u2019re trying to do something while the animation is still doing its thing.\nThe new spring-based animations also make it less clear when the animation has ended, so the device seems unresponsive to input, but in reality it\u2019s that the animation hasn\u2019t quite finished.\nDo you see this as an issue in real-life use?

In this search we discovered an interesting factoid; the logic board of the MacBook is actually smaller than the famous Raspberry Pi.\nHow\u2019d we reach this conclusion? Well, we know the size of the system according to Apple, and we have photos of the logic board provided by Apple. By comparing the size of the chassis in pixels to the known specifications, comparing the logic board in the same way, and using some math, we\u2019re able to approximate the size. By our calculations, the logic board is 4.6 inches wide and 1.5 inches deep, rounding to the nearest tenth, and not counting a tiny sliver of circuit board that protrudes on one side.\nMultiply those figures and you come up with a surface area of about seven inches, given or take a tenth depending on how precisely the pixels are measured.\nMeanwhile, the Raspberry Pi measures about 3.4 inches by 2.2 inches (rounding to the nearest tenth). That works out to 7.48 square inches, a full quarter of a square inch larger than the MacBook\u2019s logic board. The Pi is also about eight-tenths of an inch thick, which works out to around 20 millimeters, seven more than the 13.1 millimeter MacBook.\nObviously, the logic board of the MacBook and the Raspberry Pi are not comparable from a marketing standpoint, and are meant to fill different roles, but it\u2019s impressive that Apple has managed to fit so much in so little space.\nToday's tech news, curated and condensed for your inbox Subscribe Check your inbox!

The report, citing sources familiar with the plans, claims that the new Apple TV will be a \"significant overhaul\" of the streaming TV box, featuring both Siri and an App Store with an SDK available for developers to create apps.\nThe new Apple TV will feature Apple's latest A8 system-on-a-chip and a \"dramatic increase\" in internal storage, well beyond the 8GB included in the current third-generation set-top box. The addition of Siri will enable Apple TV owners to control a wide selection of HomeKit-enabled home automation devices through the set-top box, according to the report.\nThe new Apple TV will be part of Apple's ambitious plans to improve the TV experience, an area that iTunes chief Eddy Cue thinks \"sucks\" currently and Apple chief executive Tim Cook referred to as \"stuck back in the 70s\" in an interview with Charlie Rose last year. The new device will be Apple's attempt at capturing the digital living room through TV, music, apps and home automation amid a sea of competitors including Amazon, Google and Roku.\nA refreshed Apple TV would make sense given reports that Apple is also planning to announce its oft-rumored streaming TV service at WWDC, anchored by popular networks such as ABC, CBS, Fox, ESPN and FX. The web-based TV service for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and other devices is expected to deliver a lightweight package of about 25 channels for between $30 to $40 per month. Apple TV is also long overdue for a hardware refresh, with the set-top box last updated in 2012.",

        "title": "Don't even try to compete with Apple at this point - Apple gold: Apple has a patent that \"allows them to make 18k gold that has, on a volume basis, less gold than regular 18k gold.\"",
        "body": "Next post Previous post\nTwitter user Sumocat got some blowback for this tweet:\n@marco_org Apple has a patent that can reduce the gold content of their 18k gold by half. veg.gy/ZhMF2\nIt\u2019s inartfully put (140 characters is a bitch), but as a practical matter he\u2019s correct. Apple\u2019s patent application is for a method that allows them to make 18k gold that has, on a volume basis, less gold than regular 18k gold.\nHow can this be? It\u2019s because Apple\u2019s gold is a metal matrix composite, not a standard alloy. Instead of mixing the gold with silver, copper, or other metals to make it harder, Apple is mixing it with low-density ceramic particles. The ceramic makes Apple\u2019s gold harder and more scratch-resistant\u2014which Tim Cook touted during the September announcement\u2014and it also makes it less dense overall.\nThe karat measure of gold is based on the mass fraction. One hundred grams of 18k gold has 75 grams of gold and 25 grams of other material. If that \u201cother material\u201d is a low-density ceramic, it takes up a bigger volume than if it\u2019s a high-density metal. Because the casing of a watch is made to a particular size (i.e. volume), not to a particular weight, the \uf8ffWatch will have less gold in it than an 18k case made of a conventional alloy.\nAs an example, assume a conventional 18k gold alloy with 75% gold (19.3 g/cc), 15% silver (10.5 g/cc), and 10% copper (8.96 g/cc) by weight. The alloy will have a density of\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\frac{0.75}{19.3} + \\frac{0.15}{10.5} + \\frac{0.10}{8.96}} = 15.6\\;\\mathrm{g/cc}\\]\nA cubic centimeter of this alloy will contain\n\\[0.75 \\times 15.6 = 11.7\\;\\mathrm{g}\\]\nof gold.\nNow assume an 18k gold with 75% gold and 25% boron carbide by weight (that\u2019s one of the ceramics mentioned in Apple\u2019s patent). Boron carbide has a density of 2.52 g/cc, so a gold/boron carbide metal matrix composite would have a density of about\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\frac{0.75}{19.3} + \\frac{0.25}{2.52}} = 7.24\\;\\mathrm{g/cc}\\]\nA cubic centimeter of this material will contain only\n\\[0.75 \\times 7.24 = 5.43\\;\\mathrm{g}\\]\nof gold. Here, the gold takes up\n\\[\\frac{5.43\\;\\mathrm{g}}{19.3\\;\\mathrm{g/cc}} = 0.28\\;\\mathrm{cc}\\]\nor 28% of the volume.\nTable 1 of Apple\u2019s patent gives other configurations and shows the gold savings.\nSome of these numbers look flatly wrong to me. For example, changing from a baseline of 25.8 g of gold in a particular part to 12.1 g is not a savings of 43%, it\u2019s a savings of 53%. Maybe I\u2019m reading the table wrong.\nIn any event, the patent makes it clear that saving gold is one of the goals of the process. I suppose it\u2019s not surprising that Tim didn\u2019t make a big deal out of that in September.\nNext post Previous post",

What made the event all the more exciting is that Apple was successfully able to keep important details of the device completely under wraps.\nIn a broad sense, sure, we knew Apple was likely to introduce a wearable device of some sort. But key details surrounding the device\u2019s capabilities, and even what the design looked like, remained unknown until Tim Cook officially walked up on stage and unveiled the Apple Watch for the first time.\nDon\u2019t Miss: The smartwatch market is dead, but Apple can save it\nThat said, one has to wonder how Apple was successfully able to keep the Apple Watch design a secret for the entirety of the development process, an impressive feat given the insatiable appetite the tech masses have for Apple rumors and product leaks. After all, employees on the Apple Watch team had to wear the device out in public for field testing.\nTo that end, The New York Times recently revealed how Apple was able to accomplish that while not tipping its hand.\nIn an effort to maintain secrecy, engineers testing the watch outside the office even created fake casing[s] that made the Apple device resemble a Samsung watch, one person said.\nIt\u2019s sort of amusing to imagine the most talented of Apple engineers skipping around town wearing what ostensibly appeared to be clunky Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatches.\nIn any event, Apple has a long history of field testing mobile devices in disguise. If you recall, the now infamous iPhone 4 prototype that Gizmodo paid a few grand for was dressed up in a modified case to make it resemble an iPhone 3GS. This provided Apple engineers who were responsible for testing and calibrating the device\u2019s cellular functionality the ability to do so in public without arousing the slightest bit of interest or suspicion.\nWhile other tech companies are notorious for openly discussing or even leaking upcoming product plans and key features, Apple keeps its products plans a closely guarded secret; even if it means dressing up an unreleased product to look like a device from a chief competitor.",

        "body": "Source: USPTO\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nAn Apple patent published on Tuesday details a miniaturized iPhone camera system that employs a light-splitting cube to parse incoming rays into three color components, each of which are captured by separate sensors.\nAs granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Apple's U.S Patent No. 8,988,564 for a \"Digital camera with light splitter\" examines the possibilities of embedding a three-sensor prism-based camera module within the chassis of a thin wireless device, such as an iPhone. Light splitting systems do not require color channel processing or demosaicing, thereby maximizing pixel array resolution.\nCommonly found in prosumer video cameras, and more recently in handheld camcorder models, three-sensor imaging technology splits incident light entering a camera into three wavelengths, or colors, using a prism or prisms. Usually identified as red, green and blue, the split images are picked up by dedicated imaging sensors normally arranged on or close to the prism face.\nOlder three-CCD cameras relied on the tech to more accurately capture light and negate the \"wobble\" effect seen with a single energy-efficient CMOS chip. Modern equipment employs global shutter CMOS modules that offer better low-light performance and comparable color accuracy, opening the door to entirely new shooting possibilities.\nApple's design uses light splitting techniques similar to those applied in current optics packages marketed by Canon, Panasonic, Philips and other big-name players in the camera space. For its splitter assembly, Apple uses a cube arrangement constructed using four identical polyhedrons that meet at dichroic interfaces.\nBy coating each interface with an optical coating, particular wavelengths of incident light can be reflected or allowed to transmit through to an adjoining tetrahedron. Adjusting dichroic filters allows Apple to parse out red, green and blue wavelengths and send them off to three sensors positioned around the cube. Aside from RGB, the patent also allows for other color sets like cyan, yellow, green and magenta (CYGM) and red, green, blue and emerald (RGBE), among others.\nLight splitters also enable other desirable effects like sum and difference polarization, which achieves the same results as polarization imaging without filtering out incident light. The process can be taken a step further to enhance image data for feature extraction, useful in computer vision applications.\nInfrared imaging can also benefit from a multi-sensor setup, as the cube can be tuned to suppress visible wavelength components, or vice versa.\nTuesday's patent is an extension of a previously published Apple invention that uses mirrors and optics to achieve optical image stabilization without eating up valuable space. In such embodiments a foldable, or mobile, mirror redirects incoming light, bouncing it toward a rectangular tube that terminates with a cuboid light splitter. In between the mirror and sensor package are a series of lenses that can be operably moved for focus and zooming. Motors are applied to vary the mirror's angle to offset hand shake recorded by onboard sensors.\nIt is unclear if Apple intends to implement a light splitter into a future product, though the company is working hard to keep iPhone at the fore of ultra-mobile photography. For example, the latest iPhone 6 Plus includes an OIS system that produces sharp images even in low-light situations.",

        "body": "Apple will introduce several major initiatives to ready its retail stores for the Apple Watch\u2019s launch in April, according to sources briefed on the upcoming changes. Starting on April 10th, Apple will allocate 15 minutes per customer for in-store try-on appointments, using 10 or more try-on stations to manage what\u2019s expected to be a steady flow of customers interested in having hands-on time with the Watch. While customers will not necessarily be required to have an appointment, they will be time-limited and guided during the hands-on experience. Additionally, they will be given the opportunity to place a reservation at the time of try-on for a particular model, and make a follow-up appointment to pick the watch up during the April 24th launch date. Stores will also have launch day stock for walk-in appointments.\nEach Apple Store will be provided with a special-hands on table filled with Apple Watch demo units, as Apple announced at its keynote earlier this month. Most stores will be provided one table with at least 10 surrounding Apple Watch try-on stations, while some Apple Stores will be given more tables to meet demand. Apple Stores will begin setting up the Apple Watch tables on April 9th and 10th during special overnight sessions for employees. Employees will also begin a few hours of more extensive Apple Watch training in the coming days, a follow-up to secretive training some employees received before the Spring Forward event at locations in Cupertino, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta.\nTo offer more personalized attention for certain Apple Watch customers, Apple will split its retail staff into four \u201czones\u201d when hands-on trials and sales begin. The first set of retail employees will be stationed at the Apple Watch try-on areas to assist customers in trying on the aluminum Apple Watch Sport or stainless steel Apple Watch. A second zone is for sales, and will include two lines: one for people who know exactly which Apple Watch they want to purchase, and another for those who still are undecided about the right watch casing and band choice. The third group of employees will answer general questions about the Watch\u2019s functionality and explain features.\nFinally, a special fourth group of employees will be dedicated to assisting buyers of the gold Apple Watch Edition models. This group of employees will be made up of \u201cExperts,\u201d Apple Store employees who have worked at the company for an extensive period of time and have completed extra customer service training. A pair of \u201cExperts\u201d from each Apple Store in the Apple Watch launch countries were taught additional sales methods and customer service techniques for the Apple Watch Edition at the aforementioned February training sessions. The Apple Watch Edition starts at $10,000 and will be sold in limited quantities at select Apple Store locations.\nDuring the preview sessions beginning on April 10th, between 75% and 90% of store retail staff will be allocated to assisting customers with the Apple Watch. The amount of employees allocated to Apple Watch sales will differ daily based on store Apple Watch inventory numbers, according to the sources. Apple has also considered utilizing the same new text-message based appointments system as its Genius Bar to organize Apple Watch try-on appointments. This would allow a person without a pre-scheduled time to receive a text message as a walk-in appointment when there is time for them to view the Watch. However, it is not yet confirmed if Apple will use this approach from the beginning for the Watch.\nWith the Apple Watch\u2019s launch approaching, Apple has already begun promoting the device in stores with large banners with images similar to those on Apple\u2019s website and in a recent issue of Vogue magazine. While these details provide insight into how Apple Store Watch sales will be structured, we also previously reported on Apple\u2019s sales pitch for the device. According to sources, Apple will utilize a soft-shell sales approach that focuses on the device\u2019s three key features (Health & Fitness, Communicating, and Timekeeping), bands and accessories, and iPhone hardware upgrades. Apple, as soon as next week, will launch a new trade-in program for Android users to more easily upgrade to iPhones compatible with the Apple Watch.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "Microsoft Office for Mac 2015 release date rumours: new Office coming this year",
        "body": "You can run Microsoft Office, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook on a Mac (and on your iPad or iPhone). But it\u2019s not a simple case of installing the application you need and starting to type. You need to choose whether to sign up to a subscription or buy the full version outright. You need to decide whether you need just one application or all of them. And, if you are choosing a subscription package, you need to determine what kind of subscription applies to you.\nThere are multiple ways in which you can get the Office apps on your Mac. We\u2019ll help you figure out which version of Office for Mac is the right one for you in our complete guide to buying Microsoft Office for Mac.\nIf you aren\u2019t sure whether to choose the Microsoft Office apps or some free, or cheaper alternatives take a look at our Best Word Processors for Mac and Best Email apps for Mac articles.\nHow to buy Microsoft Office for Mac\nThere is more than one way to buy Microsoft Office for Mac. You can subscribe to Microsoft 365 on a monthly or yearly basis, or you can buy the software outright.\nThe latest version of Office for Mac is available via a Microsoft 365 subscription (from $69.99/\u00a359.99 per year or $6.99/\u00a35.99 per month). If you subscribe you benefit from the fact that you always receive the latest updates to the software, continuously, without the need of having to buy the whole program or suite again. The service, previously called Office 365, rebranded as Microsoft 365 in April 2020. Despite the name change and a bunch of upgrades at that time, the prices remain the same.\nIf you don\u2019t want to sign up for a subscription and would rather own the software outright, you will be glad to hear that Microsoft continues to sell and update the Office 2021 suite. The latest version of Office for Mac for home users is Office Home & Student 2021 ($149.99/\u00a3119.99). It includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint.\nThere is also Office Home & Business 2021 ($249.99/\u00a3249.99) which is designed for families and small businesses who want the office apps Word, Excel, PowerPoint as well as Outlook. Read about Microsoft Office for Mac 2021 in our guide to the latest version of Office.\nRight now you can get big savings on Microsoft Office Home & Business for Mac 2021. It costs $49.99 at the Macworld Shop, it normally costs $249.\nGet Microsoft Office Home & Business for Mac 2021 for $49.99\nMicrosoft also offers Office LTSC (Long Term Servicing Channel). Details of how to upgrade to that are on Microsoft\u2019s site here. Microsoft 365 subscribers get updates every month (though organizational subscriptions can choose to upgrade user accounts either semi-annually, every January and July).\nWhat is the latest version of Office for Mac?\nIf you buy the software outright the latest version is Office 2021.\nIf you subscribe your version of Microsoft 365 your version of Office will be regularly updated with new features. You can check which version is the most current and the latest features on Microsoft\u2019s website here. For example, in May 2022 Microsoft added the ability to access a wider range of data with the Power Query Editor.\nBoth versions receive security and performance updates. You can find details of the latest version on Microsoft\u2019s website:\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Microsoft 365 and Office 2021?\nOffice 2021 for Mac was launched in September 2021 (three years after Office 2019 launched). However, some of the new features had already been available as part of the Microsoft 365 (previously Office 365) subscription.\nWith Microsoft 365, customers pay monthly or yearly to always have the most up to date version of the software. There are various packages depending on whether you will be the only person using the software, if you will be sharing the subscription with friends and family, or if you are a small business or a larger enterprise.\nThe subscription system suits some users, but others prefer to pay for software outright and know that they will own it for eternity. Hence, Microsoft also allows you to buy the full Office 2021 suite for a one-off payment. That licence will never run out, although Microsoft might eventually stop support for that version.\nAs far as stand-alone software go, you can either pick up Office Home & Student 2021 ($149.99/\u00a3119.99), Office Home & Business 2021 ($249.99/\u00a3249.99/) or opt for the Office LTSC if you are buying for a business or to use commercially (in which case you will find details on Microsoft\u2019s site here.\nYou can also buy the apps individually, more on that below.\nThere is also a free cloud-based version of Office that you can access online via a web browser. Think of it as a Lite version of the paid versions of the app. You still need to sign up for a Microsoft Account.\nHome/small business use: Office 2021 vs Microsoft 365\nOffice Home & Student 2021 and Office Home & Business 2021 Microsoft 365 (Family or Personal) Pay once Pay monthly or yearly. Stop paying and you lose the license. Includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint. (Works with Microsoft Teams). Office Home & Business 2021 also include Outlook. Includes the most up to date version of Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook. No services included. Skype and One Drive included. Family: 6TB (1TB for each person); Personal: 1TB. OneDrive Personal Vault security. Runs on one Mac or one PC. Runs on Mac, PC, iOS & Android. One person. Personal: One person; Family: Six people. Includes security updates, but no feature updates. Microsoft will update the apps with new features. Install on one Mac or PC. Install on all your devices (iPad, iPhone, Mac). Depending on your subscription package you may be able to share your subscription with five others. You get basic versions of the mobile apps that can be used on iPhones and iPads (as long as the iPad is under 10.1in \u2013 so iPad mini only). You get free versions of the mobile apps with extra features that aren\u2019t available in the basic versions. No online storage. 1TB of cloud storage in OneDrive, to be used by up to 6 users depending on your subscription package. Installation help. Support for first 60 days at no extra cost. Ongoing technical help.\nBusiness use: Microsoft 365 for Business vs Office LTSC\nIf you are a enterprise user you need to consider a version designed for deploying to businesses. With the 2021 version of Office Microsoft has added Office LTSC as an option.\nOffice LTSC\nThis version of Office 2021 is available to volume licence customers who just want to make a one-time purchase, rather than subscribing to Microsoft 365. It includes the same apps as the Home & Business version of Office Home & Business 2021, but, Mac users also get Outlook LTSC (PC users also get Access and Publisher LTSC versions).\nThe price is 10% more than the Office Home & Business 2021 version, and will depend on how many Macs or PCs are being deployed to.\nMicrosoft 365 for Business\nThere are also Microsoft 365 subscription packages for businesses and enterprises. Each is charged per user/per month and there are lower monthly prices if you sign up for an annual commitment.\nMicrosoft 365 Business Basic (formerly Office 365 Business Essentials) is the cheapest option at \u00a33.80/$5 per user per month. It includes only web and mobile versions of the Office apps. Subscribers also get access to OneDrive, Exchange, SharePoint and Teams.\nMicrosoft 365 Apps for Business provides app access only and access to OneDrive. You get the desktop versions as well but not the added services around the software such as Teams or threat protection. It costs $8.25/\u00a37.90 per user per month.\nMicrosoft 365 Business Standard (formerly Office 365 Business Premium) includes Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook (plus Access on a PC), along with business email, Microsoft Teams access and cloud storage via OneDrive. This tier costs $12.50/\u00a39.40 per user per month.\nOffice 365 Business Premium (formerly Microsoft 365 Business) includes everything you get in the Business Standard option plus cyber-threat protection. This is the most expensive at $20/\u00a315.10 per user per month.\nHead to Microsoft now to compare its plans for business.\nHow much does Microsoft 365 for Mac cost?\nWith so many options around, the pricing varies depending on the type of license you want and how you want to pay. We\u2019ve broken it all down in our table below.\nMicrosoft 365 prices\nSubscription type Annual cost Monthly cost Max number of users Microsoft 365 Personal $69.99/year (\u00a359.99/year) $6.99/month (\u00a35.99/month) One person Microsoft 365 Family $99.99/year (\u00a379.99/year) $9.99/month ( \u00a37.99/month) Up to six people Microsoft 365 Business Basic \u2013 $5 per user month (\u00a33.80 per user per month) for a year Per user Microsoft 365 Apps for business \u2013 $8.25 per user per month (\u00a37.90 per user per month) for a year) Per user Office 365 Business Standard \u2013 $12.50 per user per month (\u00a39.40 per user per month) for a year Per user Microsoft 365 Business Premium $20 per user per month (\u00a315.10 per user month) for a year) Per user\nOffice 2021 prices\nIf you are a PC user there is also Office Professional 2021 for $439/\u00a3419, but there is no Mac version of this suite. More information here.\nCheapest way to get Microsoft Office\nAs you can see from the above, there are various ways to get Office, or single programs from the Office suite, on your Mac. You could subscribe for the time you need access to the software and then cancel your subscription. That way you could get the basic version of Office for Mac for $6.99/\u00a35.99/month and cancel after 30 days. Beware that you may lose access to your data though. After you cancel, you can still use Office in View Only mode.\nSpeaking of View Only mode, this mode is handy if you just want to be able to read Word documents or PowerPoint slides. In this mode you can view, but not edit. That may be all you need to do, in which case this is the cheapest option \u2013 because it\u2019s free.\nIf you do need to be able to edit documents another option is to open them in Apple\u2019s iWork apps. Apple has a word processor called Pages that can open Word documents, Keynote for PowerPoint presentations, and Numbers for Excel. These options will enable you to open and edit the Office documents and save them in the Office format, without ever having to open Office. Sometimes the formatting can be out slightly, but it\u2019s a great solution. And crucially it won\u2019t cost you anything because these apps are free for Mac users.\nIf all you need is Word, for example, you don\u2019t have to buy all the Office apps. As you can see from the table above, it is possible to buy Word, Excel and PowerPoint separately. At around $150/\u00a3150 a pop, it could be a good solution if you don\u2019t want to pay more to get the other apps that are included in the suite.\nWe also have this article about how to get Microsoft Word for free.\nShould I buy Office 365 or Office 2021?\nIf you subscribe to Microsoft 365 Personal for two years you\u2019d spend $139.98/\u00a3119.98. That\u2019s essentially the same outlay as buying the software outright.\nOf course, there are plenty of disadvantages in this scenario too. Office 365 subscribers will benefit from new feature updates throughout those two years, meaning that you will miss out on some great new tools. You may benefit from technical support that you get with a 365 subscription. Perhaps you need to have access to the iOS and Android versions of the software. We have this article about getting Office apps for free on iPad.\nAnother factor that may sway your decision is that Microsoft will stop mainstream support for Mac versions of Office Home & Student 2021 as well as Home & Business 2021 in October 2026 (which means Microsoft is only supporting it for five years, rather than the usual ten). This means that it will no longer receive security or non-security updates, such as changes to features or design. If that\u2019s a concern for you, you might prefer a subscription.\nWill my Mac run Microsoft 365 or Office 2021 for Mac?\nIn terms of system requirements, both Microsoft 365 and Office 2021 will operate on macOS Monterey, Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave and High Sierra (Microsoft will always endeavour to support the current and two previous versions of macOS). Mac users will need at least 10GB of disk space.\nOne thing to note is that older, 32-bit versions of Office, such as Office 2011, will not work on Macs running Catalina or later. To find out whether your version is 64 bit click on the Apple icon in your menu and choose About This Mac, then System Report. Scroll down to Software and choose Applications. If any of your apps are 32-bit you will see that information here.\nAnother compatibility issue is with M1 Macs. Soon after the arrival of the M1 Macs in November 2020 Microsoft made sure that Office worked natively on the M1 Chip. Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and OneNote all work on the M1 Macs. Microsoft 365 users would have had the new version of the software update automatically. Should compatibility issues come up again in the future you may have to wait longer for an update if you aren\u2019t a Microsoft subscriber.

We are deeply disappointed in Indiana's new law and calling on Arkansas Gov. to veto the similar #HB1228. \u2014 Tim Cook (@tim_cook) March 27, 2015\nThe religious freedom legislation that was approved by Pence on Thursday could let businesses turn away gay and lesbian customers by citing \"religious freedom.\" The approval of the bill has earned Indiana national attention, and much of it has been negative, with organizations and companies throughout the United States vowing to stop supporting the state.\nSenate Bill 101 prohibits state or local governments from substantially burdening a person's ability to exercise their religion -- unless the government can show that it has a compelling interest and that the action is the least-restrictive means of achieving it. It takes effect July 1.\nAlong with Apple's condemnation, the NCAA has questioned the impact the legislation will have on future sporting events, Salesforce has vowed to halt expansion plans in the state, several conventions typically held in Indiana have said they will find other venues, and San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee spoke out against the decision and barred all non-essential publicly funded City employee travel to the state.\nIn his tweets, Cook also called for Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson to veto H.B.1228, a similar bill that was recently passed by the Arkansas state senate, and he reiterated Apple's own commitment to equality and its efforts to treat every customer the same, regardless of \"how they worship or who they love.\"\nAround the world, we strive to treat every customer the same \u2014 regardless of where they come from, how they worship or who they love. \u2014 Tim Cook (@tim_cook) March 27, 2015\nCook came out as gay last October, but even before then, he's had a long history of supporting equality and speaking out against discrimination. In 2013, he lectured on equality at his alma mater Auburn University, and during that same year, both he and Apple publicly supported the Employment Nondiscrimination Act.\nUnder his direction, Apple released a statement in support of Supreme Court gay marriage rulings, and Cook also led Apple to march in support of the LGBT community during the 44th annual Pride parade in San Francisco.",

        "body": "Need to run Windows 10 on a Mac? You can install and run Windows 10 in Mac OS X for free using VirtualBox and the Windows 10 Preview from Microsoft. Because this installs Windows into a virtual machine atop existing Mac system software, running Windows is basically like running any other application, which makes it much easier than configuring Boot Camp for a native Windows experience.\nSetting up Windows 10 to run on the Mac is quite simple and requirements are basic enough, though the more resources the computer has the better the overall experience will be.\nTo get started, you\u2019ll first need to download Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft and get VirtualBox. The rest is just a matter of following the simple instructions, and soon you\u2019ll have Windows running in MacOS X in no time.\nDownload VirtualBox from Oracle (free) \u2013 install this as like any other app\nDownload Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft (free) \u2013 put this somewhere easy to locate, like the Mac Desktop (here and here are additional Windows 10 ISO links from MSFT if needed)\nAt least 8GB of disk space to install Windows into the virtual machine\nA reasonably speedy computer with sufficient RAM and CPU (the newer the better, as usual)\nA quick side note: VirtualBox is cross platform compatible, and while we\u2019re demonstrating installing Windows 10 in Mac OS Catalina, macOS Mojave, MacOS Sierra, Mac OS X High Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite here, you can actually run through this exact tutorial on any other major operating system as well outside of the Mac. Essentially this means you can run Windows 10 in Mac OS X (High Sierra, Yosemite, Mavericks, you name it), Windows 7, or even Linux, using the exact same software and instructions, nifty huh?\nHow to Run Windows 10 on Mac with VirtualBox for Mac OS X\nNow that you\u2019ve got the software components necessary to run Windows 10 in a virtual machine, let\u2019s run through the installation process:\nOpen VirtualBox and click on the \u201cNew\u201d button to build a new virtual machine Name the new virtual machine \u201cWindows 10 VM\u201d (or something equally obvious), select \u201cMicrosoft Windows\u201d as the type and choose \u201cWindows 10\u201d as the version, then choose Continue Select to create a new virtual hard drive, then choose Continue again Back at the primary VirtualBox screen, choose \u201cStart\u201d to boot the new Windows 10 volume Since there is no drive or OS installed yet, you will be asked to choose a virtual optical disk, click on the Folder icon and choose the Windows 10 ISO you downloaded earlier, then click \u201cStart\u201d In a moment or two you\u2019ll be in the Windows 10 installer, select your language and click \u201cNext\u201d Go through the standard Windows 10 installation experience, this can take a little while but eventually you\u2019ll create a user account, select a user name, and do some basic Windows configuration When setup is finished, Windows 10 will be running in VirtualBox, right on your Mac \u2013 yes this is a full featured version of Windows\nWhen you\u2019re finished, quit VirtualBox like any other application and Windows 10 will shut down. When you want to run Windows again in Mac OS X, just launch VirtualBox again, select your Windows 10 virtual machine, and click the \u201cStart\u201d button to boot Windows in the app. Easy, right?\nYes, this is a complete version of Windows 10. These preview builds expire eventually when the final version comes out from Microsoft, but there is some speculation that they may make Windows 10 free. Regardless, when the final version comes out you\u2019ll be able to install it and run within VirtualBox the same way as outlined above.\nKeep in mind this is a virtual machine, which basically means the VirtualBox app is functioning as a virtual computer on top of your existing Mac. This undoubtedly impacts performance, which is part of why the more resources the computer has the better the experience, so you\u2019re not going to want to be using this for trying to play some wild Windows games in Mac OS X. Nonetheless, this is more than sufficient for basic Windows tasks, using Windows apps like Internet Explorer, or just to get a feel for Windows 10. For a true native Windows experience on a Mac, you\u2019d want to install Windows with Boot Camp as a side-by-side bootable operating system, we\u2019ll cover that separately here if that interests you.\nIf you\u2019re enjoying this VirtualBox experience, you may be pleased to discover that you can run many other operating systems in the virtual machine environment as well. If you want to try Linux, you can run Ubuntu on your Mac with VirtualBox, or many versions of Internet Explorer in different Windows VMs, Windows 8, even Android 4, older versions of Mac OS X like Snow Leopard, and much more, you can explore our VirtualBox section for more.\nIf you get tired of Windows 10, you can either delete the virtual machine from within VirtualBox, or remove the Windows .vdi file (the virtual disk image) from your hard disk manually. Keep in mind that if you delete the VM, any files that you created in Windows will be removed as well.",

        "title": "The Apple Watch Battery Is Replaceable.",
        "body": "The Apple Watch got its grand unveiling yesterday. You can read our round-up of details from Apple\u2019s event here. But as tech watchers chewed over the price-tag for the latest luxury gizmo to be born in Cupertino talk turned to obsolescence.\nThe Apple Watch starts at $349 for the sports watch and rises to a cool $17,000 for top-of-the-luxury-line 18-karat gold Edition. But who wants to shell out thousands for an add-on electronic device that\u2019s likely going to be obsolete in two years?\nWell, when it comes to the battery at least, owners of Apple Watch will be able to extend its lifespan. An Apple spokesman confirmed to TechCrunch the \u201cbattery is replaceable\u201d. Albeit, it\u2019s not clear how much it will cost to send in your wearable to Apple to get it returned with a new cell in place. Update: We understand the lifecycle of the battery is around three years.\nThe other potential obsolescence issue relates to the processor. It\u2019s not clear whether Apple will offer any kind of CPU and/or RAM upgrade to existing owners. At the time of writing Apple had not responded to our request for clarification. We\u2019ll update this post with any additional details. (Given the varying price-points, it\u2019s possible Apple might offer certain types of internal upgrades to owners of only the more premium Apple Watches \u2014 who\u2019ve shelled out the most in the first place.)\nEven so, battery longevity is arguably more of a pressing issue, given that the power demands for such a lightweight wearable are constrained by usage limitations. The use-cases Apple is sketching are mostly about allowing the owner to reduce their exposure to digital noise via curated notifications and selective communications.\nHow much more processing clout you need to power that is up for debate, especially given that the Watch requires its wearers also own an iPhone pocket computer \u2014 which they likely will continue to upgrade, per carrier cycles.\nThe fitness angle for Apple\u2019s wearable is probably going to be the most power thirsty use-case, based on utilizing more sensor tech, so it\u2019s likely no accident the sports watch version is the cheapest \u2014 and thus the least painful to upgrade entirely. Buyers of the $17,000 watch clearly aren\u2019t going to be interested in sweating all over their luxury tech.\nOne thing is amply clear: the daily battery life of the Watch will be a pain-point. Apple is claiming it will be good for \u201call-day mixed usage\u201d \u2014 albeit that boils down to just \u201c90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of app use, and a 30-minute workout with music playback from Apple Watch via Bluetooth over the course of 18 hours\u201d.\nIf you\u2019re using the Watch for a workout with the heart rate sensor turned on usage drops to up to seven hours. Music playback squeezes its battery life to up to 6.5 hours. And taking phone calls will limit usage to up to three hours.\nIf you\u2019re happy just using your expensive smartwatch as a timepiece the battery can apparently last up to two days \u2014 which still sounds laughably brief to anyone who wears a non-smartwatch. And if you\u2019re used to owning automatic mechanical timepieces stamped with a luxury brand you are absolutely not used to having to charge your high class wrist-wear every other day.",

        "title": "All 650 Members of Parliament in the UK will receive an iPad Air 2 after the May election",
        "body": "Getting elected to British Parliament has an added bonus this year. According to The Telegraph , all 650 Members of Parliament (MP) in Great Britain will be given an iPad Air 2 and a laptop after the May election. The House of Commons Commission says the new hardware will cost around \u00a3200,000 ($300,000) over the next five years. Each MP will be given a 16GB Wi-Fi + Cellular iPad Air 2, which costs \u00a3499 ($744). Apple's tablet was chosen by the commission in part because it's already popular among MPs \u2014 209 members in the House of Commons possess an iPad, including Prime Minister David Cameron.\nDespite that, there are some MPs who aren't happy with the decision. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Chi Onwurah complained that MPs \u2014 like Nigel Mills who was caught playing Candy Crush \u2014 would use the tablet to play games and listen to music, and that \"locking some of the most powerful people in the country into a platform that most of my constituents can't afford seems like a mistake.\" In response, Commission chairman John Thurso said, \"Our requirements are for a secure, SIM-enabled tablet with a good life expectancy and [capability] of supporting future upgrades. The Apple iPad Air 2 meets these requirements and is competitively priced when compared with similar models.\"",

        "title": "BMW i3 may soon have an Apple operating system running the show",
        "body": "BMW could be working with Apple on its next in-car operating system for its i3.\nThis follows numerous rumours that Apple is developing its own Apple car.\nAn interview with BMW in German car magazine Auto Motor Sport suggested the car manufacturer was developing a car with Apple, which was later denied by BMW via Reuters. But BMW did confirm it was having \"regular talks\" with Apple on \"topics like connected vehicles\" \u2013 when asked if that was for an Apple OS a \"no comment\" response was offered despite flat out denying the previous Apple Car question.\nPOCKET-LINT VIDEO OF THE DAY\nBMW has already shown off intelligent car smarts with its i8 fob that reads out data from the car like battery capacity and mileage. Auto Motor Sport suggests the new Apple OS would allow the car to communicate and exchange data like fuel consumption and movement data with an iPhone, the Apple Watch, iPad and Mac.\nTim Cook said, in a recent Telegraph interview, that the Apple Watch could be used to replace a car key fob. Apple has hired plenty of automotive specialists suggesting it is working on something more expansive than CarPlay. Apple also revealed the BMW i Remote App for Apple Watch which works like the phone version showing car data, but not yet being used as a key replacement.\nRumours have pointed towards Apple taking control of the centre console in cars but is often met with skepticism at the thought of manufacturers giving away that much control to a third-party.\nDespite doubt Apple Car rumours haven't stopped. Could this all just be CarPlay development or will we see a Mac operating system running a BMW i3 soon? We hope so and look forward to seeing it arrive as an update for current i3 owners and in newer models as standard.\nREAD: Apple's secret car project: Is it really thinking about making vehicles?",
