        "body": "An Android statue is displayed in front of a building on the Google campus on January 31, 2022 in Mountain View, California. Google parent company Alphabet will report fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday after the closing bell.\nGoogle on Wednesday announced it's adopting new privacy restrictions that will cut tracking across apps on its Android devices, following a similar move made by Apple last year that upended several firms' advertising practices.\nGoogle said it's developing new privacy-focused replacements for its advertising ID, a unique string of characters that identifies the user's device. The digital IDs in smartphones often help ad-tech companies track and share information about consumers.\nThe changes could affect big companies that have relied on tracking users across apps, like Facebook parent Meta. Apple's adjustments hit Meta particularly hard, for example. Meta said earlier this month Apple's privacy changes will decrease the social media company's sales this year by about $10 billion. That news contributed to wiping $232 billion from the company's market cap in a single day, eventually pushing the total below $600 billion. Last June, Meta was worth more than $1 trillion.\nBut while Meta fought against Apple's changes, it voiced support for the way Google plans to implement its privacy tweaks.",

        "title": "Apple's retail employees are reportedly using Android phones and encrypted chats to keep unionization plans secret",
        "body": "Apple may be the world\u2019s largest company with a market cap of almost $3 trillion, but its retail workers seem to hardly benefit from all that success, according to the latest reports. As a result, employees at several Apple Stores across the US are secretly working to unionize based on issues surrounding their take-home pay.\nThe dissent has seen employees of at least two US Apple Stores garner support from national unions on their way to making submissions to the National Labor Relations Board, per sources speaking to The Washington Post. What\u2019s more, another six locations are supposedly at less-advanced stages in the unionization process.\nANDROIDPOLICE VIDEO OF THE DAY\nApple\u2019s hourly rates are consistent with what other retailers pay in the same regions, but the animosity comes from the fact that most of those other companies do not earn nearly as much as the tech giant. Rising inflation and housing prices across the country are impacting unionization decisions, too, and many of the workers feel like their hourly wages are not keeping pace. The pro-union workers spoke to the media outlet in confidence, not yet wanting to let out their identities to avoid possible retaliation from Apple. To avoid eavesdropping by store managers and ensure they remain anonymous, the said employees have also reportedly been using encrypted chats and even Android phones.\nApple has more than 270 locations in the United States alone and employs over 65,000 retail workers. The company is known for its loyal customers and employees alike and has seen astonishing growth in recent years. It generated over $365 billion in revenue for the twelve months leading up to September 30, 2021 \u2014 a 33% increase year-over-year. The company did say that it plans to increase retail employees' pay by between 2% and 10% \"depending on the store location and role,\" according to Bloomberg, and will double the number of sick days offered for both full-time and part-time employees, along with increases to vacation day allotments and paid parental leave up to six weeks.\nThe retail employees' fight for unionization was reportedly inspired by recent wins at several Starbucks stores around the US, which started at a store in Buffalo, New York and has since spread to nearly 100 stores across the country.",

        "body": "watch now\nFacebook parent Meta said on Wednesday that the privacy change Apple made to its iOS operating system last year will decrease the social media company's sales this year by about $10 billion. \"We believe the impact of iOS overall is a headwind on our business in 2022,\" Meta CFO Dave Wehner said on a call with analysts after the company's fourth-quarter earnings report. \"It's on the order of $10 billion, so it's a pretty significant headwind for our business.\" related investing news How big a threat is ChatGPT to Google? Morgan Stanley breaks it down Facebook's admission is the most concrete data point so far on the impact to the advertising industry of Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature, which reduces targeting capabilities by limiting advertisers from accessing an iPhone user identifier.\nFacebook Chief Executive Officer and founder, Mark Zuckerberg, leaving the Merrion Hotel in Dublin after meeting with Irish politicians to discuss regulation of social media, transparrency in political advertising and the safety of young people and vulnerable adults. On Tuesday, April 2, 2019, in Dublin, Ireland. Artur Widak | NurPhoto | Getty Images\nMeta shares sank 23% in extended trading on Wednesday after the company warned about numerous challenges and came up short on user numbers. Facebook said first quarter revenue will be $27 billion to $29 billion, while analysts were expecting that number to exceed $30 billion. Wehner said the $10 billion revenue hit this year is merely a best guess. \"We're just estimating what we think is the overall impact of the cumulative iOS changes to where the 2022 revenue forecast is,\" Wehner said. \"If you aggregate the changes that we're seeing on iOS, that's the order of magnitude. We can't be precise on this. It's an estimate.\"\nApple CEO Tim Cook delivers a keynote during the European Union's privacy conference at the EU Parliament in Brussels, Belgium October 24, 2018. Yves Herman | Reuters\nApple first introduced the ATT feature in iOS 14.5, which was released for iPhones last year. It's also included in iOS 15, which is running on 72% of modern iPhones, according to Apple. ATT consists of popups that ask users whether they want to be tracked when opening up an app. If the user says no, the app developer can no longer access the IDFA, a device ID that's used to target and measure the effectiveness of online ads. A study from ad measurement firm AppsFlyer in October suggested that 62% of iPhone users were choosing to opt-out of sharing their IDFA. The privacy feature disrupts the behind-the-scenes mechanics of many mobile ads, especially those that confirm whether a purchase or download was made. IPhone apps with targeted advertising can instead use SKAdNetwork, an Apple tool built as an alternative, which Apple says is more private. Online advertising companies have voiced their displeasure with the feature since it was first announced in June 2020, but Facebook has been the loudest in its criticism. In December 2020, Facebook ran a marketing campaign including full-page ads in major newspapers blasting the feature and saying that the change was about \"profit, not privacy.\" The next day, Apple CEO Tim Cook used Facebook's app in a tweet as an example of how the feature works. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's operating chief, said on Wednesday that ATT would hurt small businesses that rely on digital advertising to grow and are much more dependent than larger companies on personalized ads. It's a theme Facebook has hit repeatedly in its attacks on Apple. Sandberg said the changes are diminishing the accuracy of Facebook's ads, driving up prices based on an outcome like a sale or download. She also said that measuring whether those conversions occur is becoming more difficult. A day before Facebook's results, Alphabet blew past estimates with its fourth-quarter numbers, and cited strength in e-commerce ads, an area where Facebook saw weakness. Wehner suggested that Apple's changes aren't having the same impact on search as they are on other types of apps. He referenced how much money Google makes for Apple as the default search engine on the Safari browser. \"Given that Apple continues to take billions of dollars a year from Google Search, the incentive clearly is for this policy discrepancy to continue,\" Wehner said.

These users have complained, however, that Zoom appears to be keeping the microphone on constantly, even when they're not in a call.\nAnd if the mic isn't actually live, this defeats the purpose of the indicator.\nUsers on a Zoom community chat thread noted that even after installing the update, the issue persisted, with one commenting: \"Well, that most recent update seems to have made no obvious difference. I've just noticed the orange dot again, and when I quit Zoom, Timing.app told me that I'd apparently been on a 2 hour Zoom call.\n\"At this point, it looks like it's safest to only run Zoom while on active calls and keep it quit otherwise.\"\nTwitter users concurred this morning, with one dev commenting, \"You can see the orange dot on Mac since the last update, that shows mic usage.\"\nZoom is no stranger to privacy fears. At one point it installed a hidden web server on customers' Macs to enable automatic call handling. Notably, Apple updated macOS to remove the hidden program.\nThe Register asked Zoom for comment yesterday afternoon. A company rep told us they \"were looking into this.\" We'll update if a statement arrives.\nIn the meantime, if you'd like to know if apps are snooping on you, there are various third-party products such as Micro Snitch or OverSight to help you to monitor who's monitoring you. \u00ae",

The feature appears to be live in version 20220121_02_RC00 of the app, according to Droid-Life, but not for every user. Although it didn\u2019t work on every phone we tried, we were able to get it working on an Oppo Find X3 Pro, which is more than can be said for when the feature initially started appearing last November.\nThe feature fixes a long-standing issue that can affect SMS chats between iPhone and Android users. When an iPhone user reacts to an Android message with emoji, the Android user typically sees this reaction sent as an entirely separate text message, resulting in confusion and lots of unnecessary clutter.\nHow the reactions appear to the recipient, on Android.

The new beta app now treats emoji reactions the same across both operating systems.\nAs 9to5Google points out, there are inconsistencies between how reactions are represented on each operating system.

Update your settings here to see it.\nCrucially, Meta's Q1 2022 revenue came up short, with the company estimating between $27 billion to $29 billion in the current quarter, below analysts' expectations of $30.25 billion.\nShares of Meta plummeted 22% following the report.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. REUTERS/Andreas Gebert\nThe quarter marks the first time Meta has reported its earnings as a company focused on building out the metaverse, not just social media apps like Facebook and Instagram. But Meta has warned it will take time to build out its metaverse capabilities to the level where users can interact with each other across vast virtual worlds via augmented reality and virtual reality headsets.\nQ4 was also the first quarter in which Meta released revenue numbers for its Reality Labs segment, which piled up losses of $3.3 billion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg previously announced that the company spent $10 billion on its metaverse effort in 2021.\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\nMore pressing in the near term is Meta\u2019s ability to continue to navigate Apple\u2019s (AAPL) recent privacy changes that allow iOS users to opt out of letting their apps track them across the web. The feature, called App Tracking Transparency, has been a roadblock for apps like Facebook and Snap (SNAP), which rely on that kind of data to sell ads to advertisers.\nAnd according to Meta CFO David Wehner, the iOS feature will hurt Meta moving forward.\n\"We will lap a period in which Apple's iOS changes were not in effect and we anticipate modestly increasing ad targeting and measurement headwinds from platform and regulatory changes,\" he said.\nWehner also pointed to inflation and supply chain disruptions, as well as exchange rates as the company's other pain points.\nStory continues\nThat\u2019s not Meta\u2019s only problem, though. The company continues to face increasing competition from the likes of TikTok and Snap, and, more importantly, must contend with an ongoing antitrust lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission.\nLast month, District Judge James Boasberg ruled that the FTC\u2019s suit against Meta can continue despite protests from the social networking company. In its suit, the FTC alleges that Meta ran a buy or bury scheme in which it sought to quash competition from smaller up-and-coming rivals.\nThe commission ultimately wants to break Meta up into smaller social networks. Without its combined network of apps, however, Meta would lose its spot as the world\u2019s largest social media company. Whether that comes to pass, however, will take years to determine, as the suit is unlikely to be resolved in short order.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter\nMore from Dan\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit\nGot a tip?

        "title": "TikTok Can Circumvent Apple and Google Privacy Protections and Access Full User Data, 2 Studies Say (Exclusive)",
        "body": "TikTok can circumvent security protections on Apple and Google app stores and uses device tracking that gives TikTok\u2019s Beijing-based parent company ByteDance full access to user data, according to the summaries of two major studies obtained by TheWrap that appear to confirm longstanding concerns raised by privacy experts about the popular video-sharing app.\nThe studies, conducted by \u201cwhite hat\u201d cybersecurity experts that hack for the public good, were completed in November 2020 and January 2021. TheWrap verified the studies and confirmed their conclusions with five independent experts.\nWhen asked by TheWrap, reps for TikTok \u2014 whose parent company ByteDance has had ties to the Chinese government \u2014 declined to confirm or deny the validity of the research.\nThe summaries of the studies, shared exclusively with TheWrap, suggest that TikTok is able to avoid code audits on the Apple and Google app stores. More alarmingly, the research found that TikTok is capable of changing the app\u2019s behavior as it pleases without users\u2019 knowledge and utilizes device tracking that essentially gives the company and third parties an all-access pass to user data. This is highly unusual and exceeds the abilities of U.S.-based apps such as Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms.\n\u201cThese dynamic properties allow TikTok carte blanche access to your device within the scope of what the application can see,\u201d said Frank Lockerman, cyber threat engineer at cybersecurity firm Conquest Cyber who reviewed the two \u201cwhite hat\u201d studies. \u201cThe TikTok browser not only has access to convert from web to device, but it also has the ability to query things on the device itself.\u201d\nThird parties and advertisers can end up tracking TikTok users over time across devices and installs, according the summary of a white-hat cybersecurity group\u2019s January 2021 study obtained by TheWrap.\nWhile TikTok contends that its methods are standard, especially for social media apps relying on ads, both the researchers and independent experts say that the app\u2019s code makes it much harder to monitor. \u201cConsequentially, just because the application doesn\u2019t do anything bad today, doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t do bad things in the future,\u201d one study said.\nStory continues\nAfter reviewing the studies\u2019 findings, Russ Jowell, mobile development expert at BestApp.com, said that it is difficult to know the full extent of TikTok\u2019s data mining capabilities and intent. But overall, he said: \u201cIt seems to me that ByteDance has gone to monumental lengths \u2014 possibly more than Facebook, Twitter and other social networks \u2014 to conceal the inner workings of their app.\u201d\nA spokesperson for TikTok declined to address the studies directly, but told TheWrap that the company adheres to app store policies, adding that its product meets information security standards in the U.S., the U.K., Ireland, India and Singapore and recently received certification by the ioXt Alliance for meeting standards and commitments to cybersecurity and transparency. In fact, TikTok said it works with the ethical hacker community and researchers through a program called HackerOne to test its product.\n\u201cThe security and privacy of our global community is always a top priority,\u201d the company said in a statement provided to TheWrap. \u201cStaying ahead of next-generation cyberthreats requires continuously strengthening the security of our platform, which is why we continually work to validate our security standards and collaborate with industry-leading experts to test our defenses.\u201d\nNonetheless, some countries have made their own decisions regarding TikTok. The app itself is not available in China, and India banned it in 2020 over national security concerns.\nAfter former president Donald Trump attempted to ban the Chinese-owned app as part of his executive order in 2020, the Biden administration last June dropped the outright ban but is now considering new regulations that would affect foreign-owned services, namely TikTok. The proposed rules from the Department of Commerce would add criteria for Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to consider when reviewing software that pose an \u201cundue or unacceptable risk.\u201d\nIn a short time, TikTok\u2019s popularity seems unstoppable, more than doubling U.S. users between 2019 and 2021, to 78.7 million. The social video app is gaining at speeds that threaten the growth of 18-year-old Facebook and its younger platform Instagram \u2014 both of which are losing the fight over younger users. Last September, TikTok hit a milestone of 1 billion monthly users and is on track to gain more Gen Z users than Instagram and more total users than Snap by 2023, according to eMarketer estimates.\nDespite growing interest in regulating the company, TikTok remains a major platform for creators and companies to penetrate the millennial and Gen Z markets. Plus, the app is starting to attract more older users even as it explores making the leap to TV screens. In March 2021, the platform\u2019s reach among users aged 35 to 44 doubled to around 18% when compared to the previous year, according to Comscore. Those aged 45 to 54 accounted for 14.6% of total unique visitors during that period, and those 65 and over accounted for 3.5%, tripled from 2020.\nRepresentatives for Apple and Google didn\u2019t respond to TheWrap\u2019s requests for comment.\n(Insider Intelligence)\nUnder the hood\nIn examining TikTok\u2019s source code in 2020 and 2021, the two studies examined how the app collects data on contacts, device ID and clipboard actions and conceals data being sent to and from TikTok\u2019s servers. TheWrap was not able to obtain the full text of the two studies, but spoke to five independent experts who reviewed the results.\nThe studies show TikTok uses device IDs \u2014 numbers and letters identifying individual devices \u2014 for ad integration, which means advertisers can end up tracking people over time across devices and installs. \u201cOnce one advertiser has a device ID that\u2019s correlated, all privacy is gone,\u201d one report noted.\nReferring TheWrap to its FAQ page, a TikTok rep said: \u201cThe TikTok app is not unique in the amount of information it collects, compared to other mobile apps. In line with industry standards, we collect information that users choose to provide to us in order to improve the experience people have on our app. Also like our peers, we constantly update our app to keep up with evolving security challenges.\u201d\nExamining the backend, researchers also found that the app essentially acts like a web browser. It uses a JavaScript bridge, the programming language for the web, to directly pull the app from TikTok\u2019s servers when it\u2019s launched. This makes the security of the app hard to assess, because that can keep changing, according to Lockerman at Conquest Cyber. Theoretically, it also means TikTok can change its app behavior dynamically or test certain things on the fly without pushing an update to users.\n\u201cThis has great significance to the security of the app, because the state of it cannot be determined by static analysis of the app alone,\u201d Lockerman said.\nOne white-hat security group\u2019s Android analysis of TikTok app from January 2021 shows how the code uses many native libraries thwarts Google code analysis.\nBecause the code uses many native libraries, it can \u201cthwart Google Store code analysis using these libraries,\u201d Lockerman explained. This makes the app harder to reverse engineer, as the code doesn\u2019t rely on system libraries already made available to developers. In coding, libraries are sets of code used for specific tasks. And by effectively running as a web app, the app is capable of circumventing Apple and Google code audits, the research said.\nTikTok maintained that its app is not a web browser that can be rewritten constantly and restated that it follows Google and Apple store policies. The company said the app does operate by pulling server data, such as the latest configuration settings, but that this is standard practice to ensure its performance.\nApple and Google\u2019s app stores are known to be very strict in implementing measures to protect users from illegal activity, fake apps and other potential dangers. Countless apps have been banned for disguising themselves as tools, such as photo filters or camera scanners, with the intent of scamming users and going after their money and personal information. The Android app store, for example, enforces guidelines on app permissions, user experience and overall accessibility to maintain high-quality apps.\nOn the Apple app, the studies indicated TikTok made its own version of a video player presumably to ensure the code runs properly \u2014 but Lockerman said it\u2019s also likely used to hide things. Additionally, the app relies on a \u201cprefetch system\u201d to load up multiple videos simultaneously in the background while the user is watching. This improves speed, which is in large part what makes TikTok so successful at getting users hooked. By tracking how long users linger on content or which videos they rewatch, TikTok\u2019s algorithm can \u201clearn\u201d people\u2019s interests and drive engagement much faster than its rivals.\nTikTok explained only that it created its own video player to optimize performance for users.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that studies investigating the source code of apps is an analysis based on that point in time. Apps are updated often and corrected through patching.\nSo is TikTok safe to use?\nIn terms of personal safety of TikTok users, the concern is less about vulnerabilities that researchers found on the app than what TikTok is doing with all this information it gathers, Jeff Engle, president of Conquest Cyber, told TheWrap. The potential dangers, as is the case with all apps tracking user activity, is the risk of threats from external actors and the compromising of user data.\n\u201cAs with any social media, if you are not paying, then you are likely the product,\u201d Engle said. \u201cThe data you give, which almost always is more than users realize, can be hijacked, but that is an individual risk analysis on a user-by-user basis. The collection, control of distribution and manipulation of any social media makes it a powerful weapon.\u201d\nHowever, experts note that TikTok\u2019s data mining may be no worse than that of major social networks like Facebook \u2014 the difference is in what TikTok then does with the data. A study in January by mobile marketing company URL Genius comparing 10 social apps suggested TikTok was the top app collecting user data, such as IP address, location and search history, to share with third parties that can continue tracking across other sites even after you close the app.\nTikTok is actually the international version of social app Douyin, which was released in China in 2016. A year later, parent company ByteDance launched TikTok outside China after merging it with another of its apps, Musical.ly. In fact, TikTok\u2019s former employees have raised concerns over the control of its parent company and its ability to access American user data.\nWhile Facebook users voluntarily fill out personal information on their pages, from their education to where they live, TikTok\u2019s data collection is less obvious to the everyday user \u2014 the app records how long you stay on a video, who you engage with and what topics and content you rewatch the most.\nAcknowledging TikTok\u2019s rising influence, Jowell said it\u2019s unlikely these privacy concerns will cause people to delete the app altogether. But from a security standpoint, his advice is to avoid posting content that contains any personally-identifiable information and to change the settings and outfits you use in your posts. \u201cAlways remember, hitting that send or upload button is akin to your kids leaving the house when they are grown,\u201d Jowell said. \u201cOnce you do it, you no longer have full control of that piece of content.\u201d",

        "body": "Apple\u2019s upcoming iOS 15.4 software update appears to have quietly added a massive quality of life change for its Shortcuts app: the ability to disable the incredibly annoying notifications for personal automations that users have set up on their devices, as spotted by Fjorden developer Florian B\u00fcrger on Twitter.\nFor those who don\u2019t use Shortcuts regularly, the automations feature is one of the most useful and powerful tools that Apple gives its users access to. At its heart, it lets users set up basic \u201cif / then\u201d triggers for a variety of conditions on an iPhone, be it a specific time of day, arriving at a location, getting an email or text from a specific contact, joining a Wi-Fi network, tapping an NFC tag, opening an app, or when your phone hits a certain level of battery life.\nUsed properly, Shortcuts is incredibly useful, allowing things like disabling notifications when your Kindle app is open so you can read in peace, automatically turning on low power mode when your phone\u2019s battery dips below 50 percent, or disabling rotation lock when you open the Apple TV app so your shows enter full-screen mode properly.\nBut up until iOS 15.4, Apple had previously rendered the feature virtually unusable for common tasks by instituting mandatory notifications every single time the conditions were triggered. The new update fixes that, though, by adding a toggle that allows users to disable those notifications makes Apple\u2019s Shortcut automations vastly more usable for day-to-day tasks by allowing you to remove the spammy notifications that used to appear every time you triggered one.\nTo disable the notifications, simply tap on the automation and switch off the new \u201cnotify when run\u201d toggle that\u2019ll appear if you\u2019re running the latest iOS 15.4 beta. You\u2019ll have to do it for each notification, but once you\u2019ve set it up right, you\u2019ll never be bothered by the Shortcuts notification bar for your automations again.\nThe new \u201cnotify when run\u201d toggle to disable automation notifications in Shortcuts\nThere are a few caveats here, though: the new setting is only for Shortcuts automations, not all Shortcuts. That means that if you\u2019re using Shortcuts as a workaround for custom iOS icons, there\u2019s still no way to remove the pop-up banner when you open an app with that method, for example.",

Every other aspect of the device, including the camera specifications and color options, were the same as the previous, sixth-generation iPod touch. In terms of major updates, the iPod touch was last redesigned almost 10 years ago in 2012 at the same time as the \u200ciPhone\u200c 5. Since then, it has had two minor refreshes in 2015 and 2019.\nLooking at the Apple devices that the company sold for the longest time, the seventh-generation iPod touch is still some way off the 2013 \"trashcan\" Mac Pro, which went 2,182 days without an update before the launch of the modular 2019 \u200cMac Pro\u200c.\nThe iPod touch is the only iPod product that Apple still sells following the discontinuation of the iPod nano and iPod shuffle in July 2017. Despite the hopes of some iPod enthusiasts and excitement around the potential nostalgia of reviving the classic iPod design with the click wheel, there have been no rumors of an eighth-generation iPod touch, or of any new iPod models at all, meaning that the future of the entire iPod brand and product line stands in question.",

        "title": "World Trade Center among first to replace office keys with iPhone and Apple Watch",
        "body": "With the release of iOS 15 last year, Apple expanded the Apple Wallet application to support storing office keys for the first time \u2013 this feature allows Apple Watch and iPhone users to access buildings by tapping their device to unlock a door. Now, real estate development firm Silverstein Properties has announced that it is rolling out support for this feature to tenants at the World Trade Center.\nOffice keys in Apple Wallet\nHere\u2019s how Apple describes this feature in iOS 15:\nFor supported corporate offices, add your corporate access badge to Wallet and then use your iPhone and Apple Watch to access locations where your corporate badge is accepted. Tap to unlock your office doors and use your corporate badge in Wallet.\nIn a press release today, Silverstein Properties announced that its implementation of employee badges in Apple Wallet will allow users to access office buildings, tenant floors, fitness centers, and amenity spaces with just a tap of their iPhone or Apple Watch.\nThe setup process is handled through Silverstein\u2019s Inspire application for iPhone. Using this app, employees and tenants can add their employee badge to Apple Wallet on their iPhone and Apple Watch.\n\u201cWe are proud to make it easy for our employees and customers to get into our buildings, their offices, and our shared lounges, cafes, conference facilities and yoga studios using employee badge in Apple Wallet on iPhone and Apple Watch,\u201d said Tal Kerret, President of Silverstein Properties. \u201cThrough our Inspire app, we can now provide and manage access to any number of buildings and spaces in a safe and secure way.\u201d\nOne interesting tidbit here is that this implementation of Apple Wallet integration allows Silverstein to easily manage shared office spaces. The company explains that one company could lease an office suite at 7 World Trade Center on Monday and Tuesday, and another company could lease the same space on Wednesday through Friday. Contactless access to that office can then be managed directly through the Wallet app and Silverstein app on iOS.\nThis capability will launch first at the 7 World Trade Center in New York City, but Silverstein Properties says that it also will expand the service to office customers in New York, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles over the coming months.\n9to5Mac\u2019s Take\nApple has a lot of ambitions for the Apple Wallet application, and much of that ambition unfortunately relies on adoption by third-parties. We\u2019ve already seen this impact the rollout of digital IDs in Wallet, and this marks one of the first instances of support for office keys officially rolling out.\nAdditionally, back in December, Apple launched support for hotel keys in Apple Wallet, but only at six Hyatt hotels. Ideally, all of these features will expand to additional locations sooner rather than later. In the meantime, the initial launches do at least show us how the features work in the real world.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
