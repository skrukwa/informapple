        "title": "An iPhone 12 with USB-C would really help with the environment, not a missing charger",
        "body": "During last week\u2019s Apple\u2019s iPhone 12 event, the Cupertino-based company was proud to tout its environmental initiatives. Its offices, data centers and stores currently run on 100% renewable energy and the company is aiming for net zero \u201cclimate impact\u201d by 2030.\nApple\u2019s environmentally conscious redesign has extended beyond corporate offices and malls. This year\u2019s iPhones will not ship with earbuds or a charger, all in the name of lowering needless waste. This allows 70% more iPhones to be shipped on pallets and, according to Lisa Jackson, VP of environment, policy and social initiatives at Apple, \u201cit\u2019s like removing 450,000 cars from the road per year.\u201d\n\u201cThis could not only help to reduce waste but also would prevent upstream environmental impacts linked to the extraction of primary raw materials, manufacturing and distribution of products,\u201d said Dr. Teresa Domenech, a lecturer in industrial ecology at the University College London\u2019s Institute for Sustainable Resources, to CNBC.\nEven then, there\u2019s a dissonance in Apple\u2019s newly public ecological approach. For all the good the company is purporting to do, there\u2019s one dogged design quirk that continues to remain, flying in the face of its corporate activism. Apple is still sticking with its proprietary Lightning charge port. If the company really did care about the environment, it would have switched to USB Type-C.\nThe iPhone 12\u2019s hidden costs\n(Image credit: Apple)\nAccording to Apple, there are currently 2 billion iPhone charging adapters out in the world, and that\u2019s not including third-party ones. Many of these adapters use the standard rectangular USB Type-A port. But included with the iPhone 12 will be a USB Type-C to Lightning cable, making old adapters incompatible.\nAcross Apple stores later this month, sales reps will likely ask shoppers if they have a charge adapter that\u2019s USB Type-C compatible. Some might, many won\u2019t. Of course, these users could use their old 5W adapters and Type-A to lightning cables as well. But the new iPhone has fast charging, and for $19, users can upgrade to the latest charge adapters for speedy electrical fuel up. This curtails some of those environmental benefits.\nAt this moment, most of the tech world has moved on to USB Type-C. All Android phones are currently on the standard and have been so for years. Even the latest iPads and Macbooks currently use Type-C, so it\u2019s not as if the connection standard is foreign to Apple. It leaves the iPhone as the rogue outlier, stubbornly sticking to outdated electrical pins as a means to keep iPhone users tied to a proprietary port.\nIf Apple had switched to Type-C, it could have allowed the existing ecosystem of cables and adapters to be folded into the iPhone 12. Users with the new iPad or MacBook could roll over their existing charging accessories to keep iPhone 12s charged. Android users jumping to iPhone could have continued to use the charging adapters included with their old phones. Or anyone who knows someone with an Android device could have piggybacked off their existing power setup.\nGiven the potential waste-saving advantages, Apple\u2019s decision to stick to Lightning is all the more baffling. And let\u2019s not forget that Apple will still need to ship tiny Type-C power adapters across the world to accommodate the new cable included with the iPhone 12. While these new adapters will have a long shelf life, it will cut back on the emissions savings that Apple so proudly publicizes.\nWhy Apple won\u2019t kill the Lightning port\n(Image credit: Apple)\nSo, why has Apple chosen not to adopt Type-C for iPhone when the waste-saving advantages are seemingly obvious?\nIt likely comes down to profit. It\u2019s hard to say exactly why Lightning remains, especially when Apple has already switched over to USB-C on iPad and Macbook, but one can surmise that with iPhone being Apple\u2019s most popular product category, downstream accessory sales tied to lightning are powerful.\nCables and charging adapters are cheap to make. While Apple hasn\u2019t revealed manufacturing costs, generally charger production at high scale is only a couple of cents. So, even assuming the production, boxing, and shipping of adapters and cables comes out to a dollar, with a price tag of $19 a piece, it\u2019s easy money.\nAt the moment, Apple reports sales of cables and chargers along with other accessories like Airpods and the Apple Watch. This segment of Apple\u2019s business accounts for $10 billion in quarterly revenue. It\u2019s outperforming the Mac line by almost $3 billion. The financial incentive to switch to USB Type-C for iPhone 12 could rob Apple of the overwhelming gains from accessory sales.\nOutlook\nOverall, Apple\u2019s move to not include a charge adapter with this year\u2019s phone is good for the environment. Apple is often a trend setter, with the rest of the tech world following suit. Don\u2019t be surprised if Samsung, LG, and others start removing accessories and making boxes slimmer (though probably not right away in Samsung\u2019s case ). And of course, not having to include accessories will also increase profit margins.\nBut don\u2019t assume that Apple is being altruistic about any of this. If it were, it would have killed Lightning years ago, instead of clinging to it with a death grip to keep iPhone users from buying elsewhere.",

        "title": "Apple should switch the iPhone to USB-C if it really wants to help the environment",
        "body": "If you buy an iPhone in the future, you\u2019re not getting an included charging brick or earbuds. Apple says the reasons are environmental. Giving out fewer \u201cfree\u201d accessories with every phone means using less materials, the company claims, and also makes for smaller boxes that can be shipped more efficiently. So going forward, those boxes will just come with a phone and a Lightning to USB-C cable.\nI think Apple\u2019s approach is generally a good thing, but it should have gone further by switching away from its proprietary Lightning port entirely and fully embracing USB-C. Right away, that Lightning to USB-C cable would turn into a much more useful USB-C to USB-C cable that could charge basically all of your electronics. Or better still, Apple could remove the cable entirely and just ship the phone by itself, eliminating even more duplicitous waste.\nIt\u2019s a relatively small change for each person buying an iPhone, but it\u2019s massive when you consider the fact that Apple shipped almost 200 million iPhones over the past year, according to IDC. Chargers might make up a relatively small proportion of total e-waste, as Wired notes, but on a global basis, that\u2019s still tens of thousands of metric tons annually. And as the lack of headphone jacks on 2020\u2019s flagship smartphones shows, Apple\u2019s decisions also have a huge influence on the rest of the industry.\nApple argues no charging brick makes for smaller, more efficient, packaging. Image: Apple\nUSB-C is already becoming the standard\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that USB-C isn\u2019t a perfect standard. Its naming scheme has been a mess (the current USB standard is called USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 for chrissake), and there are so many bad USB-C cables in the wild that some people have made it their mission to root out the worst of them. To borrow a famous turn of phrase, USB-C is the worst connection standard... except for all the others. But it\u2019s also the best one yet created.\nUSB-C is the worst connection standard, apart from all the others\nIn 2020, USB-C is about as universal as wired connection standards come. It\u2019s used by over-ear headphones, true wireless earbuds, VR headsets, tablets (including some of Apple\u2019s), laptops (including all of Apple\u2019s) and laptop accessories. It\u2019s used by game consoles like the Nintendo Switch, and it\u2019ll be used with both the PS5 and the Xbox Series X\u2019s controllers when those consoles ship next month. USB-C batteries are becoming commonplace and chargers are getting tiny and extremely capable \u2014 with up to 100 watts, a powerful battery or a charger the size of a deck of playing cards can sometimes power a laptop, tablet, and phone all at once.\nNot only is USB-C used almost everywhere, it\u2019s also hard to name something that Lightning actually does better. Longtime Apple blogger John Gruber has argued in the past that it\u2019s a more elegant and slightly thinner port which\u2026 sure, maybe? But is that enough reason to maintain the status quo if Apple cares as much about the environment as it claims?\nYou probably already have a USB-C charger\nApple\u2019s core argument for taking the charger out of the box is that it avoids piling on accessories that a lot of people already own. During its presentation, Apple estimated that there are 2 billion of its power adapters out in the world, and \u201cbillions\u201d of third-party chargers.\nBut let\u2019s put that into perspective. According to IDC, Apple commanded just 13.9 percent of the global smartphone market in 2019, shipping close to 200 million phones last year. Meanwhile, the rest of the industry combined shipped over a billion phones over the course of just a single year, and most of those devices used USB-C. That\u2019s a lot of people who already have everything they need to charge a hypothetical USB-C iPhone, including both charging bricks and USB-C cables. And it doesn\u2019t include all the people who bought other USB-C devices like headphones, laptops, and tablets, including recent MacBook and iPad Pro devices.\nThe Fairphone 3 Plus ships with no charging brick or cable at all\nAll of that means that if you really want to, you can absolutely sell a USB-C smartphone without any charging accessories at all. That\u2019s what ethical smartphone manufacturer Fairphone does. Inside the box for its most recent phone, the Fairphone 3 Plus, you\u2019ll find no headphones, no USB-C charging cable, and no USB-C charging brick. Instead there\u2019s a small screwdriver, so that when the time comes, you\u2019ll be theoretically able to repair the phone for yourself rather than having to throw it out.\nA slightly weird halfway house\nThere are serious questions to be asked about how positive an environmental impact Apple\u2019s existing plan is actually going to have. A big part of Apple\u2019s pitch is that there are already billions of power adapters out there, but it\u2019s likely that a significant portion of them use the USB-A standard, which is incompatible with the Lightning to USB-C cable Apple now packs into the box for faster charging speeds. Apple only started putting USB-C power adapters in the box last year, and even then it was limited to the Pro models, meaning the vast majority of iPhones sold came with a USB-A brick bundled in.\nUSB-C charging bricks only started getting bundled with last year\u2019s iPhone 11 Pro. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\nI\u2019m not saying there\u2019ll be no environmental impact. With the iPhone 12, a lot of people will still be able to reuse their existing USB-A to Lightning charging cables and USB-A power bricks, regardless of the new cable they get in the box. But then what\u2019s the point of that Lightning to USB-C cable, particularly if you wind up switching to Apple\u2019s MagSafe wireless chargers instead? If it were a USB-C to USB-C cable, at least you could use it with other gadgets. Apple could have a much bigger environmental impact in the long run by eliminating its proprietary Lightning port entirely.\nApple\u2019s argument\nWe already know what Apple thinks about potentially switching to USB-C connectors, because it put out a statement on this very topic earlier this year. The statement came in response to EU efforts to mandate a common charger for all smartphones, and Apple argued that a switch to USB-C would actually be worse for the environment overall, by rendering hundreds of millions of Lightning accessories obsolete. Here\u2019s the relevant part of the statement it issued in January (emphasis added):\n\u201cMore than 1 billion Apple devices have shipped using a Lightning connector in addition to an entire ecosystem of accessory and device manufacturers who use Lightning to serve our collective customers. Legislation would have a direct negative impact by disrupting the hundreds of millions of active devices and accessories used by our European customers and even more Apple customers worldwide, creating an unprecedented volume of electronic waste and greatly inconveniencing users.\u201d\nThere absolutely are a lot of Lightning accessories out there. But the argument rings hollow given Apple\u2019s own history of obviating all those 30-pin iPod docks and early iPhone peripherals when it switched to Lightning in 2012. Instead of sending them straight to the dump, Apple and others sold 30-pin to Lightning adapters to extend the usefulness of those legacy accessories for years. Apple and its partners can surely now do the same in order to preserve all those Lightning devices. Yes, it would create a one-time glut of adapters that would eventually end up in landfills, but it\u2019s the short-term price to pay for the long-term benefits of convergence.\nSame pain, more gain\nAs someone who has a whole drawer filled with spare power adapters I never use, I\u2019m sympathetic to what Apple is trying to achieve with the iPhone 12. Giving out duplicate accessories with every new phone really isn\u2019t sustainable if we want to try and cut down on the estimated 53.6 million metric tons of electronic waste we threw out last year.\nThe iPhone 11 should have been the last with Lightning\nBut I also have some sympathy for those who say Apple is nickel-and-diming its customers with the move. When a phone costs hundreds of dollars, it\u2019s hard not to feel a little cheated by a smaller box with fewer accessories, particularly if the remaining ones are still half-proprietary.\nBy using the environment to justify the removal of wasteful iPhone charging accessories, Apple has now argued itself into a corner. If its environmental concerns are important enough to influence what gets included with a new phone, then they should also be important enough to influence its design directly.",

        "body": "By Ankita Chakravarti: Apple launched four new iPhones including the iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Out of all the four new releases, only two will be available in India for now- the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro. Soon after the new iPhones were announced, Apple discontinued the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone Pro Max. The company also reduced the prices of its existing iPhones including the iPhone 11, iPhone XR, and iPhone SE.\nadvertisement\nThe Apple iPhone 12 is priced starts at Rs 69,900 for the base variant whereas the iPhone 12 Pro costs Rs 1,19,900 for the base variant. Well, that is not something unexpected. Considering the previous trends, the iPhone Pro models are released with an exorbitant price tag. Now to add to the woes of people looking to buy the iPhone 12 Pro, they should know that the Apple iPhone 12 Pro is more expensive in India than in any other country. Dubai for instance sells the iPhone 12 Pro for Rs 84,000.\nNow this rings a bell. The iPhone 12 Pro is comparatively cheaper in Dubai. So cheap that you can actually go to Dubai, buy the phone and come back. Let us explain the math to you for a better understanding.\niPhone 12 Pro Price in India for 128 GB: Rs 1,19,000\niPhone 12 Pro Price in Dubai for 128GB: Rs 84,000. It costs Dh 4,199 in Dubai and if you convert the currency to INR, the price comes down to almost Rs 84,000.\nSo, should this mean that you can go to Dubai, buy the phone and then come back? Well, if you ask me. It is not that bad an idea. The 12 Pro will go on sale from November 6. So you book a flight for Dubai from Delhi or Kolkata for November 6 or later than that, you can get the return ticket for a little over Rs 18,000.\nBelow is the exact amount, you would be spending on your flight tickets to Dubai from New Delhi. However, the amount might change depending on the availability but this is what we found when tried booking a ticket to Dubai.\nFlight ticket: Indigo Rs 17929 approx\niPhone 12 Pro 128GB: 84,000\nSome other expenses: Around Rs 10,000\nTotal: Around Rs 1,11,929\nMoney saved: Around Rs 8000\nNow, considering that the world is battling coronavirus pandemic and the virus is in no mood to slow down, we do not encourage anyone to travel. The whole idea was to not send you to Dubai but to draw your attention towards Apple\u2019s exorbitant pricing in India. It is no secret that the taxes and duties that are applied to imported phones are highest in India. The taxes are so high that for an important iPhone that you will end up paying an average tax of Rs 24,000 for something like an iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Mini.\nadvertisement\nHowever, despite the sky-rocketing prices, iPhone still sells best in India and the buyers give whatever price Apple asks them to pay. So for a business, that is not a bad deal at all.\nALSO READ | Apple iPhone 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max launched: Price, specifications, and features\n--- ENDS ---",

        "title": "Google Reportedly Pays Apple $8-12 Billion Per Year to be Default iOS Search Engine",
        "body": "The United States Justice Department is targeting a lucrative deal between Apple and Google as part of one of the U.S. government's largest antitrust cases, reports The New York Times.\nOn Tuesday, the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, claiming the Mountain View-based company used anticompetitive and exclusionary practices in the search and advertising markets to maintain an unlawful monopoly.\nIn 2017, Apple updated an agreement to keep Google's search engine as the preselected option on Apple devices. The New York Times reports that Apple receives an estimated eight to 12 billion dollars per year in exchange for making Google the default search engine on its devices and services, including the iPhone and Siri. This is believed to be the single biggest payment Google makes to anyone, and it accounts for 14 to 21 percent of Apple's annual profits.\nProsecutors claim that the deal is representative of illegal tactics used to protect Google's monopoly and stifle competition. According to the Justice Department, almost one half of Google's search traffic now comes from Apple devices, and the prospect of losing the agreement has been described as \"terrifying\" and a \"code red\" scenario within the company. Google's search traffic is integral to its business model due to its system of ads.\nApple is likewise coming under fire for facilitating anticompetitive behavior by acquiescing to the deal and extracting more money with regular renegotiations. Although the two companies are competitors in Silicon Valley, the agreement is said to be part of \"an unlikely union of rivals.\"\nThe Justice Department's complaint cites a senior Apple employee's remark from 2018 which said that \"our vision is that we work as if we are one company.\"\nThe legal intervention poses a threat to a significant chunk of Apple's revenue, but it is a bigger danger for Google, which would seemingly have no way to replace the traffic it would lose. The New York Times speculates that such a breakup could push Apple to acquire or build its own search engine, which could in turn pose an even greater threat to Google.",

        "body": "After the first reviews for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro emerged yesterday, a new report by Tom's Guide reveals the extent of battery life reductions when using 5G.\nThe report outlines a test wherein the iPhone surfs the web continuously at 150 nits of screen brightness, launching a new site every 30 seconds until the battery drains. Interestingly, the test was run on an iPhone 12 and 12 Pro both over 4G and 5G.\nUsing 5G, the \u200ciPhone 12\u200c lasted just eight hours and 25 minutes, while the \u200ciPhone 12\u200c Pro lasted nine hours and six minutes. When using 4G, the \u200ciPhone 12\u200c and 12 Pro perform better enduring for ten hours and 23 minutes and 11 hours and 24 minutes, respectively. This means that the \u200ciPhone 12\u200c and \u200ciPhone 12\u200c Pro's battery life drains around 20 percent faster when using 5G in this artificial benchmark.\nThe same test on the \u200ciPhone\u200c 11 in 2019 yielded a result of 11 hours and 16 minutes over 4G, and the \u200ciPhone\u200c 11 Pro achieved ten hours and 24 minutes.\nTom's Guide reports that this falls short of the battery life of 5G Android phones under the same test:\nCompared to the Android competition, Apple's new phones are a step behind those devices on our best phone battery life list, especially over 5G networks.\nThe battery capacities across the \u200ciPhone 12\u200c lineup are believed to have been reduced this year, and while it was known that 5G would likely drain battery life, the extent of which was unknown.\nThe battery results may have been behind Apple's move to include a \"Smart Data mode\" with the \u200ciPhone 12\u200c and \u200ciPhone 12\u200c Pro, which selectively turns off 5G at times when it may not be needed. For example, when streaming music with the screen turned off, Smart Data mode reportedly turns off 5G and favors 4G instead.\nHowever, users can go further and manually turn off 5G to boost battery life on the \u200ciPhone 12\u200c and \u200ciPhone 12\u200c Pro.

Not that long after that October 13 announcement, Samsung seems to be doing the same thing.\nRumors and Korean media reports seen by SamMobile allege that Samsung is strongly considering ditching both the charger and earphones from its smartphone offerings, starting with the \"Galaxy S21\" but also being applied to other models. Samsung may not necessarily go as far as Apple though, as some insiders believe only the headphones would be removed, while the charger will remain for now.\nSuch a move would be beneficial for Samsung in similar ways to Apple. By not including a charger or headphones in the box, it would produce less e-waste which would help the environment, as well as cutting the cost of the product overall.\nFor this latter point, the removal of the items could help reduce the overall cost of the smartphone to users, or to bolster profits by keeping the price the same while cutting production costs. Customers could also be encouraged to buy headphones separately, such as Samsung's Galaxy Buds, further increasing revenue.\nIf true, the reports may be embarrassing to Samsung. Following Apple's October 13 event announcing the iPhone 12, Samsung posted to one of its Facebook accounts a simple image of a charger, along with the words \"Included with your Galaxy,\" to poke fun at what it offers that Apple isn't including in the box.\nA Samsung Facebook post from October 13\nSuch mockery isn't new to Samsung. It has a history of not only creating sarcastic marketing campaigns attacking Apple, but it's also followed Apple's footsteps even after such actions.\nFor example, in August 2019, Samsung was found to have removed advertising from late 2017 where it focused on the lack of wireless charging and a 3.5mm audio port.

Apple (AAPL) blamed Epic for deliberately breaching the terms of its developer contract when Epic sought to circumvent Apple (AAPL)\u2019s in-app payment system \u2014 using a software update that encouraged Fortnite players to buy in-game currency directly from Epic Games.\nThe move meant Apple could not take its 30% cut of Fortnite revenues on iOS, prompting it to ban Fortnite as well as Unreal Engine, a software tool owned by Epic that is widely used by game developers and Hollywood.\nIn federal court, Epic had asked Judge Yvonne Gonzalez for a preliminary injunction that would restore Fortnite to the Apple App Store. It also asked for a ruling barring Apple from retaliating against the company and its overseas affiliates.\nWhile Gonzalez\u2019s Friday decision did not permit Fortnite to return to the App Store, she ruled Apple must not punish Unreal Engine or Epic\u2019s affiliates.\nOther users\u2019 reliance on Epic\u2019s Unreal Engine meant that cutting it off would \u201cunnecessarily impact\u201d them, Gonzalez wrote in her order.\n\u201cEpic Games and Apple are at liberty to litigate this action for the future of the digital frontier, but their dispute should not create havoc to bystanders,\u201d she wrote.\nThe case is viewed as a pivotal fight between two tech titans that could reshape how app stores \u2014 and perhaps the wider digital economy \u2014 function in the future.

        "body": "Last year it appeared that Samsung was putting an end to its marketing approach of mocking Apple over the differences between iPhones and the Galaxy smartphones. Well, that didn\u2019t last long, as Samsung has taken shots at Apple over the decision to stop including a charger with iPhone 12.\nSome of the most notable attack ads from Samsung when it comes to Apple was when Apple removed the headphone jack with the iPhone 7 and the notch that launched with the iPhone X (Samsung also brought up no headphone jack again).\nOf course, it was only a matter of time before Samsung followed Apple\u2019s lead and started ditching the headphone jack in its own Galaxy devices and producing a headphone dongle it previously made fun of. But last year, it quietly removed its ads that used the attack approach.\nWell, Samsung apparently can\u2019t help itself. Although they\u2019re not full video ads, Samsung took to Twitter and Facebook to mock Apple over the iPhone 12 not including a power adapter in the box as well as 120Hz display and 5G (via MacRumors).\nThe big irony here is Samsung is already reported to be in talks to do the same with its upcoming devices. In addition to the charger dig, Samsung claims to have the \u201cbest camera, battery, performance, memory\u201d and also took a swipe at the iPhone not including a 120Hz display.\nHere\u2019s the Facebook post:\nWhile some may be frustrated at Apple for ditching the power adapter, Apple\u2019s perspective is most people have plenty of chargers and there are big environmental savings, the equivalent of removing 450,000 cars from the road each year by making the change (2 million metric tons of carbon). Plus USB-C chargers don\u2019t cost much anyway if you do need one.\nWhen you think about it from that perspective, it\u2019s like Samsung is bragging about polluting more than Apple. With Samsung already allegedly talking about when to copy Apple, how soon do you think it will happen as well as deleting this ad? Share your thoughts in the comments below!\nAnd what do you think? Is Samsung\u2019s approach going back to mocking Apple funny or tired? Clever or just thirsty for attention?\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s revived MagSafe charging standard opens the door for a portless iPhone",
        "body": "Apple revived one of its more beloved technologies, MagSafe, at its annual iPhone reveal on Tuesday, showing off a new line of smartphones with magnets built into the back for fast and sturdy connections to wireless chargers, snap-on cases, and other accessories.\nWhile the old MagSafe was a safety feature for charging laptops without worrying about damaging your machine when the cord was ripped out, the new MagSafe is a savvy, smartphone-centric accessory play for Apple. It lets the company build a new gadget ecosystem for the iPhone that it controls entirely, just like Lightning and Apple\u2019s other proprietary ports and cables, while also offering tangible benefits like faster 15W charging.\nBut while MagSafe now seems like a nice complementary feature to the newly announced iPhones, it paves the way for Apple to make magnetic wireless charging the centerpiece for how we charge all of our devices going forward. Just look at the company\u2019s new MagSafe Duo Charger, a wireless charging stand for both the Apple Watch and iPhone, or Belkin\u2019s even more robust (and also outlandish-looking) MagSafe 3-in-1 charger that lets you charge an Apple Watch, AirPods, and an iPhone all at once. Both seem to nudge us closer to a world in which the iPhone doesn\u2019t need to support Lightning charging or any kind of wired charging whatsoever.\nBelkin\u2019s new MagSafe 3-in-1 charger has charging docks for the AirPods. Apple Watch, and iPhone. Image: Belkin\nAnd Apple is rumored to be working on a portless iPhone for just that reason. Removing the port would mean Apple could avoid \u2014 if it wanted to \u2014 transitioning its smartphone line over to the USB-C standard it now uses on MacBooks and higher-end iPads. It would also allow the company to make devices even thinner, using the same logic it employed when it removed the headphone jack. Waterproofing could become even more effective with fewer holes in your phone, especially if Apple can convince us (and cellular carriers) to embrace an embedded SIM card instead of including a SIM slot in each phone. With MagSafe, Apple could present an alternative way to charge your phone entirely through wireless charging and whatever cables and adapters it may come up with to solve your on-the-go charging needs.\nThere is certainly a financial incentive for Apple to retain control of its charging ecosystem. Apple\u2019s \u201cwearables, home, and accessories\u201d division, which includes major products like the Apple Watch and AirPods in addition to all cables and chargers, was the lowest earner in the company\u2019s most recent financial quarter. But it\u2019s basically neck and neck with the entire iPad business and earns close to $6.5 billion a quarter, making it still vital to Apple\u2019s bottom line as its iPhone revenue growth continues to slow and Apple leans more on its ecosystem and services.\nMagSafe gives Apple a platform to launch to a portless iPhone as soon as next year\nBut Apple is known to at least make an effort to offer a consumer benefit in exchange for eschewing universal standards or making a widely anti-consumer product choice. In this case, a full investment in MagSafe does seem like it would have some very real quality-of-life improvements to owning the iPhone, even if it did involve some serious habit changes for iPhone owners.\nFor one, wireless charging is simply easier and less cumbersome than plugging in a cable, and even more so when magnets are involved so you don\u2019t have to adjust the device\u2019s positioning to ensure the charger activates. MagSafe also presents situations like using your phone in bed without worrying about bending or breaking a cable or damaging the phone\u2019s port.\nPlus, the sheer variety and utility of accessorizing you can now do thanks to built-in magnets on the back of the iPhone is exciting. The snap-on wallet and red leather charging case Apple is making are just a couple of the countless potential accessories we can imagine. Think of magnetic snap-on zoom lenses or bundles of cases that can attach magnetically and don\u2019t need to be forcefully ripped off your phone if you want to swap one for another. PopSocket, the leading maker of removable grips for iPhones, is surely fast at work on MagSafe-ready versions of its products.\nImage: Apple\nFor Apple, MagSafe also presents an opportunity for it to do a little product revisionism after the AirPower fiasco of last year, in which Apple canceled the already-announced product after determining that it couldn\u2019t reliably create the all-in-one wireless charging mat it thought it could. While AirPower is gone for good it seems, MagSafe is now back to help Apple fully realize wireless charging, and MagSafe brings with it the consumer goodwill it accumulated during its time on the MacBook line (even though the earlier iteration of MagSafe is really nothing like this current one).",

        "body": "Article Hero Image\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nNew testing shows Apple's MagSafe charging puck does peak at 15W with iPhone 12, but only when paired with the company's 20W adapter.\nThe apparent restriction was discovered by Aaron Zollo of YouTube channel Zollotech. In a comprehensive evaluation of Apple's MagSafe device posted on Monday, Zollo found two Apple adapters \u2014 a new standalone 20W USB-C device and the 18W unit that came with iPhone 11 Pro handsets \u2014 achieved high rates of charge.\nMeasuring energy throughput with an inline digital meter revealed MagSafe hits the advertised 15W peak charging rate (up to 16W in the video) when paired with Apple's branded 20W adapter. Speeds drop to about 13W with the 18W adapter, and Zollo notes the system takes some time to ramp up to that level.\nOlder adapters and third-party models with high output ratings do not fare well in the test. Apple's own 96W MacBook Pro USB-C adapter eked out 10W with MagSafe, matching a high seen by Anker's PowerPort Atom PD1. Likewise, charging rates hovered between 6W and 9W when attached to Aukey's 65W adapter, Google's Pixel adapter and Samsung's Note 20 Ultra adapter.\nIt appears third-party devices will need to adopt a MagSafe-compatible power delivery (PD) profile to ensure fast, stable energy delivery when connected to iPhone 12 series devices.\nAs can be expected with any charging solution, temperature plays a significant role in potential throughput. Zollo found MagSafe significantly throttles speeds as temperatures rise, meaning actual rates are not a constant 15W even when using the 20W adapter. When heat rises, energy output decreases to protect sensitive hardware components and the battery itself. In some cases, this could prompt users to remove their iPhone from its case \u2014 including Apple-branded MagSafe models \u2014 to achieve maximum thermal efficiency.\nZollo also confirms older Qi-compatible iPhone models, like iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 11 Pro Max, charge at about 5W with MagSafe. Apple previously said Qi devices would charge at 7.5W.",

        "body": "Leaker Max Weinbach has today shared new \"finalized and revised\" information about the upcoming iPhone 12 via his Twitter account @PineLeaks.\nWeinbach states that the \"most important things\" about the new iPhones were already revealed by Chinese Weibo user \"Kang\" via an extensive leak on Friday, but he does offer some specific new information.\nApple is reportedly still intending to ship the \"dynamic zoning algorithm\" feature, which could allow for faster Face ID. The notch may only be reduced in width on the 5.4-inch iPhone 12 mini due to its smaller size. This would be achieved by arranging the components of the TrueDepth camera system more \"tightly,\" but at the cost of increasing its height. Alleged images of the \u200ciPhone 12 mini\u200c's screen emerged in July, which seemed to show a smaller notch.\nhttps://t.co/EPj76hm9wZ\nThe \"dynamic zoning algorithm\" is shipping. The redesigned TrueDepth Camera System though, is not. Instead, a more \"tightly\" arranged TrueDepth will be shipped with the 5.4\" iPhone. The notch shrinks horizontally, but increases slightly vertically. \u2014 Pine (@PineLeaks) October 11, 2020\nWeinbach believes that all \u200ciPhone 12\u200c models will gain significantly improved digital zoom via software enhancements, and the \u200ciPhone 12\u200c Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max will also benefit from improved optical zoom.\nImproved digital zoom will be achieved by combining several frames at different zoom levels and stacking them together - an hybrid of cropping and optical zooming. An algorithm based off of Deep Fusion will take care of correct alignment and sharpening. Smart HDR 3 does the rest. \u2014 Pine (@PineLeaks) October 11, 2020\nThere may also be \"a sort of macro camera\" feature and the ultrawide lens aperture on Pro models may also be able to get closer to subjects, although these are not expected to be headline features. The ultrawide lens is also speculated to have up to a 35% larger aperture to improve low-light performance.\nThe new Ultra Wide is definitely getting a larger aperture, which will result in significantly improved Low Light performance across the board. Again, pay attention to the 12 Pro Max. \u2014 Pine (@PineLeaks) October 11, 2020\nThe \u200ciPhone 12\u200c Pro and 12 Pro Max are claimed to have a boost of at least one hour to battery life, but the \u200ciPhone 12 mini\u200c's battery life is expected to perform worse than the iPhone 11 due to its size.\nhttps://t.co/XjFk5c1zNM\nExpect at least an 1 hour battery life increase for the Pro Models. As seen in internal tests, the 5.4\" iPhone will perform worse than the current iPhone 11, which is expected because of its form factor. \u2014 Pine (@PineLeaks) October 11, 2020\nWeinbach also reinforced previous claims about \u200ciPhone 12\u200c models likely supporting 4K video at 120 or 240 frames per second.\nThe report is apparently based on recent updates from sources that were received over the past three weeks. The \u200ciPhone 12\u200c lineup is almost certain to be revealed on Tuesday at Apple's \"Hi, Speed\" event.",
