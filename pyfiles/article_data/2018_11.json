        "title": "Apple is charging at least 20% more for every product this year.",
        "body": "After Tuesday\u2019s \u201cMore in the Making\u201d event, Apple has officially rolled out its full suite of products for 2018 and beyond. It\u2019s an impressive slate of Macs, iPhones, and iPads, and they will no doubt top many a wish list during the holiday season.\nNow that we know exactly what Apple will be selling for the next 12 months, a disturbing trend has emerged, one that gives new meaning to the word \u201cmore.\u201d\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at last year\u2019s entry-level pricing for new products:\niPhone 8: $699\n$699 iPad Pro 10.5-inch: $649\n$649 iPad Pro 12.9-inch: $799\n$799 Apple Watch Series 3 with GPS: $329\n$329 Apple Watch Series 3 with GPS + Cellular: $399\n$399 Mac mini: $499\n$499 MacBook Air: $999\nThose are all expensive for sure, but not necessarily luxury. And now take a look at this year\u2019s prices:\niPhone XR: $749\n$749 iPad Pro 11-inch: $799\n$799 iPad Pro 12.9-inch: $999\n$999 Apple Watch Series 4 with GPS: $399\n$399 Apple Watch Series 4 with GPS + Cellular: $499\n$499 Mac mini: $799\n$799 MacBook Air: $1,199\nSee what I mean? If you take away older discounted products, Apple has increased the cost of entry to buy an Apple products across the board by no small amount over last year. All said, you\u2019re looking at an average price hike of $150. That\u2019s a significant year-over-year increase, and that\u2019s not to speak of the $5,000 starting price for the iMac Pro.\nRoman Loyola They\u2019re not quite as much as the iMac Pro, but all of the products Apple announced this week cost significantly more than last year.\nIt only goes up from the \u201cbottom.\u201d This year, the customizable options for the iPhone, iPad Pro, Mac mini, and iMac are all much higher than they were last year. You can configure the Mac mini with options that put it at an insane $4,199. Do the same with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and it nearly eclipses $2,000 before you add a Pencil and Keyboard, which also cost more than last year. What gives?\nThe sky\u2019s the limit\nThere seems to be three reasons why Apple would hike prices so astronomically:\nThe price of components has increased by a significant amount. They\u2019re so innovative that research and development costs are astronomical. Growth will start to slow dramatically and Apple wants to compensate with higher prices.\nLet\u2019s examine each of these. When it comes to components, most reports say that prices have decreased for things like RAM and storage over last year. You can even see it at the consumer level, as external SSD drives seem to hit all-time lows on a weekly basis. If anything, Apple would have been justified jacking prices last year, not this year.\nDan Masaoka/IDG The $799 iPhone 8 Plus, right, is cheap compared to the $1,099 iPhone XS Max.\nThe same goes for innovation. Apple got a pass with the iPhone X\u2019s thousand-dollar price tag because it was such a departure from previous iPhones and was loaded with new tech: an OLED screen, True Depth camera, edge-to-edge design. Apple\u2019s new iPads may be different, but there\u2019s nothing that I can see that justifies a 20- to 25 percent price increase. I mean, they still have LCD screens and start at 64GB of storage, so we\u2019re not talking about huge internal changes.\nThat leaves reason three, which is somewhat difficult to figure out. As it stands, most of Apple\u2019s growth in areas that aren\u2019t necessarily hardware related, namely its Services and Other categories. But iPhone, Mac, and iPad sales have all been relatively flat for the last couple of years. Apple picked up the iPhone\u2019s bottom line last year with robust iPhone X sales that raised the average selling price to its highest levels ever, and the same will presumably apply to the iPad and Mac. Even if sales slip somewhat, revenue will increase and make up the difference. And if things stay equal, revenue will rise dramatically.\nBut even so, 20 to 25 percent is a very big hike to expect customers to absorb just to protect Apple\u2019s bottom line. So, I don\u2019t really think that fully explains it either. Rather, I think the explanation is much simpler: Because they can.\nRedefining luxury\nThe explanation is two-fold. On the one hand, Apple is Apple. It\u2019s the richest company in the world because it makes the most desirable products in the world. People have always been willing to spend a premium on a product that sports an Apple logo, and now there are more of them than ever. Tim Cook loves to play up customer satisfaction, and it\u2019s generally in the mid-to-upper 90s for Apple products. In short, people love them.\nJason Cross/IDG The Apple Watch Series 4 is the biggest leap in both design\u2026 and price.\nThe other reason is more psychological. I have no doubt that Apple would explain its price hike with a combination of all three reasons above, but ultimately Apple could make a new $999 MacBook Air or a $650 iPad Pro, or a $499 Mac mini alongside the higher-end models. It just doesn\u2019t want to. After the iPhone X gambit last year, Apple knows the people who are going to buy their products will pretty much pay whatever it asks. Apple isn\u2019t interested in the low-end anymore, at least not with new products. You want a cheap Apple product? You\u2019re going to be paying for last year\u2019s version. And even then, you\u2019re paying a premium for what you\u2019re getting.\nAnd sadly, as long as people keep paying top dollar for new iPad, iPhones, and Macs\u2014and there\u2019s no indication that they won\u2019t\u2014then this is the new normal. Apple has always been known as an \u201caffordable luxury\u201d brand, but we may have to start redefining it as \u201cattainable\u201d luxury. As in if you can afford it.",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Higher Prices Are Pure Greed \u2013 Paris Marx \u2013 Medium",
        "body": "Anyone who\u2019s bought an Apple product in the past few years will be able to tell you that the company\u2019s products, which were already sold at a premium, have gotten even more expensive in recent years. A growing number of Apple customers \u2014 even long-standing ones \u2014 are starting to feel it\u2019s getting to be too much, and they\u2019re absolutely right.\n2018 will likely stand out in the minds of Apple followers as the year its price-hike strategy took effect. In September, Apple announced its iPhones: XR, XS, and XS Max. The iPhone XS remained at the same price as the iPhone X: $999; and the XS Max brought in a new top price of $1,099 just a year after Apple established the $999 category. They keep adding even more expensive iPhones to increase the top price, but they\u2019re also increasing the base price.\nWith no update to the iPhone 8 or 8 Plus, the iPhone XR has become the new base model. In 2014, the iPhone 6 was announced at $649; last year, the base price was bumped to $699 with the iPhone 8; and now the iPhone XR sets the starting price at $749. The entry cost to Apple\u2019s smartphone world just keeps going up \u2014 a trend across the larger product line.\nJust look at the Macs. When Apple revamped the MacBook Pro line in 2016, the base price of the 13\" model jumped by $200 to $1,499, but to get the Touchbar \u2014 a feature that has proven to be basically useless \u2014 customers had to shell out a minimum of $1,799. For the larger 15\" screen, it cost $2,399.\nThe persistently high price of the 12\" MacBook \u2014 it starts at $1,299 \u2014 was a barrier that kept customers buying the MacBook Air. That ultimately justified Apple\u2019s decision to refresh the Air in October, but the company\u2019s leadership failed to learn their lesson: they hiked the Air\u2019s price from $999 to $1,199, added the keyboard everyone\u2019s been complaining about, and took away its USB-A ports for the USB-C ports that have turned the MacBook line into dongle hell. That same day they also increased the base price of the Mac mini from $499 to $799.\nBut don\u2019t worry, Tim Cook didn\u2019t forget about the iPad Pro. Its updated design is really nice \u2014 but you\u2019ll be paying for it. The cheapest iPad Pro is now $799 \u2014 up from $649 \u2014 and its accessories even got a boost: the Apple Pencil is $30 more expensive at $129 and the Smart Keyboard jumped $20 to $179. And with all these price hikes have come increased repair costs and, in some cases, higher AppleCare prices.\nIf this doesn\u2019t scream greed to you, I don\u2019t know what would. Apple knows how tied into its ecosystem its customers are, and it\u2019s taking advantage of that fact by hiking prices across the board. The products have some new features, but not enough to justify all of these price increases. Apple might use the innovation excuse, but its higher prices are more about building in larger profit margins to keep its investors happy.\niPhone sales growth fell off a steep cliff in 2016 and hasn\u2019t recovered. In response, Apple added the $1,000 premium phone tier and began more aggressively raising the base iPhone price. As a result, the average selling price of an iPhone soared above $700 in the first quarter of 2018, stayed there in the second and third quarters, and hit $793 in the fourth quarter.\nApple reported its fourth-quarter results on November 1, and even though iPhone sales growth was flat and sales of iPhone XS and XS Max were below expectations, it still reported smartphone revenue growth of 29 percent thanks to those higher prices. That\u2019s Apple\u2019s new strategy: sales growth may be disappointing, but by steadily increasing prices, they can keep shareholders happy \u2014 and it\u2019s working. In the future, Apple won\u2019t even share unit sales numbers for the iPhone, Mac, or iPad, which could make it more difficult for analysts to calculate the average selling price \u2014 a key measure in this new approach.\nJust look at the iPhone XS Max. Analysts suggest it\u2019s outselling the iPhone XS and that the 256GB model is its most popular configuration. TechInsights estimated it to cost $453 to build, but it\u2019s being sold at $1,249. Apple\u2019s margins have always been high, but they\u2019re getting increasingly ridiculous as the company becomes even more greedy by trying to suck as much money as possible out of its customers.\nApple will keep raising prices to see when its customers finally reach their collective breaking point, and while that seems to be happening for some, it clearly hasn\u2019t reached the point where the company sees the need to stop. The product line is increasingly a mess because profits are put before products, but that doesn\u2019t matter as long as investors keep seeing revenue growth, profit growth, and more money in their pockets \u2014 even if it comes out of those who have much less because they need to fork over so much to join or remain in the Apple ecosystem.\nIt\u2019s pure greed, and that\u2019s what Tim Cook\u2019s Apple is all about.",

        "title": "Amazon Is Kicking All Unauthorized Apple Refurbishers Off Amazon Marketplace",
        "body": "John Bumstead is a computer refurbisher who, every year, saves thousands of laptops from the shredder. He buys MacBooks en masse from electronics recyclers, fixes them, then sells them on Amazon Marketplace or wholesales them to vendors who do the same.\nFriday morning, Bumstead got an email from Amazon informing him that he\u2019d no longer be allowed to sell Apple computers on the platform, thanks to a new agreement between Apple and Amazon that will only allow \u201cauthorized resellers\u201d to sell Apple products.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAs part of a new agreement with Apple, we are working with a select group of authorized resellers to offer an expanded selection of Apple and Beats products, including new releases, in Amazon\u2019s stores,\u201d the email says. \u201cYou are receiving this message because you are currently selling, or have previously sold, Apple or Beats products. Your existing offers for those products will soon be removed from Amazon\u2019s online store in the United States. Please contact Apple if you would like to apply to become an authorized reseller on Amazon.\u201d\nAs the email notes, this is part of a new agreement between two of the largest companies in the world that will allow Amazon to sell new Apple products around the world; in exchange, Amazon agreed to let Apple pick-and-choose who is allowed to sell Apple products on the site.\nIt\u2019s the latest in Apple\u2019s long-running list of business decisions that allow it to lock down the repair, refurbishment, and end-of-life of its products.\n[Will this affect your business? Reach out to the reporter of this article on Signal at 347-513-3688]\nWhen I originally met Bumstead a few years ago, he described the prospect of being kicked off Amazon as a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d for his business and for other independent computer refurbishers and resellers. Bumstead says that Amazon Marketplace is by far the best platform for his business because Amazon has become so pervasive and is the first place that consumers think to buy things online. eBay and Craigslist are alternatives, but Amazon\u2019s popularity with customers and centralized shipping services have made it much easier for resellers to use it (Bumstead can ship 100 laptops to an Amazon fulfillment center, which then handles shipping them to individual customers.)\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThis is what every Amazon seller has been dreading,\u201d Bumstead told me on the phone. \u201cThere are hundreds if not thousands of small businesses that do repair and refurbishing, so they\u2019re going to take the biggest hit.\u201d\n\"Amazon is leveraging its power over its marketplace to give Apple power that the courts and Congress never have and never would\"\nApple will ultimately make the decisions about who will be allowed to become \"authorized resellers\" and what the requirements will be, according to the email that it sent to Bumstead. Apple did not respond to a request for comment, so for now we don\u2019t know how it is going to decide who can be an \u201cauthorized\u201d reseller on Amazon. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Apple places many restrictions on its \u201cauthorized\u201d service providers, who it grants permission to repair Apple devices. They are only allowed to work on certain devices, are only allowed to do certain repairs, and have to pay Apple to be accepted into the program.\nAaron Perzanowski, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University and coauthor of The End of Ownership, told me in an email that this decision is a dangerous infringement of ownership rights.\n\u201cWow. This is a very troubling development,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven Amazon\u2019s dominance as an online retail marketplace, its decision to disregard the first sale rights of resellers will significantly limit consumer choice. The fact that this move was demanded by Apple makes it even more problematic. What we see here are the world\u2019s two most valuable companies engaging in a coordinated assault on the lawful resale of consumer devices.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe United States Supreme Court has ruled that people who legally own a product may legally resell it, and federal law protects that right under something known as the \u201cfirst sale doctrine,\u201d which says that copyright holders give up their copyright to individual copies of a work once it is sold: \u201cthe first sale doctrine, codified at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, provides that an individual who knowingly purchases a copy of a copyrighted work from the copyright holder receives the right to sell, display, or otherwise dispose of that particular copy, notwithstanding the interests of the copyright owner,\u201d the US Department of Justice explains.\n\u201cThe first sale doctrine has never required an owner to get permission to sell their property,\u201d Perzanowski added. \u201cBut Amazon is leveraging its power over its marketplace to give Apple power that the courts and Congress never have and never would.\u201d\n\"It\u2019s kind of mind boggling to think that a brand would be able to restrict sale of used products\"\nKyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, told me on the phone that his company\u2019s iPhone replacement parts have been getting periodically removed from Amazon because of what he said were trademark enforcement claims by Apple. So far, he has been able to get them relisted after undergoing a lengthy dispute process with Amazon.\n\u201cThe idea you have a retailer that if they can strike a deal with the most profitable company in the world and lock out independent resellers is concerning for the future of commerce,\u201d Wiens said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of mind boggling to think that a brand would be able to restrict sale of used products. This is exactly the kind of control Apple wants to exert over the marketplace.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBumstead focuses on selling older MacBooks and MacBook Pros because they are generally easier to repair and acquire from recyclers. But his business likely has an expiration date: Apple\u2019s newest computers have a built-in software kill switch that prevents independent repair. On these models, which include the new MacBook Air and new MacBook Pros, the computers won\u2019t work unless Apple authorizes the repair via proprietary software on its servers.\nBumstead buys his computers from small electronics recyclers, (large recyclers are often required by Apple to shred Apple products as part of a contract they have with the company.) These old computers, which would otherwise be bound for a shredder still clearly have resale value, regardless of whether they look pristine when he resells them. Bumstead says that Amazon has always taken a \u201ccustomer is always right\u201d approach to repaired and refurbished goods, so the quality of repairs is presumably not a major concern for the company (Amazon did not tell me why it\u2019s making this change but said in an emailed statement that it is part of the new agreement with Apple.)\nUnlike eBay, where sellers create listings and then describe the quality and condition of the product, Amazon creates its own listings and sellers must meet the requirements of those listings. Bumstead said that there are \u201cgrades\u201d\u2014A, B, C, D, or \u201crefurbished,\u201d very good, used good, and used acceptable. \u201cYou designate the quality by one of those four grades, and then you can specify if there\u2019s, for example, a dent on the corner,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an unconditional 30 day warranty on every Amazon product, it has to be fully functional regardless of grade.\u201d\nAmazon currently has its own \u201ccertified\u201d refurbisher program called \u201cAmazon Renewed\u201d that will be unaffected by the new deal with Apple. But the requirements to sell Apple products under that program are impossible to hit for any small business: They must prove to Amazon that they spend at least $2.5 million dollars every 90 days buying Apple products \u201cdirectly from a national wireless carrier or retailer with over $5 billion in annual sales (Example: Verizon, AT&T, or Target) or the manufacturer (Apple.)\u201d This means that only big companies with direct relationships with corporate giants can meet the requirements.\n\u201cWho can meet that requirement except the top 5 massive companies that Apple has decided to work with?\u201d Bumstead said.\nThe new authorized reseller program will be separate from Amazon Renewed, and the requirements for the new program are not yet public. Amazon has told sellers that they can continue to sell Apple products on the site until January 4. After that, \u201cAmazon will reimburse you for the return or disposal fees through February 4, 2019.\u201d",

        "title": "Zuckerberg forced Facebook execs to switch to Android after being \u2018infuriated\u2019 by Tim Cook, report says",
        "body": "A new piece by The New York Times goes in-depth on how Facebook has handled its repeated breaches and blunders. But one detail in particular is fascinating relating to Apple, Mark Zuckerberg apparently forced his management team to give up iPhones and switch to Android after Tim Cook made some comments that \u201cinfuriated\u201d the Facebook CEO.\nThe NYT article titled Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook\u2019s Leaders Fought Through Crisis takes a close look at the social media company\u2019s approach to all the disasters it\u2019s seen.\nBut buried further in when discussing the Cambridge Analytica scandal is an interesting story about how mad Zuckerberg was about some of Tim Cook\u2019s comments on the situation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to traffic in your personal life,\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. \u201cPrivacy to us is a human right. It\u2019s a civil liberty.\u201d (Mr. Cook\u2019s criticisms infuriated Mr. Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones, since the operating system has far more users than Apple\u2019s.\nThe quote looks to be from Tim Cook\u2019s interview with MSNBC hosted by Chris Hayes and Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher from earlier this year. In addition to the quote above, Cook had another zinger for Zuckerberg:\nTo no surprise Swisher and Hayes brought up the Facebook controversy, and Cook had a sharp response to the question of what would he do if he was in Zuckerburg\u2019s shoes, saying \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in this situation,\u201d to roaring audience laughter and applause.\nZuckerburg later responded with the following:\nYou know, I find that argument, that if you\u2019re not paying that somehow we can\u2019t care about you, to be extremely glib \u2013 and not at all aligned with the truth. If you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something people can afford. I think it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t all get Stockholm syndrome, and let the companies that work hard to charge you more, convince you that they actually care more about you, because that sounds ridiculous to me.\nIt\u2019s fascinating to hear that behind the scenes Zuckerberg was allegedly so angry about Cook\u2019s comments that he forced his management team to abandon their iPhones and pick up Android smartphones.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "body": "Amazon has made a deal with Apple that will see the Cupertino tech company sell its products \u2014 including iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches \u2014 directly on Amazon, according to a report from CNET.\nAmazon has sold Apple products before, but those have been from third-party sellers, which means that the prices are often variable (and wildly different from the \u201cofficial\u201d Apple prices) and that sourcing isn\u2019t as reputable.\nRolling out on Amazon sites in the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, and India over the next few weeks\nApple products will start rolling out on Amazon sites in the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, and India over the next few weeks, including both Apple\u2019s devices and those sold under the Apple-owned Beats brand. The deal doesn\u2019t include every Apple product, though. For example, Apple\u2019s Echo-competing HomePod is notably not going to be sold on Amazon.\nIn a statement released to The Verge, an Amazon spokesperson commented, \u201cAmazon is constantly working to enhance the customer experience, and one of the ways we do this is by increasing selection of the products we know customers want. We look forward to expanding our assortment of Apple and Beats products globally.\u201d\nAs part of the deal, only Apple or Apple-authorized resellers will now be allowed to sell Apple and Beats devices through Amazon\u2019s site. Any companies that are currently selling Apple products on Amazon will see their listings taken down starting on January 4th, and they\u2019ll need to apply to Apple to become official resellers before they\u2019ll be allowed to sell them again on Amazon.",

        "title": "Poll: Would you accept a slightly thicker 2019 iPhone in return for three benefits?",
        "body": "Macworld has a wishlist piece on the 2019 iPhone. Some of it is uncontroversial and very likely to happen \u2013 things like a better neural engine and improved Face ID (including landscape operation, like the new iPad Pro).\nBut the site\u2019s Jason Cross also proposes something Apple is extremely unlikely to do: making the 2019 iPhone a little thicker \u2026\nHere\u2019s the pitch: make the new iPhone just one millimeter thicker. That would take it to 8.7mm, less than a half-millimeter thicker than the iPhone XR! It would still look and feel ultra-premium.\nWhy? Cross suggests it could offer three benefits:\nLose the camera bump\nIncrease the battery capacity\nAccommodate a USB-C port in place of Lightning\nIf we\u2019re willing to countenance a thicker iPhone, the first two benefits seem no-brainers. The camera bump is something many of us feel spoils the aesthetics of Apple\u2019s recent iPhones, and battery-life is an extremely common pain point.\nI never hear anyone complain that the iPhone isn\u2019t thin enough. Or that other premium phones, like the Galaxy S9 or the Pixel 3, are too thick. I hear everyone complain that they want longer battery life.\nThe third point is more controversial. Changing a long-used port always sparks everything from concern to outrage, but Cross suggests the 2019 iPhone would be the right time to make the switch.\nIt\u2019s time to unify the system. Apple\u2019s all-in with USB-C on the Mac; it doesn\u2019t put any other ports on Mac laptops, and iMacs have an abundance of USB-C ports. Just make everyone\u2019s life easier and swap Lightning for USB-C on all iPhones and iPads. Give us one cable to rule them all.\nI made my own pitch for this earlier in the year. The most persuasive objection was that Apple is clearly on a path that will see the end of all ports on iOS devices, so why have two lots of upheaval \u2013 why not just wait for a fully wireless iPhone? That\u2019s a fair point, but now that the iPad has made the switch, that does add weight to the argument that the iPhone should do it too.\nBut whatever your view on that, would 1mm more thickness be justified in the 2019 iPhone for either two or three of the proposed benefits?

        "title": "Apple considering offline mode for Siri that could process voice locally on an iPhone",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nApple wants Siri to become more useful to users when not connected to the internet, including the possibility of an offline mode that does not rely on a backend server to assist with voice recognition or performing the required task, one that would be entirely performed on the user's device.\nThe way Siri typically works is that it listens to the user command when prompted, sends anonymized received speech data to Apple's servers, first converting from audio to plain text, then interpreting the command and sending the result back to the user's iPhone or iPad. The process of performing speech recognition is intensive, and is offloaded from devices to Apple's servers as it isn't necessarily capable of being performed on an item like an iPhone.\nIn the case of Siri, the reliance on servers means the virtual assistant isn't available if there isn't some form of internet connection, though the \"Hey Siri\" prompt will still trigger the service, if only to then display the offline message. According to an Apple patent application filing published on Thursday for an \"Offline personal assistant,\" things may change in the future.\nRather than connected to Apple's servers, the filing suggests the speech-to-text processing and validation could happen on the device itself. On hearing the user make a request, the device in question will be capable of determining the task via onboard natural language processing, working out if the requested task as it hears it is useful, then performing it.\nApple suggests the use of an onboard system of modules to handle digital assistant queries that does not connect to the outside world. The collection of modules includes elements for speech synthesis, dialog processing, phonetic alphabet conversion based on a default vocabulary and user-created data, and a natural language processing module, among other items.\nDepending on the recognized words and the structure of the query, the offline digital assistant could then perform a number of predefined tasks stored in the task flow processing module or service processing module. These two stores contain models for commonly-requested tasks, such as setting a timer or to play a song saved to the device, with the appropriate task model performed depending on the request.\nAs part of the filing, Apple does suggest the use of machine learning mechanisms to perform specific types of task, including natural language processing. Such systems would be able to understand contextual information, making them extremely useful for determining what the user wants from a limited amount of on-device data, without accessing the internet.\nEven with the on-device processing for offline use, the proposed system would still be able to go online if a connection is available, making the same system work in two different ways depending on the available connectivity.\nHaving access to local and remote processing would also provide the digital assistant two possible interpretations for the user's speech. In such cases, the system would determine a usefulness score for the locally-processed interpretation as well as that of the online-processed version, and perform the task based on which of the two processes scored higher.\nThis would effectively give the assistant a backup option, allowing the server-based processing to be used as an alternate interpretation if the locally-performed processing on the request comes up with an unusable result. In the event the server version times out or becomes unavailable, the local version is still available to use for the task.\nTypically Apple files for many patents on a weekly basis, and while the concepts described do suggest areas where Apple has an interest, they are not guarantees that such systems will be included in the company's future products.\nIn the case of offline Siri, it seems quite plausible for Apple to go down this route. In its more recent iPhone launches, the A-series processor has included the Neural Engine, which is intended to perform computationally intensive tasks such as Face ID authentication and powering photography-related features, but it can also be used for tasks that use machine learning.\nConsidering the power of the second-generation Neural Engine used in the 2018 iPhone releases, it is entirely possible for an offline Siri to take advantage of the available power and machine learning capabilities to perform offline processing.\nAn offline mode is not the only way Apple could improve Siri, as it has worked on a number of different concepts to make the digital assistant better. One October patent explains how Siri could recognize specific users by their \"voice print,\" with Apple also looking into enabling multi-user support with personalized responses.\nSiri has already received some improvements relating to its recognition capabilities, including geographical voice models to help aid with regional queries and local language quirks. More visible to consumers is the introduction of Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12, which allows users to make their own personal Siri commands.",

        "body": "Apple is introducing a new \u201cRepair Vintage Apple Products Pilot\u201d program that will extend the period of time customers can receive repairs for older devices, according to sources familiar with the initiative. The new program at first will include the iPhone 5 and other Apple products that are about to become obsolete, and in the coming weeks will add more products to the list for devices that previously lost repair support.\nOf note, the list also includes the 5+ year old Mid-2012 MacBook Air models following the introduction of an updated MacBook Air at the company\u2019s event earlier this week.\nThe full list of devices that currently fall under Apple\u2019s new program include:\niPhone 5 (GSM/CDMA)\nMacBook Air (11 inch, Mid 2012)\nMacBook Air (13 inch, Mid 2012)\niMac (21.5 inch, Mid 2011) \u2013 US and Turkey only\niMac (27 inch, Mid 2011) \u2013 US and Turkey only\nApple will also soon add more devices including the iPhone 4s and MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012) on Nov, 30, 2018. That will be followed by the MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012), MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2013), MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012), Mac Pro (Mid 2012), and iPhone 5 (GSM) on December, 30, 2018. The program covers the devices above at Apple stores and authorized service providers worldwide unless otherwise noted.\nApple has long had a 5-7 year lifespan for repairing its products, meaning that owners of an iPhone, iPad or Mac can have repairs performed through Apple or an authorized service provider even when not under warranty. Usually after 5-7 years, products are then classified as \u201cvintage\u201d or \u201cobsolete\u201d (depending on the country and local laws) and Apple staff no longer offers parts or repairs. The company maintains a list of products that are classified as vintage and obsolete on its website.\nFor the new Pilot program, Apple will only be offering repairs for vintage devices based on part availability. Otherwise customers will be told that inventory isn\u2019t available because the product is considered vintage. So the new program doesn\u2019t guarantee you a repair, but it\u2019s a nice change from Apple\u2019s previous policy where it stopped offering repairs entirely after classifying devices as vintage.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

Read our ethics policy\nA graph showing iOS 12's adoption rate, according to Mixpanel's data\nThird-party analytics data suggests the adoption of iOS 12 on active iPhones and iPads has reached 75 percent, continuing a trend where the latest milestone release of Apple's mobile operating system continues to outpace iOS 11.\nAccording to data from analytics firm Mixpanel, iOS 12 achieved 75.01 percent penetration of active iOS devices on November 26, marking the first time it was seen to be used on three quarters of compatible devices. The data also reveals the level has continued to increase slowly since then, reaching 75.06 percent on November 28.\nBy contrast, iOS 11 is shown to be going down at a similar rate. On November 26, iOS 11 was used on 19.58 percent of compatible devices, with the remainder consisting of older iOS releases.\nThe results show that, at least by the measuring mechanisms used by the firm, iOS 12's adoption rate is continuing to outpace that of iOS 11 last year, by a considerable margin. In 2017, iOS 11 reached the 75 percent barrier on December 18, with the release taking a few weeks longer.\nInitial data for the first 48 hours of iOS 12's release suggested it was actually lagging behind iOS 11 by a few percentage points, though later results showed growth of iOS 12 had improved.\nWhile the adoption data is useful, the firm acquires the information via indirect means, such as by acquiring analytics data from various sources, rather than from Apple directly. This does make the results potentially inaccurate, but the changes in adoption over time is still a good indicator of where iOS 12 is heading in terms of usage.",

        "body": "AAPL has dipped below the $200 mark at times today, and is down around 10 percent since Apple's earnings report last week, resulting in the company losing its trillion dollar valuation in terms of market capitalization. As of writing, Apple has a market cap of around $950 billion based on its latest share count.\nApple on Thursday reported revenue of $62.9 billion during the fourth quarter of its 2018 fiscal year, an all-time record for the July-September period, but the good news was overshadowed by Apple's revelation that it will no longer disclose iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales on a unit basis starting next quarter.\nThe news has sparked concerns among some analysts and investors that Apple may have something to hide, as iPhone unit sales in particular were essentially flat last quarter and could begin to decline in upcoming quarters.\nApple's financial chief Luca Maestri said unit sales are \"not particularly relevant for our company at this point,\" as they are \"not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business.\" He added that Apple may provide qualitative commentary related to unit sales if the info is valuable to investors.\nAAPL is also being dragged down by a questionable report claiming Apple has informed its suppliers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR due to \"disappointing demand\" for the smartphone.\nNot everyone believes Apple's decision to stop reporting unit sales is a bad one. Apple bull Brian White at Monness Crespi Hardt believes the change \"makes perfect sense\" as Apple's success is \"increasingly driven by an ecosystem of product and services on Planet Apple,\" including rising ASPs.\nApple analyst Gene Munster of Loup Ventures also believes the change will be \"a good thing for Apple investors,\" as \"the new reporting method will force the Street to think about Apple's business as a stable and growing service, which should yield a higher earnings multiple in the long run.\"\nAAPL is currently hovering around $199-$201 on the intraday market, down from a closing price of $222.22 on Thursday.",

        "body": "Volkswagen is deepening its relationship with Apple on its VW Car-Net app. iOS users can now use Siri to lock and unlock their car, check estimate mileage with the fuel or charge left in their vehicle, and enable alarms.\nVW owners can use Siri to start and stop a charging session for their electric car or to turn on the defroster. They can also set a specific temperature and locate their car.\nCart-Net isn\u2019t free to all VW owners, though: the app costs a specific subscription fee per month. It allows vehicle owners to pinpoint their car\u2019s location, set a geofence for it, and access diagnostics remotely.\nThe Shortcuts feature is particularly nifty, especially if users can develop a morning routine around it. I\u2019d imagine people in cold areas would want to remotely start their defroster and set the inside temperature.\nDoing it all in one step might not save that much time, but in the long run, it\u2019s a nice feature. Apple debuted Siri Shortcuts with iOS 12, which is required for this new Volkswagen functionality. So far, we haven\u2019t seen anything terribly impressive, but features like this make it clear that while it might not revolutionize our lives, it could make certain app actions more seamless.",

        "title": "DriveSavers claims it has a way to break into locked iPhones with 100 percent success",
        "body": "Data recovery company DriveSavers is advertising a new service that claims it can recover sensitive data from a locked smartphone, including notably difficult-to-crack iOS devices. The company\u2019s service, called Passcode Lockout Data Recovery, is advertised for regular consumers and not seemingly designed for law enforcement or any other type of official cybersecurity business. Yet The Verge was unable to directly verify the efficacy of the tool, and the offer goes against many promises made by Apple about the security of its storage.\n\u201cThe first-of-its-kind service is being offered exclusively to consumers who have forgotten device passwords, been locked out after too many incorrect attempts, and for those who need access to data stored on the device of a deceased family member,\u201d reads the company\u2019s press release. \u201cOther companies offer a similar service only to law enforcement. DriveSavers is the first to offer a Passcode Lockout Data Recovery service to consumers. The DriveSavers service is not available for law enforcement and requires proof of ownership prior to unlocking a device.\u201d\nIn an email to The Verge, a DriveSavers spokesperson says the service costs $3,900 per device, but the company claims it will return your phone or tablet to you unlocked. \u201cDepending on the situation, we may request death certificates, probate documents, court documents, or other legal documents. In the case of a death, we verify who is the executor of the state through interview and documentation,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nDriveSavers won\u2019t say exactly how its passcode bypass works\nThe company says the service is primarily designed for the family members of deceased loved ones to access locked devices, but it would not disclose exactly how it\u2019s able to bypass security protocols on iOS or on Android devices. DriveSavers is also advertising its service for Windows machines, and the devices of numerous manufacturers like Huawei, Lenovo, LG, and ZTE.\nOf course, these claims invite some serious skepticism. Apple\u2019s iPhone is protected by a passcode lock system that not even the FBI were able to bypass on its own, instigating an infamous showdown between Apple and the agency two years ago over the unlocking of the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone 5C. (Apple refused to build a special version of its operating system for the FBI that would include a backdoor. The FBI sued, but eventually dropped the case.)\nThat\u2019s because the passcode on an iPhone is encrypted, so not even Apple is able to access a device once it is locked. There are ways to remotely wipe the device, but retrieving information like texts, photos, and other on-device data not stored in the cloud is supposed to be technically impossible, at least not without exploiting a high-level vulnerability.\nThe FBI ultimately purchased the service of a third-party company, reportedly for upward of $1 million, the details of which a federal judge ruled the FBI did not have to ultimately disclose to the public for fear it could be used by foreign adversaries. Nevertheless, the exploit used in that case is believed to no longer work, as it relied on the software architecture of an older version of iOS.\nThere are methods to retrieve information from a locked iPhone via iCloud by going through Apple directly with a search warrant, but that\u2019s not a standard procedure for your everyday consumer, and it does not appear to be what DriveSavers claim to have access to. There are also ways to spoof fingerprint data to access a device via Touch ID, as well as methods law enforcement have used to exploit weaknesses in the way iOS treats USB devices, most notably the GrayKey hacking tool used by some law enforcement agencies until Apple developed a method to block it completely.",

        "body": "Apple has reportedly acquired Silk Labs, a little-known startup which focused on building on-device machine learning software.\nThe purchase, which took place earlier this year according to The Information, would be a natural fit for Apple\u2019s privacy-centric approach to AI. After an unsuccessful foray into the smart home, Silk Labs developed on-device machine learning services. This means processing data without sending it to the cloud \u2014 a method that Apple has also preferred.\nSilk Labs itself is not a familiar name in tech. The company was cofounded by former Mozilla CTO Andreas Gal and launched only one product: an \u201cintelligent camera and hub for your smart home\u201d name Sense. The hub was stylish and well-designed, and intended to connect together smart home products including thermostats, speakers, and cameras.\nSilk Labs unveiled only one hardware product, the smart home hub Sense. It was cancelled in June 2016 after raising funds on Kickstarter. Credit: Silk Labs\nSense launched on Kickstarter in February 2016 but received only around $150,000 in funding from 774 backers. Silk Labs cancelled the product in June that year (refunding backers), and announced that it was pivoting to developing AI software for other firms.\nThe company\u2019s website (still live at the time of writing) details a range of services that draw on machine vision technology. These include people detection and facial recognition for tasks like building surveillance, retail analytics, and home security. On the company\u2019s site and on social media, it stresses that its use of edge computing and encryption make its services more private than those of rivals.\nApple has taken a similar approach in its development of AI, differentiating itself from rivals like Google, which collects substantial amounts of user data and processes it in the cloud. \u201dWhen it comes to performing analysis of your data,\u201d Apple exec Craig Federighi said in 2016. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it on your devices, keeping your personal data under your control.\u201d",

        "body": "Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak sat down for an interview today with CNBC. In the interview, he touched on several topics, including what he thinks of Apple today.\nWoz started out by saying that he loves that Apple is continuing to put people above technology, noting that Steve Jobs would be \u201cvery happy with Apple today.\u201d\nI believe that he would be very happy with the company today and its concern more with end users and putting people above technology. Steve always acted that way. The users should be more important than the technology itself. You should not be a victim of the technology and what it can do. You should get to live your human life in the most human way possible.\nHe goes on to say that other smartphone manufacturers aren\u2019t really innovating. Instead, they are just creating fun features. Meanwhile, Apple is focusing on innovations that \u201cliterally affect everything we do all the time in life.\u201d He believes that new features aren\u2019t inherently innovative. For example, on various Android phones you can smile and the phone takes a picture. Woz says it\u2019s a \u201cfun feature\u201d, but it\u2019s not \u201cinnovation.\u201d\nThe co-founder then went on to talk about \u201creal innovation\u201d that \u201cchanges our life.\u201d In his example, he talked about Apple Pay with Touch ID.\nEvery other phone company had to come along and copy Apple. Apple was the first one to come up with an easy to pay system. Don\u2019t even turn your phone on, don\u2019t unlock it, don\u2019t find an app, don\u2019t type in a credit card number pin. Just hold your phone over the device and put your finger on it to identify yourself.\nOf course, on later iOS devices including the 2018 iPad Pro, Apple has replaced Touch ID with Face ID. In most cases, Apple\u2019s facial recognition system requires no user interaction (aside from double tapping the Side/Top button for purchases).\nWhat Woz says makes sense. Apple\u2019s vision has always been user experience at the core and that continues today. Sure, one could debate whether or not details such as software bugs and hardware flaws have seen a decline over the years. Or if Apple is lagging behind on adding new features, such as OLED on iPhone or improvements to Siri.\nBut, at the core, the company is still putting people first. For example, the company\u2019s stance on privacy and its vertical integration with its software, hardware, and services.\nCheck out the full clip below:",

This development comes in from the city of Federal Way, Washington in the US where a user claims that his 10-month old iPhone X \"just got hot and exploded in the process of upgrading to [iOS 12.1]\".\nGadgets 360 reached out to Rahel Mohamad, owner of the iPhone X in question, to find out the details of the incident he first tweeted about.\n\u201cThis year early January I bought the iPhone and have been using it normally.\u201d he said. The iPhone X was in process of getting updated to iOS 12.1 when, Mohamad says, he put it on charging. At a later stage, he says, \u201cDark grey smoke started coming from the phone. The update was completed and as soon as the phone turned on it started to smoke and caught fire.\u201d\nMohamad, who told Gadgets 360 the incident occurred in Federal Way, Washington, claims he was using the official bundled Apple Lightning cable and wall adapter to charge his iPhone. However, he says that he had stop charging the phone before the \"explosion\".\n\u201cWhen I held the phone it was very hot and I drop the phone immediately. Then it started to smoke.\u201d he added.\nMohamad claims he used the original cable and adapter to charge his iPhone X\nPhoto Credit: Twitter/ Rahel Mohamad\nHe says that he has reached out to Apple which wishes to investigate the incident further by getting Mohamad to ship the iPhone X to them. In a reply on Twitter to his original tweet, Apple Support said that this is definitely not expected behaviour and would wish to resolve it soon. We have also reached out to Apple and will update the story as and when we receive a response.\nThat's definitely not expected behavior. DM us, so we can look into this with you: https://t.co/GDrqU22YpT \u2014 Apple Support (@AppleSupport) November 14, 2018\nWhile definitely a serious issue for the user, this is a rare occurrence considering there have been no widespread reports of exploding iPhone X units since its launch last year, so this is unlikely to be another Samsung Galaxy Note 7 fiasco.\nTo recall, Apple's iPhone X was launched late last year and its design change marked the tenth anniversary of the company's legendary iPhone range. The design was brought forward to this year, with the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max smartphones also featuring an OLED display and notch, with the third phone - the iPhone XR - also taking some of the design philosophies forward, though with an LCD display.",

Find out more about how we test .\nUpdate on March 18, 2020: Apple unveiled a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro (2020) with loads of new features, including a Magic Keyboard accessory with a trackpad.\nApple likes to say that the iPad Pro is a computer, not a tablet. I beg to differ. But it is much more than a tablet.\nWhatever you want to call it, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (from $999; $1,327 with keyboard and Apple Pencil) is one of the most powerful mobile devices ever made. The A12X Bionic processor in this slate runs circles around even Core i7-powered laptops on certain tasks, and yet the device weighs just 1.4 pounds.\nApple has given the iPad Pro an iPhone X-style makeover as well, complete with a full-screen design, Face ID and a gesture-based interface (meaning no more Home button). And the new Apple Pencil feels better in your hand while offering useful gestures. Oh, and the battery life is bonkers, at well over 13 hours.\nIs the iPad Pro a laptop replacement? Not for me. However, if you like the idea of interacting primarily via touch or Pencil, you'll be floored by the sheer performance and versatility of this slate. This iPad Pro more than earned its spot on our Best Tablets and Best Kids Tablets page.\niPad Pro (2018) 12.9-inch price and configuration options\nThe 12.9-inch iPad Pro starts at $999 for the Wi-Fi model with 64GB of storage. The $129 Apple Pencil and $199 keyboard bring the price to a fairly steep $1,327. See how Apple's smart keyboard folio compares to the best iPad Pro keyboard cases at our face-off. That's MacBook Pro territory. Adding LTE costs $250, getting you the Wi-Fi + Cellular model.\nIf I were spending my own money, I would pay a little bit more and get the 256GB version, which would bring the total cost with the accessories to $1,477. For our review, Apple sent us the 1TB Wi-Fi + Cellular model, which starts at $1,899 for just the tablet and costs $2,227 when you throw in the Pencil and keyboard. Gulp.\niPad Pro (2018) 12.9-inch design\nThe 12.9-inch iPad Pro is still imposing, but now that's because of a much more immersive display and not because of the device's sheer footprint. Apple blasted away the big bezels from the previous model to deliver something that's almost all screen.\nApple ditched the Home button while stretching the Liquid Retina display to the corners using the same techniques (such as pixel masking) the company employed on the iPhone XR. This is not an iPhone writ large, though, as the aluminum iPad Pro's design is less playful and more industrial-chic, with perfectly flat sides and gently rounded corners.\nApple blasted away the big bezels from the previous model to deliver something that's almost all screen.\nThis slate is smaller in every dimension than the last iPad Pro, as well as lighter. The new iPad Pro 12.9 measures 11 x 8.4 x 0.23 inches and weighs 1.39 pounds (1.4 pounds for the LTE model), compared to the 12 x 8.7 x 0.27-inch design on the 2017 model, which also weighed a heftier 1.49 (Wi-Fi) to 1.53 pounds (Wi-Fi + Cellular).\nThe Surface Pro 6 is narrower than the iPad Pro but taller and thicker, at 11.5 x 7.9 x 0.33 inches, and heavier, at 1.7 pounds. In my hands, the new iPad Pro felt wonderfully thin, but you'll definitely notice its weight after a few minutes.\nThis slate is really best for using in your lap, whether you're drawing or typing. But it's fine for use in short stints while you're standing.\nThe other big (and overdue) design change on the iPad Pro 12.9 is the USB-C port, which enables users to connect the tablet to an external monitor (up to 5K), digital cameras and other devices. Some users will lament that the headphone jack got zapped as well, but many of us have already moved on to wireless headphones, anyway.\nOverall, I like the design of the iPad Pro, but I wish Apple had included a kickstand like the Surface Pro 6 and Galaxy Book 2 have.\nIf your new iPad Pro looks bent, even though it just came out of the box, you're not crazy or looking at it wrong. Apple admitted that a slight, visible curve is the result of its manufacturing process. Specifically, the bend is a result of the tablet's metal and plastic parts cooling down. If you notice this within the first 14 days, you can exchange your iPad under Apple's return policy.\niPad Pro (2018) 12.9-inch display\nIt would be a total waste of $999 (or more) to use the iPad Pro 12.9 just for bingeing Netflix, but damn does this screen look good. I streamed Ugly Delicious, a show about food, and this panel made a brick oven look mesmerizing. It looked so good I had to pause the frame when it showed the rich orange flames and oozy pizza cheese up close.\nAccording to our lab tests, the iPad Pro averages 484 nits of brightness, which beats scores from both the Surface Pro 6 (408 nits) and Samsung Galaxy Book 2 (350 nits).\nThis LCD can reproduce 128.4 percent of the sRGB color gamut and registered a Delta-E color-accuracy score of 0.29 (0 is perfect). The Galaxy Book 2's OLED display is more colorful, reaching 200.2 percent of sRGB, but it's not as accurate (0.31), while the Surface Pro 6 produced slightly more colors than the iPad (136 percent) but with worse accuracy (0.56).\nMORE: Apple Reveals New MacBook Air, iPad Pro and Mac mini\nThe display on the iPad Pro 12.9 benefits from other technologies as well, such as ProMotion. This enables the panel to scale its refresh rate automatically up to 120 Hz, depending on the task. There's also True Tone, which can change the color temperature of the display based on ambient lighting to make reading easier on the eyes.\niPad Pro (2018) 12.9-inch audio\nWhoa. That's what I said to myself when I listened to Bruno Mars' \"Perm\" blasting through the iPad Pro's four-speaker audio system. Compared to what you get from the Surface Pro 6, the new iPad's sound wasn't just louder and clearer; the bass guitar and bottom end overall were just more present on the Apple slate.\nThe iPad Pro also includes five microphones, which come in handy for FaceTime calls but also Siri queries. In fact, the iPad Pro heard me from several feet away in a conference room when I said, \"Hey, Siri,\" and asked about the weather.\niPad Pro (2018) 12.9-inch Apple Pencil\nThe new Apple Pencil is now pricier, at $129, but it's a big improvement over the original. For starters, it's a cinch to dock this Pencil with the iPad Pro, thanks to a built-in magnet. The Pencil starts charging as soon as it attaches.\nI tried shaking the iPad Pro hard with the Pencil attached, and it didn't come loose. The Pencil also stayed put after I walked a mile with the iPad Pro stuffed in my backpack, but it did come loose one time while I was taking the tablet out of my bag.\nThe new Apple Pencil also feels better in the hand, as there's a flat edge. Plus, you can activate various shortcuts with a double tap, such as quickly pulling up the eraser. And with a quick tap, you can go straight into the Notes app when the iPad Pro's screen is off.\nThe new Apple Pencil is now pricier, at $129, but it's a big improvement over the original.\nI handed the new iPad Pro to our deputy director of photography, Jef Castro, who also happens to be a great illustrator, and here's what he said: \"My favorite update, as simple as it may sound, is the flat edge, which felt much better in my hand and made for a better grip. I say this as someone who gets minor hand cramps from the previous Pencil after continuous use.\"\nJef also liked all the improvements, from the magnetic charging to the double tap, which created a much smoother experience for him. Unfortunately, the Apple Pencil works with only the new iPad Pros; it's not backward-compatible with previous iPad Pros.\niPad Pro (2018) 12.9-inch performance\nThe 7-nanometer A12X Bionic chip inside the iPad Pro is so fast we almost did a spit take when we tested the CPU in our labs. This processor packs four performance cores and four high-efficiency cores, and there's a new GPU that promises twice the graphics performance as the A10X processor inside the last iPad Pro provided.\nOn Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the iPad Pro 12.9-inch turned in a multicore score of 17,995, which smokes scores from the Surface Pro 6 with its Core i5 CPU (13,025) and even the Core i7-powered Dell XPS 13 (14,180).\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon 850-powered Galaxy Book 2 (3,945) is not even in the same universe as the iPad Pro. Qualcomm has announced a new Snapdragon 8cx chip for laptops and 2-in-1s, but that won't start appearing in devices until the third quarter of 2019.\nThe 12.9-inch iPad Pro also crushed the competition when we turned to video editing.\nTranscoding a 4K clip to 1080p in the Adobe Rush app took just 7 minutes and 47 seconds on the iPad Pro, while the Dell XPS 13 took 31:03 and the Surface Pro 6 took 31:54. The latest 2018 13-inch MacBook Pro completed the task in 25:53.\nThe gap wasn't as great when we exported 100 raw photos in Adobe Lightroom on the iPad Pro, but Apple's tablet still came out on top.\nThe iPad Pro took 59 seconds, while the XPS 13 took a little more than 2 minutes. The 13-inch MacBook Pro and Surface Pro 6 were in the middle, at 1:35 and 1:36, respectively.\nAll of that A12X horsepower also comes in handy when using AR apps like Plantale. My colleagues were floored when I placed a big sunflower in the middle of the newsroom, and then the app let me zoom in on a highly detailed cross section of a leaf to see the photosynthesis process. Apps like this can change the face of education.\nThis iPad has serious game, too, as I found when I fought as Superman in Injustice 2. This resource-intensive title loaded in less than 10 seconds, and the action never stuttered, even on a giant, 12.9-inch display as I frantically punched and kicked.\nMORE: New iPad Pro Beats XPS 13, MacBook Pro in Leaked Benchmarks\nHowever, that game isn't even fully optimized for the iPad Pro. Assassin's Creed Identity and a new version of NBA 2K19 both look impressive, but we'll have to see if those and other titles are really Xbox One S-quality, as Apple claims.\niPad Pro (2018) 12.9-inch battery life\nThis is impressive. On the Laptop Mag Battery Test, the iPad Pro 12.9 inch lasted 13 hours and 14 minutes. That beats the Surface Pro's time (9:20) by nearly 4 hours. The ARM-powered Galaxy Book 2 mustered a good-but-not-great 10:41.\nDespite the inclusion of USB-C, the iPad Pro 12.9 inch doesn't offer fast charging. We will update this review with full test results, but this slate took about an hour to charge to 20 percent.\nMy biggest gripe with the iPad Pro is the short, 1-meter power cable. It didn't even reach to my kitchen table from a very close wall. Apple sells a 2-meter USB-C cable for $19, but that accessory should have been included.\niPad Pro (2018) 12.9-inch iOS 12 (and iPadOS)\nUsing the iPad Pro in iOS 12 feels a lot more intuitive and productive than you might think. This is not just a big iPhone. You can easily run two apps side by side, provided they're optimized for the software. For example, I could easily drag an image out of Photos into an outgoing message I had composed in Mail.\nMy biggest gripe with the iPad Pro is the short power cable.\nIf you swipe up from the bottom of the screen, you can close an app, but swiping up slightly will show the Dock. Swiping down from the top right will display the Control Center, for tweaking settings on the fly. You can also quickly switch between open apps just by swiping from left to right toward the bottom of the screen.\nHowever, I think the keyboard integration with iOS should be better. For example, you can't just type on the Home screen to search for apps. You have to swipe down from the top of the screen first. It's a similar deal for the Settings menu. You shouldn't have to tap the Search bar first when you have the keyboard attached.\nLater this year, though, the iPad's operating system changes its name, as Apple releases iPadOS. Wondering how iPadOS will stand out from iOS 13? We've got a full guide to iPadOS' exclusive features. And if that makes you curious enough to want to try the public beta, check out our tutorial for how to install the iPadOS public beta.\niPad Pro (2018) 12.9-inch cameras\nYou will look silly using a 12.9-inch tablet to take photos and videos, but you'll be glad to know that the 12-MP camera on the iPad's back takes sharp pics.\nAnd this camera uses the same smart HDR feature as the latest iPhones have to bring out more highlights.\nTake this photo of mums, for example. The iPad Pro delivered fairly good detail in the petal, and the pinks and yellows were rich without being overly saturated.\nThe iPad Pro also did a good job capturing this scene in Bryant Park. The holiday lights are fairly distinct, though the trees in the background could be a little sharper.\nThe front 7-MP camera on the iPad Pro can take Portraits, complete with the ability to tweak the depth control for a nice bokeh effect (after you shoot but not before). But for some reason, Apple didn't give the back camera Portrait mode support.\nBottom line\nThe iPad Pro is the quintessential tablet for power users and creative pros. It's so fast that I imagine the likes of Qualcomm and Intel are getting nervous. This tablet wiped the floor with premium Windows laptops and 2-in-1s, in both benchmarks and real-world tests. The iPad Pro's display, sound and battery life are also top-notch, and the improved Apple Pencil is more comfortable and easier to store.\nHowever, it's going to take some time for developers to tap the potential of the A12X Bionic chip. For instance, a fully optimized version of Photoshop for the iPad is shipping in 2019, complete with Apple Pencil and touch support -- not a watered-down Photoshop, but the real deal.\nIf you're looking for a true laptop replacement, the Surface Pro 6 is a better option. It's not as speedy, but Microsoft's 2-in-1 offers a more comfortable keyboard with a touchpad and a true desktop environment.\nThen again, Apple didn't set out to create a 2-in-1. The company wanted to deliver the ultimate mobile device for those who like the idea of using touch and Pencil input most of the time. And if you're in that target audience, nothing comes close to the iPad Pro.",

        "title": "Apple iPad Pro review 2018: the fastest iPad is still an iPad",
        "body": "Apple introduced the new iPad Pro with a spectacular series of statistics that made laptops seem like old news. More iPads are sold than any other company\u2019s entire laptop lineup! The new iPad Pro with an eight-core A12X processor is faster than 92 percent of portable PCs sold today! The graphics performance is 1000 times faster than the first-generation iPad and now rivals an Xbox One S! It has a USB-C port that can drive 5K displays!\nAll of this data was used to support equally spectacular claims about what an iPad really is. It is a \u201cmagical piece of glass that can be anything you need it to be,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said, adding that all that power is \u201cgoing to push what you can do on iPad, or on any computer, even further.\u201d The overwhelming message was the iPad is more powerful, more capable, and more the future than any laptop \u2014 Apple\u2019s own new MacBook Air included.\nBut computers are about more than just sales and processor specs: they\u2019re about software. And the one thing Apple didn\u2019t really change on the iPad Pro is iOS 12, which has all of the same capabilities and limitations iPad users have come to expect. Apple wants you to think that the iPad Pro is the future of computing, but if you\u2019ve already used iOS 12 on an iPad Pro, you know exactly how you feel about that idea.\n7.5 Verge Score Apple iPad Pro (2018) $ 779 The Good Beautiful, high refresh rate display\nUSB-C port makes life easier\nApple Pencil is far more practical\nExtremely powerful The Bad Expensive\nNo USB-C storage device support\nNo headphone jack\niPad app ecosystem underdeveloped and feature-limited\niOS limitations are extremely frustrating $799 at Apple$799 at Amazon$779 at Walmart How we rate and review products\nApple gave me a completely maxed-out 12.9-inch iPad Pro with 1TB of storage, LTE, and the optional $199 Smart Keyboard Folio and $129 Apple Pencil to review. That makes for $2,227 of iPad Pro \u2014 more than all but one standard MacBook Pro configuration. It is impossible to look at a device this powerful and expensive and not expect it to replace a laptop for day-to-day work.\nIt\u2019s also impossible to look at the iPad Pro and not be struck by its design. This is the first truly new Apple mobile hardware design in a long while, and it has a deeper connection to the MacBook Pro than the iPhone or previous iPads. Instead of rounded corners and soft shapes, the iPad Pro is all hard corners and flat sides, with massive, asymmetrical antenna lines on the back and a huge camera bump. Most people I showed our space gray review unit to thought it looked cool, but I think it\u2019s kind of brutal looking \u2014 almost like a reference design.\nIt is impossible to look at a device this expensive and not expect it to replace a laptop\nThose squared off edges and smaller bezels change the screen-to-body ratio in positive ways: the 11-inch model fits a larger screen in the same size body as the old 10.5-inch model, and the 12.9-inch model shrinks the body down to fit the screen, making it much less clumsy to use than the outgoing model.\nApple keeps saying the iPad Pro now has an \u201call screen design\u201d that \u201cgoes from edge to edge,\u201d but let\u2019s just be honest: nothing about these bezels is edge-to-edge. It is, however, an extremely nice 264ppi LCD screen, and I continue to be a fan of Apple\u2019s fancy technique to round off the corners of LCDs.\nApart from the corners, the new iPad Pro display is substantially the same as last year\u2019s Pro, with Apple\u2019s extremely smooth 120Hz ProMotion variable refresh rate system, True Tone automatic color calibration, and wide color support. This is one of the best, most accurate mobile displays you can look at.\nOf course, expanding the display means there\u2019s no home button or TouchID sensor. Instead, the iPad Pro has the same TrueDepth camera and Face ID system as the iPhone XS, with a 7-megapixel camera, infrared projector, and IR camera. The big change is that it now works in any orientation, so you can pick up and unlock the iPad any way you want.\nThere\u2019s a lot going on when you swipe up\nThere are some neat affordances to handle that flexibility: if you hold the iPad in landscape and cover the camera with your hand, it\u2019ll tell you, with an arrow pointing to the camera on the lock screen so you can uncover it. If you have the camera at the bottom, the lock screen will instruct you to look down so FaceI D can properly see your face. And if you have the keyboard cover on, you can double-tap the spacebar to quickly unlock with Face ID, which is very fast \u2014 and very reminiscent of Windows Hello. If only Apple put this system on its laptops, too.\nThe lack of a home button also means that you now navigate the iPad Pro using the same gestures as the iPhone: you can tap on the screen to wake, swipe up to go home, and swipe up a bit more to open the app switcher, and swipe along the bottom to switch between apps. The iPad version of iOS also has a dock, so you can swipe up just a little in an app to bring it up, which is how you slide a second app onto the screen, or quickly pop an app over your workspace to get something done.\nThese new gestures are all intuitive to pick up, especially if you\u2019ve been using a recent iPhone, but there\u2019s a lot going on when you swipe up \u2014 it definitely took me a second to figure out how to get the dock to appear instead of going home or opening up the app switcher.\nThe significant camera bump on the back houses an f/1.8 lens and a 12-megapixel sensor. Apple says this is an all-new camera that matches the performance of the old iPad Pro in a much thinner package so it can fit behind the display. You do get the benefit of Apple\u2019s Smart HDR processing, so you\u2019ll see flatter images with more detail in the shadows than before, but the images are not quite as good as the iPhone XS wide-angle camera.\nThe back of the iPad is also where you\u2019ll find the smart connector for keyboards. Apple\u2019s new Smart Keyboard case has the same keys and feel as the old model, but the folding design is all new. On the plus side, it protects both sides now, and it\u2019s much simpler and cleaner looking: that weird hump is gone, and there\u2019s no more origami folding required. But it\u2019s also less flexible: if you just want to open it up and use the iPad as a tablet, you have to flip the keyboard all the way around, where you\u2019ll feel the keys on the back. And there are only two angles when it\u2019s open, while both the Surface Pro and Google Pixel slate offer near-infinite adjustments. I\u2019d bet third parties like Logitech offer much nicer keyboard covers in the future, just like they did with the older iPad Pro.\nI gave the new Apple Pencil to Verge tech reporter Dami Lee, who is also a published cartoonist, and she thought the new magnetic charging system was a huge improvement over the clunky Lightning jack design of the previous pencil. But she was less impressed with the double-tap-to-switch-tools touch control on the side, which she found a little awkward. \u201cIt\u2019s just not as natural as having a button on the side,\u201d she said.\nWhat you will not find anywhere is a headphone jack, which is a curious omission since so many iPads are used essentially as televisions, and so many pro media workflows demand low-latency audio monitoring. Apple put AirPods in the reviewer package, so the company isn\u2019t being entirely shy about how it expects iPad Pro customers to solve this problem. (That\u2019s now a total of $2,356 for this iPad, in case you\u2019re keeping track.)\nThere are four sets of speakers \u2014 a tweeter and woofer in each corner \u2014 five microphones, and the new USB-C connector around the sides. Like everything about the new iPad Pro, that USB-C connector is both remarkably powerful and incredibly frustrating.\nWith one huge exception, most normal stuff you\u2019d plug into a USB-C port works without fuss, and a bunch of other things work if you have an app that supports it. I tried a handful of USB-C hubs with an assortment of USB-A, HDMI, card readers, and Ethernet ports, and everything worked as intended. An extremely corporate Dell USB-C hub even let me plug an external display into the iPad over VGA, which was truly a vision of the future.\nExternal displays work just like the old Lightning-to-HDMI adapter: the system will simply mirror the iPad Pro by default, but apps that support an extended screen can do different things. Keynote will use the external display as the presentation monitor and show you the next slide on the iPad, for example. Djay will show visualizers on the second screen. But most apps don\u2019t do anything except mirror, so don\u2019t get too excited about your crazy multiple-monitor iPad Pro rig just yet. All of this is exactly the same as the older iPad Pro, which supported external displays using a Lighting-to-HDMI dongle. The only real changes are that the new Pro can support up to 5K displays, and run a display simultaneously with other USB-C devices.\nKeyboards worked. A USB microphone showed up in GarageBand. You can plug a phone or Nintendo Switch into it and get up to 7.5 watts of power to charge them. (That\u2019s not really enough for a Switch, by the way.) Apple supports both analog and digital audio out, so virtually all USB-C headphones and audio dongles work, a huge improvement over the Android ecosystem.\nThis $1,899 tablet simply won\u2019t talk to a flash drive\nOther stuff didn\u2019t work, though: printers didn\u2019t do anything. A Native Instruments Maschine mk3 audio controller sat in silence. A Beyerdynamic USB-C microphone only worked when we used an A-to-C cable plugged into a hub. USB-C is still kind of messy and weird, so you\u2019ll just have to try things and see what works for you.\nBut one extremely important category of devices will definitely not work: iOS does not support external storage. You can plug as many flash drives or hard drives as you want into the iPad Pro\u2019s USB-C port, and nothing will happen. Apple says third parties can write apps to talk to external storage, but out of the box, this $1,899 tablet simply won\u2019t talk to a flash drive.\nThe one thing iOS can do with external storage devices is import photos: if you plug in a camera or a memory card from a camera, iOS 12 will automatically pop open the camera import screen and let you import photos into your camera roll.\nThat\u2019s it. That is the sole way iOS 12 can address external storage. And to make matters worse, you are required to import to the system camera roll \u2014 you can\u2019t import photos directly into an app like Lightroom CC. Apple has to be in the middle.\nI use Lightroom CC all the time, and I would love to manage and edit all my photos on an iPad Pro, especially since editing with the Apple Pencil is so much fun on this display. But I have no desire to import hundreds of RAW files into my camera roll and iCloud photos account. When I brought this up, Apple very proudly pointed to a new Siri Shortcut from Adobe that imports photos from the camera roll into Lightroom and then automatically deletes them from the camera roll.\nEither you understand iOS so well you can get around its limitations, or you give up and use a real computer\nI couldn\u2019t test that Lightroom Siri Shortcut, since it\u2019s not yet available. But I can tell you that macro-based hacks around the limitations of an operating system are not usually included in bold visions of the future of computing, and that Siri Shortcut is a pure hack around the limitations Apple has imposed on the iPad Pro.\nOh, but it gets worse. I shoot photos in JPG+RAW, and the iOS PhotoKit API only allows apps to grab one or the other from the camera roll. So I could only import my RAW images into Lightroom, leaving the JPGs behind to clutter up my camera roll and iCloud storage. That\u2019s untenable, so I just gave up and imported everything directly into Lightroom using my Mac, because my Mac doesn\u2019t insist on abstracting the filesystem away into nonsense.\nThis little Lightroom vignette is basically the story of the iPad Pro: either you have to understand the limitations of iOS so well you can make use of these little hacks all over the place to get things done, or you just deal with it and accept that you have to go back to a real computer from time to time because it\u2019s just easier. And in that case, you might as well just use a real computer.\nThese roadblocks are made all the more heartbreaking by the A12X processor, which appears to be absolutely lightning-fast. Nothing is ever slow, and it always feels like there\u2019s more headroom to work with. We have an early build of Photoshop for iPad, which is coming next year, and it handled a file with tons of layers just fine. Games were super-smooth, although no iOS games really offer Xbox One-quality graphics. We were able to import several minutes of 4K footage into Adobe Premiere Rush, edit them, and export without breaking a sweat. We were not, however, able to export that footage in 4K, because Premiere Rush is yet another disappointingly limited iPad version of an app, and only exports in 1080p.\nThere is no way to watch YouTube in 4K on the iPad Pro\nI would love to use all the power offered by the A12X, but the iPad app ecosystem is still full of cut-down apps, limited feature sets, and compromises. Yes, this new iPad Pro benchmarks faster than my daily-driver 2015 MacBook Pro, but Safari on the iPad simply isn\u2019t a desktop-class browser, so desktop websites often kick me out to mobile apps that don\u2019t have the features I need either. Microsoft Excel for iPad still doesn\u2019t support macros. If you want to write an iPad app, you have to use\u2026 a Mac.\nAnd, most irritatingly, Apple refuses to support Google\u2019s VP9 video codec, so there is literally no way to watch YouTube in 4K on the iPad Pro. You just can\u2019t do it.\nI can see any number of ways for me to get rid of my laptop and use the iPad Pro as my main computer \u2014 using an iPad is extremely pleasant, and it\u2019s nice to use a computer with a touchscreen. But over and over again, some annoying iOS limitation stopped me from making the switch. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m just stuck in some old way of thinking or that I need to spend more time inventing a new workflow out of Siri Shortcuts and glue. It\u2019s just basic stuff, like plugging in a flash drive to grab a file or quickly changing the name of a document before emailing it off.\nI don\u2019t think people should adapt to their computers. Computers should adapt to people.\nApple seems to want it both ways with the iPad Pro: it loves to tout the iPad\u2019s laptop-dwarfing sales figures and industry-leading performance, but when pushed on the iPad\u2019s limitations, the company insists that the iPad is still an ongoing attempt to build the future of computing, not a laptop replacement.\nBut after eight years, this double-sided argument is no longer tenable. Unlike virtually every other computer, the iPad is a product of Apple\u2019s singular vision: the company designs the display, the processor, the operating system, and the limits of the applications and accessories that plug into it. And after all this time, it\u2019s clear that whatever roadblocks and frustrations exist in using the iPad Pro are there because Apple wants them there. There just aren\u2019t that many excuses left.\nIt\u2019s an iPad\nLast year, when Dieter Bohn reviewed the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, he wrote that he hoped iOS 11 would make for a \u201csignificantly more powerful experience of using the iPad Pro as a computer, not just for \u2018iPad things.\u2019\u201d Well, we\u2019re on to iOS 12 and a new iPad Pro now, and I can say that we\u2019re still stuck just doing iPad things.\nIf you\u2019re the sort of person who might spend over $2,000 on a maxed-out iPad Pro, you probably know exactly why you need one, what you\u2019ll use it for, and whether it\u2019s worth it to you. You\u2019ll undoubtedly find the switch to USB-C convenient, the new Pencil to be much nicer, and the A12X to be a significant performance boost over previous iPads. You will get what you\u2019re paying for.\nBut if you\u2019re thinking about spending $799 on the cheapest 64GB 11-inch iPad Pro to replace your laptop, you should really ask yourself what you need a computer to do. There isn\u2019t a single other tablet on the market that can compete with the raw hardware of the iPad Pro, and there aren\u2019t many laptops that can either. But Apple\u2019s approach to iOS is holding that hardware back in serious and meaningful ways, and while USB-C makes life with this new iPad Pro slightly easier, it still has the same basic capabilities and limitations of last year\u2019s iPad Pro.\nIs the new iPad Pro a stunning engineering achievement? Without question. Has Apple once again produced mobile hardware that puts the rest of the industry to shame when it comes to performance, battery life, and design? Yep. Is the iPad Pro the best, most capable iPad ever made? It certainly is.\nBut you know what? It\u2019s still an iPad.",

        "title": "As rumored, iPhone XR price drops by ~$100 at Japanese carrier over two year contract",
        "body": "As rumored last week, Apple is indirectly lowering the price of the iPhone XR in Japan through larger carrier subsidies. On a 24 month contract, new customers to NTT Docomo can save about $100 over the life of their plan with the new reduced price.\nThe carrier business model in Japan relies on device subsidies to attract customers, similar to how the US smartphone market used to work. Total instalments for iPhone XR 64 GB on a 24 month contract would total 36,000 yen before this announcement. Now, the device cost drops to 24,000 yen (excluding the price of the mandatory contract fees).\nIncluding a typical contract package, iPhone XR 64 GB on NTT Docomo is now available for around 7000 yen ($62) per month. We would expect other carriers in Japan to follow suit and match the lower prices in the coming days.\nApple is believed to have authorized carriers to discount XR models more heavily due to lower-than-expected demand for the XR in the country. Apple iPhone dominates the smartphone market in Japan with about 50% of sales, but it seems demand for Apple\u2019s latest models was lukewarm.\nRather than switching to Android, Japanese customers appear to be buying iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus in large volume, which has impacted sales of the XS and XR in the region.\nDo not expect to see price cuts instated worldwide for the iPhone XR based on the changes in the Japanese market. Apple is careful to apply discounting practices selectively in specific markets, where it deems it necessary to boost sales.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

Fi will add support for Samsung, OnePlus, and iPhones, according to Droid Life, which reported on a since-removed article at BGR. More handsets from existing Fi partners LG and Motorola will also gain Fi support. The iPhone experience is apparently \u201cin beta,\u201d which is a sign that users might run into bugs or be left without some of Fi\u2019s features.\nProject Fi is the Google-backed MVNO that combines network coverage from T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular. The service is appealing for its straightforward pricing: unlimited calls and texts are $20 per month, and mobile data is $10 per gigabyte until you reach 6GB. (After that, it\u2019s free, but customers experience slower speeds if they cross 15GB.)\nThe lineup of \u201cFi-ready\u201d compatible phones \u2014 those that Google says have been fully optimized for the network \u2014 is fairly short: Google is currently selling the Pixel 3, 3 XL, 2 XL, LG G7, LG V35, Moto G6, and Moto X4 (Android One edition) directly through its Project Fi website.",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s upcoming over-ear headphones may use HomePod-style beamforming; be reversible",
        "body": "One of the key features of Apple\u2019s HomePod speaker is the beamforming technology used to adjust the sound output to the shape of the room, and using those same microphones for a neat Siri trick. By cancelling out the music output, Siri commands can be easily heard by the speaker even when it is blasting out music at full volume.\nA new Apple patent application, published today, suggests that Apple may be seeking to use the same basis of that beamforming tech in its rumored over-ear headphones, to achieve two things \u2026\nFirst, says the patent, it could make the headphones reversible. Instead of having to ensure that we\u2019re putting them on the right way round, the left earcup over the left ear, the headphones could automatically detect the orientation and adjust their output to match.\nIn one embodiment, a system for automatic right-left ear detection for a headphone comprises a first earcup and a second earcup that are identical. Each of the first and second earcups includes five microphones which are also used for purposes other than ear detection: a first microphone, a second microphone, a third microphone that is located inside each earcup facing the user\u2019s ear cavity, a fourth microphone located on a perimeter of each earcup in a triangle shape with the first and second microphones (top left, top right, and bottom middle), and a fifth microphone located above and to the left of the second microphone on a perimeter of each earcup when looking at an outside housing of each earcup. In one embodiment, when the first earcup is worn on a user\u2019s right ear the first microphone is at a location farther from a user\u2019s mouth and the second microphone is at a location closer to the user\u2019s mouth.\nIn other words, as soon as you speak, the headphones can tell which microphone is nearest to your mouth on each earcup, and from this can work out which way around the headphones are being worn. A Siri command to play music, for example, would result in stereo channels playing through the correct earcups.\nSecond, the input from an array of microphones could be used to separate speech from background noise \u2013 wind or traffic, for example \u2013 and filter out the latter on phone calls.\nA processor [\u2026] may be used to perform voice beamforming towards the user\u2019s mouth to capture the user\u2019s speech and perform noise beamforming away from the user\u2019s mouth to capture environmental noise.\nWe first heard a KGI report that Apple was working on high-end over-ear headphones back in February. This was corroborated by a Bloomberg report in July, which said they were coming next year.\nHomePod\u2019s audio quality has made me a lot more optimistic about the headphones than I would otherwise have been. We\u2019ve seen concept images and speculation about the possible name. As always with Apple patents, there\u2019s no way to tell whether the idea will ever be incorporated into a product, but this one seems a likely bet.\nVia Patently Apple\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",
