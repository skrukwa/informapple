        "title": "Apple reportedly abandoned plans to roll out end-to-end encrypted iCloud backups, apparently due to pressure from the FBI",
        "body": "According to a report from Reuters, Apple abandoned plans to release an end-to-end encrypted version of iCloud backups after facing complaints from the FBI who told Apple that it would hinder their investigations.\nThe report says that Apple was working on the feature more than two years ago, but it was cancelled after the FBI raised concerns. One employee said \u201clegal killed it, for reasons you can imagine\u201d.\nEnd-to-end encryption works by making an encryption key based on factors that are not stored on the server. This may mean entangling the key with a user password, or some cryptographic key stored on the hardware of the local iPhone or iPad. Even if someone hacked into the server and got access to the data, the data would look like random noise without having the entangled key to decode it.\nApple currently stores iCloud backups in a non end-to-end encrypted manner. This means that the decryption key is stored on Apple\u2019s servers. If a police entity comes to Apple with a subpoena, then the company has to give over all of the iCloud data \u2014 including the decryption key. This has further rounds of ramifications. For instance, whilst the iMessage service is end-to-encrypted, the conversations stored in an iCloud backup are not.\nIn the case of the widely-publicized Pensacola shooter, Apple said that it handed over gigabytes of iCloud information (likely mostly consisting of user photos) when attorney general Barr criticized the company for not doing enough to help.\nIn 2016 in fact, both The New York Times and the Financial Times said that Apple was developing more comprehensive end-to-end encryption features. No changes to iCloud Backup have been rolled out in the years since, though, and the Reuters report today suggests it is no longer on the roadmap either.\nReuters says that it is possible that other factors led to the decision to drop the initiative, such as the fear that customers would accidentally enable end-to-end backups without realizing the consequences, then forget their password and lose all access to important personal information like their photo library.\nAs shown on this webpage, Apple uses end-to-end encryption selectively. Data such as the Health database or Home configuration, iCloud Keychain and WiFi passwords is stored in an end-to-end encrypted form. However, the most personal and most sensitive categories of information like email, photos and iCloud Drive files do not offer that extra level of security, even as an option for those that would want it. Messages are also stored using end-to-encryption but as said earlier, this is nullified if the user also enabled iCloud Backup.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation has repeatedly requested that Apple and other tech companies offer end-to-end backup solutions.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "There's been a nearly 70% decline in always-on location data, since iOS 13 rollout",
        "body": "Perhaps more than GDPR or CCPA, Apple\u2019s iOS 13 privacy controls and location alerts may impact the availability of user location data \u2014 just as it\u2019s becoming a critical tool for marketers. According to research from location verification company Location Sciences, since the adoption of iOS 13 the company has seen \u201ca 68% decrease in background location data.\u201d\nDecline in background location data. Background location is \u201calways-on\u201d location collected at the device level as the user proceeds through the day and moves from place to place. Foreground location is captured only when a user has an app open.\nBackground location is generally more accurate for a range of marketing purposes than isolated data points collected while an individual is using an app. That\u2019s because always-on location regularly taps into a GPS signal to provide a moment-by-moment view of user movements vs. only a few hits throughout the day or week (or less frequently).\niOS 13 location alerts and privacy controls\nSource: Location Sciences\nThe above finding is based on an analysis of \u201ctwo billion background location events\u201d analyzed during September and October 2019 for a single UK-based app publisher. Accordingly, it\u2019s unclear how representative this data is of the broader market, but it\u2019s probably directionally accurate at a minimum. (An earlier survey-based study from Blis found that people are consciously exercising greater control over allowing their locations to be tracked.)\nDecline in data accuracy. In addition, Location Sciences says it has seen \u201ca 24% decrease in GPS data post iOS 13, nearly doubling the amount of low accuracy IP. This signals a shift in location data quality priorities in the face of privacy.\u201d\nGPS data is generally accurate to within a few meters. IP-based location, which comes from mobile phone carriers and ISPs, is much less accurate, between 1 kilometer and 20 kilometers for fixed IP address and less accurate for dynamic IP. But it\u2019s much more widely available.\nDecline in supply of available background location\nSource: Location Sciences\nLocation Sciences infers in its report that \u201cThe decrease in background location data vs. that of foreground location data suggests that consumers are more averse to sharing data when they are not using the app or receiving location-specific value in exchange for shared data.\u201d As a general proposition, the majority of mobile users are now aware of location tracking. Consumers have indicated in numerous surveys that they\u2019re typically willing to share location when they understand the benefits of doing so or are rewarded in some way.\nWhy we care. If background and high-quality location data become less available over time, according to Location Sciences, this will \u201cripple through media delivery, personalized ad experience, audience segmentation and most importantly location analytics.\u201d The company says that high-quality location data (or marketing supported by it) will likely cost more in the future.\nMarketers will need to better understand location data sources and perhaps consider using a third party to audit location data. For developers and publishers, enticing users to share location \u2014 except for things like maps \u2014 will require a better user experience or improved incentives.\nOpinions expressed in this article are those of the guest author and not necessarily MarTech.

        "title": "App tracking alert in iOS 13 has dramatically cut location data flow to ad industry - Apple's initiatives to minimize tracking by marketers is continuing to make life harder for the advertising industry, forcing advertisers to use inefficient data sources to pinpoint users.",
        "body": "Article Hero Image\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nApple's initiatives to minimize tracking by marketers is continuing to make life harder for the advertising industry, forcing advertisers to use inefficient data sources to pinpoint users.\nOver the years, Apple has enhanced how it protects the privacy of its users online, typically by limiting what data can be seen by advertisers tracking different data points. Initiatives such as Intelligent Tracking Protection in Safari has helped secure more privacy by making it harder to track individual users, which advertising executives in December admitted has been \"stunningly effective.\"\nWhile ITP and other improvements have helped to minimize the tracking of users, marketers are also being affected by another element of iOS 13, one where users are regularly notified of apps that are capturing their location in the background. The warning gives options for users to allow an app to continue to track all the time or to do so when it is open, with users often selecting the latter.\nAccording to data from location-verification firm Location Sciences seen by DigiDay, approximately seven in ten iPhone users analyzed by the company downloaded iOS 13 in its first six weeks of availability. Of those users who installed the update, around 80% of them stopped all background tracking by apps.\nAd tracking company Teemo suggests the opt-in rates to share data with apps when not in use are often below 50%, whereas three years ago, the same rates were close to 100%. The higher rates were due to it being a time when users were largely unaware there were options to disable tracking in the first place.\n\"People have decided to stop their phones' sharing location data at a universal level,\" Location Sciences chief business officer Jason Smith admitted.\nThe trend of disabling tracking makes it harder for firms to rate the effectiveness of campaigns, Starcom managing partner Paul Kasamias suggests. The change impacts \"the ability to tie users that research online and purchase in store,\" as well as making measuring footfall in stores a \"far more opaque\" process for clients.\nA drop in advertiser spending is likely to occur from small or medium-sized advertisers, Kasamias believes, as they are clients \"where cost efficiency is paramount and there is a physical footprint, as targeting the right user at the right time will become more difficult.\"\nThe change has already led to a reduction in \"sales pitches from providers of location-data solutions,\" Havas Media EVP Sargi Mann claimed, with there being more of a need to address the location issue \"transparently up front as part of bigger deals\" with marketers.\nDespite the reduced amount of location data available, the amount that is still available to use is more valuable, while the market for location data continues to thrive.\n\"We're still being approached by location data businesses that are telling us they're growing, said Rippll CEO Doug Chisholm. \"More importantly, they have more data than they did a year ago.\"\nThe quality of that data is still a problem, as ad buyers notice it is of a lower quality than data that was previously available. According to Smith, Location Sciences is seeing less location data derived from a smartphone's GPS, \"which is the most precise source of mobile location data.\"\nInstead, Smith highlights the presence of \"lower quality data\" sourced from carriers or other Internet protocols. \"Often the least accurate sources of mobile location data available\" to a marketer in his opinion.",

        "body": "Samsung just can\u2019t help itself: during a CES keynote yesterday, its executives brought up a slide to explain Samsung Pass which had what looks to be Apple\u2019s Face ID icon on it.\nSamsung Pass is the company\u2019s new biometric identity management as-a-service product.\niMore first spotted the logo which appears to have been borrowed from the Face ID glyph. It should be noted that Apple has registered the Face ID logo in multiple countries around the world so it will be interesting seeing whether it will send its legal sharks after Samsung.\nKeep in mind that it\u2019s entirely possible that Samsung Pass is coming to the iPhone, in which case users may be able to authenticate using Face ID. And if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here, then Apple probably gave Samsung permission to use its Face ID logo.\nSamsung previously also \u201cborrowed\u201d Apple\u2019s Touch ID logo.\nAnother possibility: Samsung being Samsung. And with that scenario in mind, what are the options that Apple\u2019s legal team has to protect its intellectual property?\nCult of Mac explains:\n\u2018In terms of copyright, the threshold for protection for user interface metaphors\u2014such as using a trashcan to signify deletion\u2014is quite high,\u2019 Anna Ronkainen, an intellectual property scholar at the University of Helsinki, told Cult of Mac. If Apple chooses to defend its trademark in this latest instance, Ronkainen thinks Samsung could make an argument about the transparent nature of the icon. That means arguing that the average consumer will associate the icon with generic biometric login via facial recognition. Samsung could argue that the trademark should never have been granted in the first place. If that\u2019s the case, Ronkainen said, \u2018off to the courts we go.\u2019 Literally. \u2018The outcome is impossible to predict at this point.\u2019 Impossible, that is, other than the high probability that it would involve years more Apple vs. Samsung battling in court.\nResembling the original smiley face Macintosh logo from the 1980s, the Face ID glyph was first used by Apple with the iPhone X that released in 2017.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMYvs5PhwXg\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Samsung has slavishly copied work by its rivals. In fact, the South Korean firm is regularly accused by its competitors of stealing their industrial designs and ideas. Samsung was famously sued by Apple for copying the iPhone look and feel.\nIt was eventually confirmed by courts that Samsung did lift Apple\u2019s copyrighted work wholesale. As a result, the Galaxy maker is now on the hook for millions of dollars in damages.\nWhat\u2019s your opinion?

        "title": "Report: The FBI recently unlocked an iPhone 11 Pro with GrayKey, raising more doubts about the Pensacola case",
        "body": "As Apple stands firm against requests to break iPhone encryption, many people have questioned why the FBI needs Apple\u2019s help in the first place. There are plenty of tools available from third-party companies that are more than capable of unlocking the iPhone 5 and iPhone 7 used by the Pensacola gunman.\nFurther emphasizing that point, a new report from Forbes says that the FBI recently used one of those black/gray market tools to unlock the newest \u2014 and theoretically the most secure \u2014 iPhone that Apple sells.\nAccording to the report, FBI investigators in Ohio used the GrayKey hardware box to unlock an iPhone 11 Pro Max. The phone in question belonged to Baris Ali Koch, who was being accused of helping his convicted brother escape the country by letting him use his passport.\nKoch\u2019s lawyer confirmed to Forbes that the iPhone in question was locked with a passcode, and that Koch had never given up that passcode, nor is it possible that Face ID could have been used. This corroborates Forbes\u2019 claim that GrayKey was used.\nThe \u201cGrayKey\u201d is a hardware box sold by forensics firm Grayshift that has long been used by law enforcement and investigators to gain access to locked iPhones. Details about the GrayKey are usually kept under wraps, including whether it works on Apple\u2019s newest operating systems and iPhones. This is generally to make it harder for Apple to patch the vulnerabilities Grayshift uses.\nThe two iPhones used by the Pensacola shooter were an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 7. As we\u2019ve said before, the FBI can easily unlock these devices using third-party solutions. In fact, the FBI could likely use the same exploit it used to unlock the iPhone 5C used by the San Bernardino shooter in 2015.\nSo why are the FBI, Donald Trump, Attorney General William Barr, and others all calling on Apple itself to break iPhone encryption? The most obvious possibility is that it\u2019s a political move, designed to help push through legislation that would require Apple and other tech companies to include backdoors in all hardware and software.\nThere\u2019s also the money argument. If Apple was required to build backdoors into iOS and the iPhone, the FBI would no longer have to pay firms like Grayshift and Cellebrite.\nWhat do you think? Why is the FBI taking a public stance against Apple, when it seemingly knows and has even used tools capable of unlocking the iPhones?

        "title": "iPhone 11 Series Was a Smashing Hit During U.S. Holiday Season; $699 Model Made up 39 Percent of Total Sales",
        "body": "New data published by CIRP reveals that Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 series comprising of the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max are a major hit in the U.S. For some, the term \u2018major hit\u2019 might be a bit of an understatement because all models launched last year have accounted for 69 percent of total iPhone sales. If that didn\u2019t impress you, the $699 model, which is the iPhone 11, accounted for 39 percent of all iPhone sales. Looks like Tim Cook was right all along when he stated during Apple\u2019s fourth quarter earnings that the iPhone 11 is off to a tremendous start.\nApple\u2019s 2018 iPhone XR Continues to Do Well During the Holiday Season, Thanks to Its $599 Starting Price\nApple hasn\u2019t released official unit figures, meaning that these estimates have been taken from analyst\u2019s surveys. So far, the information appears to be convincing, as the iPhone 11 is the most popular model between October and December 2019. It appears that Apple\u2019s strategy of further cutting the starting price of its entry-level, yet highly capable model has paid off wonders.\nThe iPhone XR, which has reported to be the most popular smartphone in the world for 2019, continues to sell well. Its high-end features coupled with it\u2019s $599 starting price are no doubt the deciding factors for its success. However, between 2018 and 2019, CIRP reports that the average selling price or ASP fell from $839 in December 2018 to about $809.\nThis decline was expected as the iPhone 11 launched at a price that\u2019s $50 cheaper than the cheapest model launched back in 2018. That was the iPhone XR, which was unveiled for $749 during Apple\u2019s 2018 keynote. CIRP also notes that the base storage models ended up being the most popular.\nA majority of customers of the iPhone 11 and older models picked up the 64GB variants, while two-thirds of iPhone 11 Pro customers picked up a 256GB or 512GB version. Since Apple will announce its quarterly earnings on January 28, we\u2019ll know just how well the company did after the iPhone 11\u2019s inception. Hopefully, it will be positive news for the technology giant.\nYou might also like to check out:\nNews Source: 9to5Mac",

        "title": "Two iPhones or the privacy of billions: Why Apple vs. the FBI matters",
        "body": "Two iPhones have put Apple back into the FBI\u2019s sights.\nThe phones belonged to a deceased Saudi national accused of fatally shooting three people at a Florida naval base in December. They could contain important information about his connections and motivation, but the phones are locked and the FBI says it can\u2019t get in. It wants Apple\u2019s help to unlock the phones.\nBut Apple is saying no, and it has its reasons, even at the risk of attracting mocking tweets from President Donald Trump.\nApple and technology security experts have heard this kind of request before. And they say it\u2019s not about the phones \u2014 it\u2019s about a yearslong push by the Department of Justice for broader government oversight of mobile technology. If Apple says yes to this request or anything like it, they say, it would jeopardize the privacy of every single iPhone user.\nAlmost four years after a nearly identical situation ended with the FBI backing down \u2014 when private companies helped them crack the iPhone's security \u2014 the debate about whether Apple should create a way to break into their own phones is back.\nThe circumstances, however, have changed. Apple has limited its own capability to break the encryption of iPhones, so it may not be able to do much even if it were willing to, while Facebook and other tech companies have moved to embrace encryption in other forms such as messaging apps, raising the stakes of the fight.\nAnd politically, the tech industry may be vulnerable in a way that it\u2019s never been before.\n\u201cThere\u2019s blood in the water,\u201d said Riana Pfefferkorn, associate director of surveillance and cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. \u201cAnd this becomes a way for law enforcement to try to draw attention to encryption.\u201d\nWhile the core argument remains the same \u2014 there\u2019s no way to give the government access without introducing an opening that can be exploited by nefarious actors \u2014 it\u2019s taking place at a time when tech companies are now routinely grilled on Capitol Hill and the public is less likely to trust that they know best.\nTech industry veterans and academics believe the Justice Department sees an opportunity to not just crack a couple iPhones but also to capitalize on growing skepticism of tech companies to spur legislative change that will render encryption moot in all contexts.\nNicholas Weaver, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, said that the FBI\u2019s efforts to push Apple to crack its own iPhones were \u201cmore disingenuous than normal.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely about legislation, not the courts,\u201d he said.\nAt issue are two iPhones owned by the gunman who carried out a shooting last month that killed three people at the Naval Air Station Pensacola, in Florida. There are some parallels with the FBI efforts four years ago to get Apple to unlock an iPhone from the San Bernardino shooting that killed 14 people \u2014 a dispute that ended with the government breaking the phone\u2019s security with the help of an outside vendor.\nIn the Pensacola case, the phones have been described as earlier model iPhones 5 and 7, which many technology experts say the FBI should also be able to unlock with the help of outside security vendors.\nSo if the FBI can break into the phones, why is Attorney General William Barr formally asking Apple to provide the key? The answer appears to lie in the legal history of the matter, and the government\u2019s desire for a permanent solution.\nIn the time since the San Bernardino dispute, government officials have been dealt two major setbacks in court: a 2016 ruling in an unrelated but similar case in Brooklyn, New York, siding with Apple and never appealed, and a 2018 ruling out of Fresno, California, though the details of that case and ruling are sealed and the case is on appeal.\nThat\u2019s left the Justice Department with narrower legal options to push tech companies to crack their own security systems.\n\u201cThey have recognized that the law as it stands is not on the government\u2019s side,\u201d Pfefferkorn said.\nThere is not consensus in the government that the Justice Department is pursuing the right course of action. While President Donald Trump tweeted for Apple to give in to the FBI, other agencies have disagreed with the Justice Department and the FBI, and the Trump administration hasn\u2019t released a consensus policy document.\nMorgan Reed, president of The App Association, a trade group for software companies that says it has more than 5,000 members, met on Thursday with staff from the White House National Economic Council and the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\nHe said that despite the president\u2019s tweets, the two offices are concerned that the FBI\u2019s efforts could hurt U.S. companies.\n\u201cThey want to solve the problem, as well, but they want to solve the problem in a manner that protects the economic security of the United States,\u201d he said.\nReed also said the Justice Department's efforts were more to spur legislative change than to gain access to any particular iPhone.\n\u201cThey\u2019re using this crisis to essentially drive for a policy change that ultimately would require some potentially devastating technological changes that would put people\u2019s personal information at risk,\u201d he said.\nThe White House had no immediate comment Friday. Representatives for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cIt is very important to know with whom and about what the shooter was communicating before he died,\u201d Barr said Monday.\nNo such split exists in the broader technology industry. Tech companies and privacy advocates who are often at odds on most topics remain united in their opposition of the FBI\u2019s efforts.\nBut the tech industry does face shifting social and political dynamics that have put it on the back foot. A Pew Research Center survey from June 2019 found that the percentage of both Republican and Democratic supporters who see tech as having a positive impact has dropped sharply in recent years, and a survey by Axios and SurveyMonkey found growing support for greater regulation of tech companies. Democratic presidential candidates now include tech policy ideas as part of their platforms.\nGovernment efforts to limit or compromise encryption have also gained traction outside the U.S., drawing more coordinated efforts in the tech industry. In December, a coalition of 102 organizations and individuals sent a letter to senior officials in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Australia warning that compromising encryption would hurt the privacy and security of billions. The three countries had earlier sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking him to delay plans to expand end-to-end encrypted messaging.\nThe FBI has likewise been grilled on its own credibility. An inspector general report from 2018 said that the FBI headed to court against Apple in the San Bernardino dispute without first exhausting its technical options. And the FBI acknowledged to The Washington Post that it had repeatedly inflated the number of devices it couldn\u2019t access.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any actual data proving this is a serious problem,\u201d said Andi Wilson Thompson, a senior policy analyst at New America\u2019s Open Technology Institute.\nFor now, technologists and lobbyists see something of a stalemate, with no pending legislation or compromise gaining traction. Previous efforts to pass legislation around encryption and government access have fallen flat, with a 2016 bipartisan encryption bill roasted by critics as \u201ctechnically illiterate.\u201d\nAnd with much of Washington focused on the ongoing impeachment trial, Pfefferkorn said she is not too worried in the near term.\n\u201cCongress seems to be a little busy right now,\u201d she said.",

Its gesture-based system sets it apart from the official Reddit app for iOS.\nWith today\u2019s update, Apollo for Reddit has added support for searching in comments. This feature is currently available to Apollo Pro users, but it will be available to all users in March. There\u2019s also now support for searching saved items.\nJust like on desktop Reddit you can now search through a comments thread for keywords and jump directly to them, it\u2019s so handy for seeing if something specific was mentioned, or finding a user, or a mirror for a video.\nApollo for Reddit also now supports GIF sounds. GIFs that have audio are becoming increasingly popular, and this update means you can now take part in the fun with Apollo. Here are the details on new filtering:\nA few parts to this. The first is now for people who like to filter a lot of things, you can now filter more than 100 subreddits from r/All and r/Popular. Reddit has an account limitation that limits it to 100 (which was why you couldn\u2019t before) but now for Pro users once you hit 100 it\u2019ll store them locally on your phone and handle it from there. The other element is that it\u2019s a lot easier to add filters now, you can filter subreddits directly from the post/subreddit and you can block users directly from their profile, no more needing to manually type it in.\nVersion 1.7 of Apollo for Reddit includes quite a few other changes as well. There are new photo uploading and saving features, new sorting options for threads, the ability to mute and unmute comment threads, and much more. From a design standpoint, there are also new custom icons available with today\u2019s update.\nThe full release notes can be viewed in the announcement post on Reddit.\nThe Apollo for Reddit update is rolling out now on the App Store. The app is a free download with in-app purchases.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Future iPhones may act as emergency beacons even without cell service",
        "body": "Future iPhones may switch off the screen to save power and broadcast an emergency signal\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nA new patent describes multiple ways in which an iPhone could use cell signals, wi-fi or even other nearby devices to get an emergency distress beacon out, plus ways of prolonging the battery until rescue arrives.\nExisting iPhones are able to alert the authorities on command, but Apple is planning new ways to help users in areas where regular cellphone coverage is either unavailable or problematic. A new Emergency Power Save Mode (EPSM) will be able to broadcast a distress signal in multiple different ways while also minimizing battery use in order to keep the device working until the user is rescued.\n\"Mobile electronic devices may take the form of smart phones or tablets that a user typically carries,\" begins Apple in US Patent No 20200015169, \"Enhanced Emergency Beacon Sending Procedure\".\n\"These and other devices may be carried by users in remote locations and a user may desire to broadcast an emergency beacon in a location that is not covered by cellular service,\" it continues.\nApple intends its procedures to become as much of a universal standard as possible, to the extent that the patent describes it being implemented on devices from PlayStation Portable to smart glasses and Android phones. Apple refers to all of these devices as User Equipment (UE).\n\"[The] UE may be configured to broadcast an emergency beacon in response to user input,\" says the patent. \"For example, a user may become lost or injured while hiking and may use an emergency beacon broadcast feature to notify other users or base stations in the area... and as described in greater detail below, the emergency beacon broadcast feature may operate as an off-grid radio service (OGRS) when the UE does not have an active connection to a base station or other wireless access point.\"\nThere are broadly two elements to the procedure in the patent, starting with power saving.\n\"If a user of a UE is in a dire situation or another situation that would benefit from emergency beacon broadcasting or beacon broadcasting in general, a significant amount of time may pass before a broadcast emergency beacon is successfully received by another user or a base station and help is mobilized to assist the user,\" it says.\n\"For example, a user in a remote rural location may not be within a communicatively effective distance from other UEs or base stations capable of receiving the emergency beacon. As such, it may be desirable for the UE to be able to broadcast emergency beacons over an extended period of time, to increase the likelihood of a successful reception of the broadcast,\" it continues.\nDetail from the patent showing that the screen is the first thing to be switched off in order to save power in emergencies\nSince such a user is unlikely to have access to power to recharge the battery, Apple says the power level \"may potentially reduce the chance that the emergency beacon is successfully broadcast and received before the battery is drained.\"\nUnder Apple's proposed system, a user could elect to manually turn on the Emergency Power Save Mode. Or could choose beforehand to have it be automatically turned on when the battery falls below a specified amount.\nIn either case, once enabled, the EPSM would switch off the display, one of the biggest drains on battery life. The patent details the different power demands of the display, backlighting and \"various other processes... over Wi-Fi and... GPS.\"\n\"[EPSM will] preserve battery while enabling emergency beacon broadcasting through efficient handling of the display of the device and radio frequency (RF) signaling.\"\nThe second part of the procedure involves how the emergency signal is broadcast. That includes attempting to locate and use a nearby cell service or local wi-fi network.\n\"[Alternatively,] emergency beacon may be an off-grid radio service (OGRS) device-to-device (D2D) communication. For example, the UE may broadcast an emergency beacon according to existing D2D communication protocols,\" says the patent. \"The emergency beacon may be receivable by other UEs and/or by base stations.\"",

        "body": "On January 24, 1984, former Apple CEO Steve Jobs introduced the first Macintosh at Apple's annual shareholder's meeting in Cupertino, California, debuting the new computer equipped with a 9-inch black and white display, an 8MHz Motorola 68000 processor, 128KB of RAM, a 3.5-inch floppy drive, and a price tag of $2,495.\nThe now iconic machine weighed in at a whopping 17 pounds and was advertised as offering a word processing program, a graphics package, and a mouse. At the time it was introduced, the Macintosh was seen as Apple's last chance to overcome IBM's domination of the personal computer market and remain a major player in the personal computer industry.\nComputerland newspaper ad from the day the Macintosh was introduced\nJobs pulled the Macintosh out of a bag at the event, powered it on, and the Mac had a little message for everyone in attendance.\nHello, I'm Macintosh. It sure is great to get out of that bag. Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, I'd like to share with you a maxim I thought of the first time I met an IBM mainframe: NEVER TRUST A COMPUTER YOU CAN'T LIFT! Obviously, I can talk, but right now I'd like to sit back and listen. So, it is with considerable pride that I introduce a man who's been like a father to me... STEVE JOBS.\nDespite the high price at the time, which was equivalent to around $6,000 today, the Macintosh sold well, with Apple hitting 70,000 units sold by May 1984. The now iconic \"1984\" Super Bowl ad that Apple invested in and debuted days before the Macintosh was unveiled may have helped bolster sales.\nAfter the Macintosh, Apple introduced the Macintosh II, the Macintosh Classic, the PowerBook, the Power Macintosh, the iMac G3, the iBook, and so on, eventually leading to the current Mac lineup, which includes the MacBook Air , MacBook Pro, \u200ciMac\u200c, \u200ciMac\u200c Pro, Mac mini , and Mac Pro\nToday, Apple is one of the leading PC vendors in the world, shipping an estimated 18 million Macs worldwide in 2019. Then Apple competitor IBM is no longer in the personal computer business, having sold its technology to Lenovo back in the early 2000s.\nApple in the future is expected to continue expanding its popular Mac lineup, and current rumors suggest we can expect to see new 16-inch MacBook Pro models, a refreshed 13-inch machine with scissor keyboard, and, eventually, an ARM-based Mac.",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s iPad changed the tablet game 10 years ago today.",
        "body": "Steve Jobs stepped onstage 10 years ago today to introduce the world to the iPad. It was, by his own admission, a third category of device that sits somewhere between a smartphone and a laptop. Jobs unveiled the iPad just days after the annual Consumer Electronics Show ended in Las Vegas and at a time when netbooks were dominating personal computing sales.\n\u201cThey\u2019re slow, they have low quality displays, and they run clunky old PC software,\u201d said Jobs, mocking the PC industry\u2019s obsession with netbooks. \u201cThey\u2019re not better than a laptop at anything, they\u2019re just cheap laptops.\u201d\nApple had an answer to the netbook: a 9.7-inch tablet that allowed you to hold the internet in your hands. Central to the iPad and Jobs\u2019 marketing pitch was the ability to have a full browser that you could manipulate with your fingers. Apple\u2019s iPhone had been pushing the boundaries of the mobile web at the time, but Jobs boasted that the iPad was \u201cthe best browsing experience you\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\nApple was also looking to create a third category of device that was better at certain tasks than a laptop or smartphone. The iPad was designed to be better at web browsing, email, photos, video, music, games, and ebooks. \u201cIf there\u2019s going to be a third category of device it\u2019s going to have to be better at these kinds of tasks than a laptop or a smartphone, otherwise it has no reason for being,\u201d said Jobs.\nRumors about the iPad had been persistent in the build-up to Apple\u2019s press event in January 2010. CES attendees were anticipating some type of slate device, and Microsoft employees who I spoke to at the time laughed off the rumors. Microsoft had just launched Windows 7, and it had some minor improvements to touch capabilities.\nSteve Ballmer, Microsoft\u2019s CEO in 2010, used his keynote at CES to demonstrate \u201cslate PCs\u201d from manufacturers like Pegatron, Archos, and HP. These devices were running the \u201cclunky old PC software,\u201d that Jobs mocked days later, and Ballmer struggled to navigate the HP Slate device to demonstrate Kindle software and video playback. It was just Windows 7 squeezed onto a new form factor, with very little changes. Microsoft had originally attempted to launch the idea of tablet PCs back in 2001, with a Windows XP Tablet PC Edition derivative, and even special ultra-mobile PCs in 2006 \u2014 but both initiatives flopped.\nApple\u2019s iPad presented something new a decade ago, something that looked like a significant challenge to netbooks, laptops, and even Windows itself. The idea of a third category of devices, namely tablets, was difficult for many to process at the time. The iPad was widely mocked for its name in the days after the announcement, and some analysts had already predicted it would flop before it was even announced. Wired labeled it \u201clittle more than a giant iPhone,\u201d and there were predictions that it wouldn\u2019t be a significant product line for Apple.\nApple went on to sell 300,000 iPads on the first day of sales, and it broke 2 million sales less than two months later. After selling 7.5 million iPads in 2010, Apple sold 32.4 million iPads in 2011, 58.3 million in 2012, and 71 million in 2013. The naysayers were proven wrong almost immediately, and Apple has sold well over 350 million iPads to date, even though sales peaked in 2013.\nResponses to the iPad have been varied since its 2010 introduction. Microsoft pivoted hard to a touch-friendly user interface in Windows 8 for its launch in October 2012, and the company even launched its own line of Surface tablets that were designed to compete with the iPad. PC makers rushed to create a range of different tablet and laptop hybrids, but Microsoft went too far with Windows 8 and walked a lot of its touch-friendly changes back with subsequent updates and the launch of Windows 10.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Surface RT tablet.\nAndroid OEMs have also tried to compete with the iPad with varying degrees of success. Samsung launched its Galaxy Note series of tablets and smartphones nearly two years after the iPad\u2019s introduction, and the smaller phone-like versions have certainly proved more memorable than the larger tablets.\nAmazon also launched a range of Fire tablets, which have become Apple\u2019s closest competitor in the tablet space simply due to their low prices. Android has struggled to adapt to larger screen sizes, and app developers haven\u2019t fully embraced tablet apps on Android.\nThe success of the Galaxy Note and Apple\u2019s experiments with the iPad Mini have all left the market open for Android to really succeed with larger phones rather than tablets. This has meant that, even today, there\u2019s still no clear competitor to the iPad. Amazon, Samsung, Microsoft, and others have simply carved out a different part of the overall tablet market to offer something different to the iPad.\nApple has also adapted along the way. While the iPad launched as a pure tablet device 10 years ago, it looks a lot more like it wants to be a Surface in 2020. All of Apple\u2019s bigger iPad devices now support a keyboard and stylus input. Those have been key to the Windows tablet market for years, and Apple has also been adapting its iPadOS so the operating system and hardware is capable of more laptop-like tasks.\nThe iPad has long been an in-between device as Apple intended, and it has largely achieved its goals of being good for the consumption tasks that Steve Jobs laid out. It never killed netbooks, though, as they merely adapted and morphed into touchscreen laptops. Intel\u2019s big Ultrabook push helped here, and the technology has trickled down to the point where every Windows laptop ships with a touchscreen now, even at very low price points.",

It gets 4 stars due to a few simple things that should be changed. The main one is that the 2x power ups should be stackable, as I find almost no reason to save them after another one shows up on the board. The second thing is that the 2x power ups should be more consistent. Sometimes I\u2019ll be playing and they will show up twice in a short period of time when i don\u2019t even need them, and then other times I will have gone through 30-40 before finding them. This brings me to my last point, which is the predictably. After playing this game for about a month at least 2 hours a day, I can name exactly when the big waves of blocks come. There are ones ~ 30,50,68,88,114,135,150,180. I don\u2019t think i should be able to say that. One more thing, there is this feature where two blocks that are next to each other can be hit at the same time. I\u2019ve tried mastering the skill of consistently hitting them, but it is always a gamble. I can\u2019t tell if this is a bug or a feature, but IMO it either needs to be turned off or given a larger margin of error so it can be used as a real strategy instead of a gamble.",

        "body": "\u201cI totally forgot that Rihanna was used as the track for an iPad 2 guided tour. What a weird year.\u201d Sam Henri Gold was giving me a progress update on what would eventually become The Apple Archive. He had just made it to 2011. Compiled from hundreds of videos and images spanning Apple\u2019s near 44-year history, the collection is believed to be one of the largest of its kind ever made available. It launches today.\nLike Sam, I had no recollection of Rihanna\u2019s introduction to the iTunes Store app on iPad 2. I wasn\u2019t aware of the Apple Store demo loops for the Power Mac G4, either. But I am fond of the \u201cSolar\u201d spot that launched the first aluminum iMacs and helped spark my lifelong interest in Apple. And I could never forget the \u201cNext Level Fun\u201d ad for the third-generation iPod touch that I watched frame by frame and attempted to recreate in my basement as a teen with more time than resources.\nThat\u2019s what The Apple Archive is all about. Sam hopes the collection he\u2019s compiled will inspire the next generation of designers, developers, and Apple fans by preserving the company\u2019s legacy of creativity. His first Apple product was a 2005 iPod nano, gifted to him on his fourth birthday. The rest, you might say, is history.\nApple online store launch press images, 1997\n\u201cThe whole project began for me when the EveryAppleAds YouTube channel was taken down in April 2017,\u201d Sam says. \u201cI was away in Massachusetts at the time, so I just started by going on YouTube and typing in \u201capple commercial 1976,\u201d downloading whatever I could, and stuffing the videos in an iCloud Drive folder. I only had a hundred or so videos when I started up a YouTube channel. I think it remained up for a whopping six days before my channel was abruptly removed without a trace. Had it remained up on YouTube, I think I would\u2019ve neglected the archive a lot more than I have.\u201d\nIn June 2019, Sam opened up an early version of his archive as a public Google Drive folder. But the project didn\u2019t last. Traffic quotas and security vulnerabilities sunk the ship. A promising collaboration with The Internet Archive fell through when Sam needed to find a way to stop people from bulk downloading the entire collection. Now he\u2019s landed on a solution that works. Vimeo provides a locked-down player to deter downloads and significantly less video compression than YouTube. The Apple Archive has never been about piracy. Its mission is preservation.\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/375316032\n\u201cGamma\u201d (1080p), 2008\nFinding content for the archive hasn\u2019t been easy. YouTube is littered with unorganized duplicates and low-res uploads that have been distorted through an online game of telephone. Many of the clips and images were virtually lost to time until being resurfaced over the past year (have you ever seen the 2000 \u201cSnowglobe\u201d ad for the iMac G3?) Sam says these unreleased odds and ends are some of his favorite parts. \u201cWhile I\u2019m not willing to share how I\u2019ve obtained them in order to protect my sources, they\u2019ve been very accommodating to this very charming young man and his passion project,\u201d he adds.\nNow that The Apple Archive has a permanent home, complete with appropriately-styled title cards for each year in Apple\u2019s timeline, Sam is undertaking several projects to expand and streamline the collection. Videos are being transcoded to save space and subtitles added for accessibility where Apple has already created .vtt files.\niPhone 4s print ads, 2011\nThe full collection spans over 15,000 files and just under 1TB of data. PDFs, print ads, WWDC sessions, obscure clips from the \u201880s, and an unabridged collection of macOS and iOS wallpapers are among the additions still on the way. New content will be announced on Twitter.\nMaintaining a project this large is costly in both time and resources, so Sam welcomes monetary donations to keep the archive running. Content donations are also appreciated. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for nice, higher resolution copies of anything. I\u2019m even open to accepting physical media,\u201d he adds. That invitation extends to creatives who\u2019ve worked with Apple and may wish to anonymously donate material.\nSam knows his efforts could be rendered useless with one word from Apple. But he hopes the amicable and educational nature of the archive will keep it online, because the Apple community deserves no less.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen what a world without a public archive would look like, a world littered with tiny archive channels, maybe one or two god-awful screen recordings of keynotes with giant *UNREGISTERED HYPERCAM 2* watermarks. That\u2019s not a world I want to live in. That\u2019s not a world anyone should have to live in. When I got my nana\u2019s 2006 iMac, I bought iWork solely to recreate Macworld keynotes I had watched on YouTube, right down to the slide transition. I don\u2019t know if there are still kids that do that, but I hope this project and the past three years of file management hell I\u2019ve put myself in will help that kid with their Stevenote re-creation.\u201d\nYou can take a trip down memory lane and browse The Apple Archive here.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

I was under the impression that there will be a cost even with AppleCare+.\n\u200cAirPods Pro\u200c owners with \u200cAppleCare\u200c+ who want to order replacement tips can do so by going to the Apple support site, choosing the \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c, picking the option to replace an AirPod or an ear tip, selecting the option to replace the \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c ear tips, and then choosing the order replacement option.\nWhen ordering replacement tips, Apple sends one pair in a specified size only, and it's not clear if there's a limit on the number of free replacement tips that can be ordered.\nApple's support site and the \u200cAppleCare\u200c+ page for headphones don't mention the possibility of free replacement tips, instead suggesting the tips will have a $3.95 replacement fee. Ordering AirPods tips without \u200cAppleCare\u200c+ incurs the aforementioned $3.95 fee.",

        "body": "At least one iPhone 12 model will come in a new Navy Blue finish, according to XDA Developers writer and leaker Max Weinbach, who shared his information with YouTube channel EverythingApplePro.\nWeinbach believes that Navy Blue could replace the Midnight Green finish available for iPhone 11 Pro models. In line with this, EverythingApplePro created a mockup of what the iPhone 12 Pro in Navy Blue could look like.\niPhone 12 Pro in Navy Blue concept via EverythingApplePro/Max Weinbach\nWeinbach has accurately revealed a new iPhone color in the past. In May 2019, through his Twitter account PineLeaks, he said the successor to the iPhone XR would come in a new light green color. However, he said the green option would replace yellow, and the iPhone 11 is available in both green and yellow.\nWeinbach also accurately predicted that the volume HUD would become less obtrusive in iOS 13, but he has also shared several Apple-related rumors that did not pan out, including the iPad getting a native Calculator app in iOS 13 and the HomePod launching in Austria and Italy within 2019.\nThe iPhone XR successor will come without the yellow color we saw last year, but with a new light green color.\nThe shade of this green is comparable with the blue we currently have. It will be a quite bright color, but not too flashy. \u2014 Pine (@PineLeaks) May 10, 2019 So just got some amazing news... In iOS 13 the volume HUD is gone! Apple is finally fixing their software!\nIt's also supposed to be ground breaking but whatever. \u2014 Max Weinbach (@MaxWinebach) February 19, 2019\nWeinbach has a more established track record with Android-related rumors, most recently including alleged Samsung Galaxy S20 leaks\nWatch this EverythingApplePro video for a closer look at the Navy Blue concept:\nApple plans to release five new iPhone models in 2020 , including the so-called \"iPhone 9\" or \"iPhone SE 2\" with a 4.7-inch display in the spring and a higher-end, OLED-and-5G lineup with one 5.4-inch model, two 6.1-inch models, and one 6.7-inch model in the fall, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.",

        "body": "Apple in December began testing an expansion of its more detailed Apple Maps app in the Central and Southeastern parts of the United States, along with Alaska, and that updated Maps content is now rolling out to all customers.\nThe revamped Maps app features more extensive geographical details, with updated buildings, roads, parks, sports fields, parking lots, foliage, pools, pedestrian pathways, and bodies of water.\nTo get its mapping data, Apple uses its own vehicles equipped with LIDAR sensors and cameras. Apple has been using this method to collect mapping information for years now.\nApple began rolling out its updated mapping app to customers starting in iOS 12, and at the 2019 Worldwide Developer Conference, Apple said all customers in the United States would receive the improved Maps app by the end of the year.\nApple has made good on that promise with the rollout of the new mapping terrain to large swathes of the United States, and the updated Maps are now becoming available across most of the country. It could still take some time for all users in the Central and Southeastern areas of the U.S. to see the new content. Apple plans to bring the new Maps app to additional countries in 2020.\n(Thanks, @tricil and @NateThompson!)\nUpdate: Though Apple has begun releasing the new mapping updates across the United States, updated Maps features are not yet showing up for all users in the Southeast at this time.\nUpdate 2 \u2014 Jan 30, 2020: The rollout of revamped \u200cApple Maps\u200c in the Southeast and Central United States now appears to be complete. This includes the addition of traffic lights and stop signs in \u200cApple Maps\u200c on CarPlay.",

        "title": "AirPods Pro owners complain of worse noise cancellation after firmware updates",
        "body": "Some AirPods Pro owners have been complaining about degraded noise cancellation in recent weeks, claiming that Apple\u2019s latest earbuds suddenly got less effective at silencing ambient noise after receiving a firmware update. Rtings.com retested the AirPods Pro and found their noise canceling capabilities to be worse after firmware update 2C54. But affected customers say the trouble began even earlier with firmware version 2B588, which rolled out in November. (Apple later pulled firmware 2C54 for unknown reasons.)\nThis phenomenon \u2014 the perception that a software update has \u201cruined\u201d noise cancellation \u2014 has also been reported by owners of Bose and Sony headphones. Bose has faced a months-long controversy over its QuietComfort 35 II headphones, with some customers insisting that an update drastically worsened the level of noise cancellation from the cans compared to their original out-of-the-box performance. There are a lot of people who say they\u2019ve experienced this issue, and it\u2019s escalated to the point where Bose is now visiting customers at home to get a handle on whatever\u2019s going on. Sony also dealt with similar complaints about its 1000XM3 headphones.\nAre companies really screwing up this badly, or are customers imagining a problem where one doesn\u2019t exist? The Rtings tests suggest something changed; the site found that Apple has also been slightly tweaking the sound profile of the AirPods Pro with these updates. A few editors at The Verge think they\u2019ve noticed a difference, and others haven\u2019t, but that\u2019s by no means scientific.\nSince the original AirPods, Apple has chosen to make the firmware update process completely invisible to customers. The entire process happens in the background without so much as a single notification. You can\u2019t reject AirPods software updates, nor is there any direct way to force the update process on demand; you plug a charging cable into your AirPods case, put them near your iPhone, and wait. Once a firmware update is installed, you\u2019ll notice the new version in settings.\n(To check, open Settings, then pick General, then About. Whenever your AirPods are connected to your iPhone or iPad, you\u2019ll see a section for them beneath the \u201cEID\u201d row.)\nThis everything-happens-in-the-background approach means there\u2019s no way to downgrade or revert an AirPods Pro update back to a previous one if you encounter a problem. Some AirPods Pro owners are convinced noise cancellation took a downturn right after that first 2B588 update, and they were left without any method of going back.\nUnlike other earbud makers including Sony and even Amazon, Apple doesn\u2019t let you adjust the intensity of noise cancellation from the settings menu. The AirPods Pro are designed to dynamically adjust how much noise cancellation is applied on the fly based on your environment.\nBut to the end user, the feature is either on or off, and that\u2019s not what I\u2019d call ideal. Some people always want the maximum amount \u2014 especially on a plane or during a noisy commute \u2014 but others can feel a slight discomfort from the noise cancellation technology (or in some cases even get a little dizzy) when it\u2019s fully cranked up.\nIt\u2019s possible that Apple decided to turn the maximum noise canceling knob down ever so slightly without telling anyone to avoid any ill effects, but I really hope not. Letting customers choose from multiple levels of noise cancellation would make the AirPods Pro a hair more complicated to use, but might solve this situation for everyone. People who want their cocoon of silence (and have no issues when noise cancellation is dialed up to 11) can have it, and everyone else can find whatever level offers the best balance of comfort and NC.",
