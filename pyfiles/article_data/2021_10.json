        "title": "Apple Unveils Redesigned MacBook Pro With Notch, Added Ports, M1 Pro or M1 Max Chip, and More",
        "body": "Apple today announced its long-awaited major redesign for the MacBook Pro, featuring configurations with the M1 Pro and M1 Max chip, a mini-LED display with ProMotion, an HDMI port and SDXC card reader, charging with MagSafe 3, a notch housing a 1080p webcam, and more.\nThe MacBook Pro features a new design and is available with 14.2-inch and 16.2-inch display sizes. The 14.2-inch model is 15.5mm thick and weighs 3.5 pounds, while the 16.2-inch model is 16.8mm thick and weighs 4.7 pounds. The all-new aluminum enclosure also contains a completely new thermal design. It continues to be available in Silver and Space Gray.\nThere are now more ports available, with the right side of the machine offering an HDMI port, a Thunderbolt 4 port, and an SDXC card reader. The left side of the machine features a \u200cMagSafe\u200c 3 port, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, and a headphone jack. The keyboard now has a full-height function key row in place of the Touch Bar and the entire keyboard area is black.\nThe MacBook Pro features significantly reduced display borders that are 3.5mm thick, with a notch out of the top of the display for the webcam. The webcam now offers a 1080p resolution with a wider aperture, a larger image sensor, and benefits from an improved image signal processor.\nThe display itself is a mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR display, which also features ProMotion for refresh rates up to 120Hz. The Liquid Retina XDR display offers 1,000 nits of sustained brightness, 1,600 nits of peak brightness, and a million to one contrast ratio.\nThe new MacBook Pro also features improved studio-quality mics and speakers that support Spatial Audio, with the 16-inch model containing a six-speaker system.\nThe MacBook Pro now features magnetic charging with \u200cMagSafe\u200c 3, which gives the device fast charging for up to 50 percent charge in 30 minutes. It remains possible to charge using the Thunderbolt ports. When playing back video, the 14.2-inch model offers up to 17 hours of battery life, while the 16.2-inch model can deliver up to 21 hours of video playback.\nThe redesigned MacBook Pro features configurations with two new Apple silicon chips. Apple's The \u200cM1 Pro\u200c chip is a scaled-up, more powerful variant of the M1 chip. The \u200cM1 Pro\u200c chip features an 8-core or 10-core CPU, 16-core GPU, a more capable Media Engine, more Thunderbolt controllers, support for up to 32GB of unified memory, and more. The \u200cM1 Max\u200c chip features the same 10-core CPU as the \u200cM1 Pro\u200c, but includes a 24-core or 32-core GPU with support for up to 64GB of unified memory.\nThe new MacBook Pro is available to pre-order today, with the first orders arriving to customers next week.\nAdditional Coverage:",

        "body": "Apple says apps must offer a way to delete your account starting in early 2022 Users in some countries have another way to report issues with apps too.\nDevelopers who let users create an account in their iOS, iPadOS and macOS apps will soon have to offer people a method of deleting their accounts in apps too. Apple says that as of January 31st, all app submissions (including updates) will need to include the option.\nThe company announced this requirement alongside other App Store guideline changes at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June as part of a push to give users more control over their data. As The Verge notes, Apple is only requiring developers to let people \"initiate deletion of their account from within the app,\" so apps might send you to a website or even a chat with an agent before you can actually close your account.\nIt remains to be seen how useful this requirement will actually be in practice, given the tricks many developers employ to encourage you to remain as a user. Still, if you have an account in an app, deleting it will be slightly less of a headache, which can't be a bad thing. This will hopefully make it easier for people to ditch subscriptions and apps they aren't actually using.\nElsewhere, App Store pages on iOS 15, iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey (which is still in beta) now have a Report a Problem button, so you can flag any issues or concerns you have with an app to Apple. The feature is available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US for now. Apple will roll out the button to more regions later.",

        "title": "Apple and Disney among companies backing groups against US climate bill",
        "body": "Some of America\u2019s most prominent companies, including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Disney, are backing business groups that are fighting landmark climate legislation, despite their own promises to combat the climate crisis, a new analysis has found.\nA clutch of corporate lobby groups and organizations have mobilized to oppose the proposed $3.5tn budget bill put forward by Democrats, which contains unprecedented measures to drive down planet-heating gases. The reconciliation bill has been called the \u201cthe most significant climate action in our country\u2019s history\u201d by Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the US Senate.\nMost large US corporations have expressed concern over the climate crisis or announced their own goals to cut greenhouse gases. Jeff Bezos, one of the world\u2019s richest people, has said that the climate crisis is the \u201cbiggest threat to our planet\u201d and the company he founded, Amazon, has created a pledge for businesses to cut their emissions to net zero by 2040. Microsoft has promised to be \u201ccarbon negative\u201d within a decade from now and Disney is aiming to use only renewable-sourced electricity within the same timeframe.\nBut these leading companies, and others, either support or actively steer the very lobby groups that are attempting to sink the bill that carries the weight of Joe Biden\u2019s ambitions to tackle the climate crisis, threatening one of the last major legislative efforts that will help decide whether parts of the world plunge into a new, barely livable climatic state.\n\u201cMajor corporations love to tell us how committed they are to addressing the climate crisis and building a sustainable future, but behind closed doors, they are funding the very industry trade groups that are fighting tooth and nail to stop the biggest climate change bill ever,\u201d said Kyle Herrig, president of watchdog group Accountable.US, which compiled the analysis.\nNone of the companies contacted by the Guardian would rebuke the stance of the lobby groups they are part of and none said they would review their links to these groups.\n\u201cHiding behind these shady groups doesn\u2019t just put our environment at risk \u2013 it puts these companies\u2019 household names and reputations in serious jeopardy,\u201d Herrig said.\nThe US Chamber of Commerce has vowed to \u201cdo everything we can to prevent this tax raising, job killing reconciliation bill from becoming law\u201d. The leading business lobby group\u2019s board includes executives from companies including Microsoft, Intuit, United Airlines and Deloitte, which have all expressed concern over climate change \u2013 Deloitte even includes teaching the climate crisis to employees in its staff training \u2013 and have made various promises to reduce emissions.\nAnother group, the Business Roundtable, has said it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the passage of the bill, largely because it raises taxes on the wealthy. The organization is made up of company chief executives, including Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, who has called for stronger action on the climate emergency from governments and businesses. Other members include Andy Jassy, chief executive of Amazon, Sundar Pichai, who heads Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, and Darren Woods, chief executive of the oil giant Exxon.\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group that includes Bayer and AstraZeneca among its members, has run adverts attacking the proposed bill. The Rate Coalition, another lobby group that has Disney, FedEx and Verizon as members, is also planning an advertising blitz to help kill off the legislation while the National Association of Manufacturers \u2013 backed by Johnson&Johnson, Dow and Goodyear \u2013 has said it is attempting to upend the bill \u201cin every way you can imagine\u201d.\nThis blitz threatens legislation that already faces a perilous path through Congress, with the president needing every Senate Democrat to vote for the package for it to pass. Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat from West Virginia who is a major recipient of donations from the fossil fuel industry, has said the climate section of the bill \u201cmakes no sense\u201d and has demanded that subsidies for coal, oil and gas remain in place. Republicans universally oppose the bill.\nIf enacted, the bill would establish a system to phase out emissions from the US electricity system, provide payments to prop up carbon-free nuclear energy and support the adoption of electric vehicles.\nAs the first major attempt at climate legislation in more than a decade, the bill comes at a time when scientists warn the world is rapidly running out of time to avoid catastrophic climate change. The legislation\u2019s failure would not only wound Biden politically, it would also likely hinder attempts to prod other countries into more drastic action at crucial upcoming UN climate talks in Scotland.\n\u201cThis is a historic chance to end fossil fuel subsidies and invest in a livable future,\u201d said Lukas Ross, climate program manager at Friends of the Earth. \u201cWe can\u2019t waste this opportunity to pass meaningful climate legislation because there might not be another.\u201d",

        "body": "In a new interview, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he's worried about the \"endless, mindless scrolling\" behavior that social media inspires people to undertake and is generally concerned that people are \"using technology too much.\"\nThe interview conducted with Bustle touched heavily on Apple's support of Shine, an app designed to fight social stigmas around mental health issues and is \"another powerful example of how technology can be used to help improve people's lives,\" according to Cook. During the interview, Cook said that \"mental health is a crisis\" and that he tackles the day-to-day stress of being Apple's CEO by meditation and \"being out in nature and feeling so insignificant in the world.\"\nTalking about online and technology addiction, Cook repeated a claim he's made previously, having said that \"technology should serve humanity and not the other way around\" and that he's fundamentally worried that people are using technology too much, and Apple's aim is to try and help them.\nI've always thought that technology should serve humanity and not the other way around. And I always worried about people using technology too much. And so, we came out with Screen Time to try to give people a true reading of the amount of time they're really spending on their devices because generally, it's a lot more than they say.\nCook went on to state that the \"endless scrolling\" of social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, although not mentioned directly, are surrounding users with \"negativity.\" He said that Apple wants its customers to enjoy their products to connect with family and friends, not to use them for \"endless, mindless scrolling.\"\nAza Raskin, the creator of the infinite scrolling mechanism on social media, said in 2019 that he is \"so sorry\" for his invention, adding that he regrets what it's done to society. He said the goal with the idea was to help create the \"most seamless experience possible for users,\" but that regrettably, it has turned out to be a ploy to \"keep them online for as long as possible.\"\nThe Shine app with a \"mission to make caring for your mental health easier, more representative, and more inclusive\" was crowned Apple's best app of 2020 is available to download for free on the App Store [Direct Link].",

        "body": "Apple today announced that it will be holding a special event on Monday, October 18 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The event is set to take place at the Steve Jobs Theater on the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California, and it will once again be a digital only event.\nWhen there are a lot of products coming in the fall months, Apple often holds a second October or November event, which is the case in 2021. Rumors have been teasing redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models for months now, and it's looking like Apple is finally ready to release them.\nUnleashed! These next six days are going to speed by. #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/0ops2bVPvl \u2014 Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) October 12, 2021\nRumors suggest the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will have an overhauled design with thinner bezels and larger displays, and we've already seen hints of 3024 x 1964 and 3456 x 2234 resolutions, respectively, which would enable 2x Retina for sharper, crisper images and text. The new MacBook Pro will use an M1X chip, which is an faster, more powerful version of the M1 , plus it could support up to 32GB RAM.\nThe new MacBook Pro will mark the return of MagSafe connectivity, a charging feature that will replace USB-C. Apple is also bringing back the HDMI port and SD card slot, and there will be no Touch Bar, with Apple instead re-adopting a standard function row of keys. The 2021 MacBook Pro models will be a throwback to the pre-2016 MacBook Pro designs, with Apple undoing many of the changes that were introduced with the 2016 revamp.\nWe thought the AirPods 3 might come out at Apple's September event because it makes sense to unveil AirPods alongside iPhones, but that didn't happen, so we could instead see them at the October event. The new \u200cAirPods\u200c will have shorter \u200cAirPods\u200c Pro-like stems and an AirPods Pro-style case, but will continue to be a more affordable option without Active Noise Cancellation.\nWe'll likely find out when macOS Monterey is going to launch, and Apple could also have some surprises like an M1X version of the Mac mini in store, but aside from MacBook Pro models and \u200cAirPods 3\u200c, we haven't heard rumors of anything else coming out this year.\nApple plans to stream the fall event live on its website , on YouTube, and on the Apple TV through the \u200c\u200cApple TV\u200c\u200c app. For those unable to watch, MacRumors will be providing full event coverage both on MacRumors.com and the MacRumorsLive Twitter account",

        "body": "Update, January 12, 2022: It may be hard to believe, but just three short months after Apple Polishing Cloth mania swept the nation, the product appears to be back in stock and ready to ship. Finally, we can all polish the months and years of detritus off of our computer and phone screens.\nOriginal story: Between ongoing supply chain issues, chip shortages, and pent-up demand, Apple's new MacBook Pros were always going to be hard to get. They've been up for preorder for less than 24 hours, and if you order one now, you probably won't get it before November or December.\nBut the new laptops aren't Apple's only in-demand product: The shipping times for Apple's $19 microfiber Polishing Cloth have also already slipped back into mid to late November. Unfortunately, this means that your compatible iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and iPods will need to remain unpolished for at least a month. It's unclear whether the delays are being caused by low supply, overwhelming demand, or some combination of both.\nAdvertisement\nThe Polishing Cloth boasts support for an impressive range of Apple products, which Apple lists out in detail on the Cloth's product page. The list includes iPhones as old as 2014's iPhone 6, every generation of Apple Watch, and even the old iPod nano and iPod shuffle. Without testing, however, we can't confirm whether the Polishing Cloth will adequately polish older unsupported devices or non-Apple gadgets like Android phones or the Nintendo Switch.\nThe Polishing Cloth isn't a new Apple product\u2014it has shipped with the company's $5,000 Pro Display XDR since that monitor was released back in 2019. But this is the first time that Apple has offered its best, most premium polishing experience to the users of its other devices.\nNote: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs.\nListing image by Apple",

        "title": "Apple's Privacy Rules to Blame for Facebook's Lower Than Expected Quarterly Growth, Says Zuckerberg",
        "body": "Apple's privacy rules are \"negatively affecting\" Facebook, and its business, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg claimed during its most recent earnings call.\nAs a quick refresher, starting with iOS 14.5 and all newer versions of iOS and iPadOS, Apple requires that apps ask for users' permission to track them across other apps and websites. Under the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, the latest change gives users a choice on whether they wish to be tracked for ads or other purposes.\nIn the weeks leading up to ATT's launch, Facebook was vocal about its displeasure with the change, explicitly framing it as unfavorable for small businesses who use its platform to target customers. When users opt-out of tracking, Facebook and other ad providers have less data for targeted advertisement, possibly, in one example provided by Facebook, making it harder for local businesses to target ads to potential customers nearby.\nContinuing on its anti-Apple's privacy rules campaign, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was quick to blame Apple for his company's lower than expected growth in the third quarter of the year. Kicking off the earnings call, Zuckerberg said Apple is \"negatively affecting\" Facebook but that he believes the company will be able to \"navigate\" the challenges Apple is presenting thanks to its long-term investments.\nAs expected, we did experience revenue headwinds this quarter, including from Apple's changes that are not only negatively affecting our business, but millions of small businesses in what is already a difficult time for them in the economy. Sheryl and Dave will talk about this more later, but the bottom line is we expect we'll be able to navigate these headwinds over time with investments that we're already making today.\nWhile Zuckerberg and the Facebook executive team hold Apple's changes accountable for this quarter's performance, it may also be an asset. Zuckerberg has in the past stated that ATT could ultimately help Facebook, and it's a sentiment he again repeated during the earning's call.\nApple's changes, according to Zuckerberg, are making \"e-commerce and customer acquisition less effective on the web.\" Still, Facebook could benefit from the lessened effectiveness as \"solutions that allow businesses to set up shop right inside our apps will become increasingly attractive,\" Zuckerberg added.\nFacebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, also criticized Apple and its privacy rules, going as far as to claim that the new rules are negatively impacting Facebook while benefiting Apple's own advertising business.\nWe've been open about the fact that there were headwinds coming \u2013 and we've experienced that in Q3. The biggest is the impact of Apple's iOS14 changes, which have created headwinds for others in the industry as well, major challenges for small businesses, and advantaged Apple's own advertising business.\nDespite Facebook facing an avalanche of pressure amid leaked internal documents and scrutiny, Sandberg pointed the finger at Apple for Facebook's lackluster performance this quarter. \"Overall, if it wasn't for Apple's iOS 14 changes, we would have seen positive quarter-over-quarter revenue growth,\" Sandberg said.\nOne document as part of a trove of internal documentation leaked to the press this week indicates that Facebook is increasingly concerned about the youth demographic on its platform. Specifically, Facebook wants to take additional steps to make its platform more attractive to younger users, a portion of the online audience that is increasingly shying away from Facebook, according to leaked company documents.\nOne area in which Facebook hopes to achieve a more appealing look to younger users is by steering them away from Apple's iMessage platform. Zuckerberg said during the earnings call that iMessage is \"growing in popularity,\" potentially posing a risk to some of Facebook's messaging platforms, such as Messenger.\nApple has time and time again defended App Tracking Transparency, claiming it simply wants to give users a choice on whether to be tracked or not. In a video posted to its YouTube channel following ATT's launch, Apple said that \"some apps have trackers embedded in them that are taking more data than they need. Sharing it with third parties, like advertisers and data brokers... This has been happening without your knowledge or permission. Your information is for sale. You have become the product.\"\nApple's CEO, Tim Cook, has also been vocal about Facebook in the past. At a speech at a privacy conference earlier in the year, Cook implied that platforms such as Facebook lead to polarization and violence. \"If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform,\" Cook said.",

        "title": "Google 'colluded' with Facebook to bypass Apple privacy",
        "body": "Several years ago, to deal with the competitive threat of header bidding \u2013 a way for multiple ad exchanges to get a fair shot at winning an automated auction for ad space \u2013 Google allegedly hatched a plan called \"Jedi\" to ensure that its ad exchange always won.\nAnd in 2017, after Facebook announced plans to support header bidding, Google, it's claimed, struck a deal with Facebook \u2013 dubbed \"Jedi Blue\" \u2013 in which the two internet behemoths would \"work together to identify users using Apple products,\" and set up \"quotas for how often Facebook would win publishers\u2019 auctions.\"\nThe Jedi project is described in an amended complaint, filed Friday, that expands the December 2020 antitrust claim against Google, brought by Texas, 14 other US states, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\nThe Texas antitrust case against Google is one of four ongoing government-backed claims in the US alleging the web search giant competes unfairly. A year ago, the US Justice Department filed a federal antitrust lawsuit. Colorado also filed a complaint last December on behalf of a group of 38 states. Then there's the complaint filed in July over Android and the Google Play Store, backed by 36 US states and commonwealths, along with Washington DC.\nThe amended complaint in the Texas litigation expands on a claim in the initial complaint about Google's alleged effort to delay privacy legislation, with help from Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, at a closed-door meeting between the corporations on August 6, 2019.\nWe have been successful in slowing down and delaying the [European ePrivacy Regulation] process and have been working behind the scenes hand in hand with the other companies\nTo make the case that Google's publicly stated concern about privacy is a sham, the new text describes a Google document prepared in advance of the meeting that said, \"we have been successful in slowing down and delaying the [ePrivacy Regulation] process and have been working behind the scenes hand in hand with the other companies,\" referring to the European Commission's data protection rules.\nHeader bidding emerged around 2015 as a way to bypass Google's control of the ad auction ecosystem and the fees it charged. By 2016, the court filing explains, about 70 per cent of major publishers were using header bidding to offer their ad space to multiple ad exchanges at the same time, not just Google, to get the best deal from advertisers.\n\"Google quickly realized that this innovation substantially threatened its exchange\u2019s ability to demand a very large \u2013 19 to 22 percent \u2013 cut on all advertising transactions,\" the revised complaint says. \"Header bidding also undermined Google\u2019s ability to trade on inside and non-public information from one side of the market to advantage itself on the other \u2013 a practice that in other markets would be considered insider trading or front running.\"\nGoogle secretly made its own exchange win, even when another exchange submitted a higher bid\nInitially, the amended complaint says, Google appeared to accommodate publishers by allowing them to use its servers to send their ad space inventory to be sold on more than one exchange at a time.\n\"However, Google secretly made its own exchange win, even when another exchange submitted a higher bid,\" the amended complaint says. \"Google\u2019s codename for this program was Jedi \u2013 a reference to Star Wars.\"\n\"And as one Google employee explained internally, Google deliberately designed Jedi to avoid competition, and Jedi consequently harmed publishers. In Google\u2019s words, the Jedi program 'generates suboptimal yields for publishers and serious risks of negative media coverage if exposed externally.'\"\nGoogle's dominance of the online ad ecosystem, the complaint argues, allows it to collect between 22 and 42 per cent of ad dollars that would otherwise go to publishers and web content producers.\n'Forestall and diminish child privacy protections'\nIt's also alleged that Google tried to coordinate efforts among other tech firms \"to forestall and diminish child privacy protections in proposed regulations by the FTC\" and legislators. The document Google prepared for the August 6, 2019 tech company cabal indicated the ad biz wanted its peers to align their positions on child safety and \"sought to rein in Microsoft\" so it would not compete on privacy.\nThe alleged Jedi Blue partnership between Google and Facebook, outlined in the initial complaint, is explained in more detail in the latest filing. The two companies, it's said, have been working closely to help Facebook \"recognize users in auctions and bid and win more often.\"\n\"For example, Google and Facebook have integrated their software development kits (SDKs) so that Google can pass Facebook data for user ID cookie matching,\" the amended complaint says. \"They also coordinated with each other to harm publishers through the adoption of Unified Pricing rules\u2026\"\nThe filing continued:\nThe companies also have been working together to improve Facebook\u2019s ability to recognize users using browsers with blocked cookies, on Apple devices, and on Apple\u2019s Safari browser, thereby circumventing one Big Tech company\u2019s efforts to compete by offering users better privacy.\nThe Register asked Google whether it wished to comment on the allegations in the amended complaint, and in particular to explain how the company reconciles past statements like, \"We take privacy very seriously,\" with alleged internal sentiment about working behind the scenes to hinder privacy regulation.\n\"Just because [Texas Attorney General Ken] Paxton says something doesn't make it true,\" a Google spokesperson said in an email to The Register. \"We've been clear about our support for consistent privacy rules around the globe. For example, we have been calling on Congress to pass federal privacy legislation for years.\"\nIn a message to El Reg, Zach Edwards, co-founder of web analytics biz Victory Medium, said the expanded claims in the complaint should alarm publishers.\n\"The newly unredacted documents paint a picture of Google and Facebook's behavior that should not surprise anyone, but publishers and ad buyers should be deeply concerned about the tricks, exploits, backroom deals and arbitrary fees that have gutted their revenues over the past decade, all while both Google and Facebook knew they were being deceptive,\" he said.\n\"The references to 'Jedi Blue' and various Star Wars references in the now-unredacted sections of these documents are extremely gross, and everyone needs to understand that Google was attempting to poison the head bidding advertising standard by creating numerous problems, and apparently overtly lying about certain problems to publishers, in order to 'convince publishers to make changes themselves.'\"\nGoogle, he said, branded its relationship with Facebook as if they were Jedi in the Star Wars franchise who could manipulate people with mind tricks.\n\"Google thinks so little of publishers and other advertising buyers that they executed on plans to lie to these partners, in order to cripple a separate advertising standard that was competing against Google on certain publisher websites,\" Edwards said. \u00ae",

Apple is still stopping short of implementing a vaccine mandate that would require employees to be vaccinated to return to the office. Apple corporate employees that have been vaccinated will need to do a rapid test once per week.\nAs for retail staff, unvaccinated employees will need to test twice per week instead of on a daily basis, and vaccinated retail employees will need to take a rapid test once per week.\nEmployees submitting to testing will be able to use at-home rapid tests that can be picked up from Apple's corporate offices and retail stores. Tests take 15 minutes and require employees to self-report the results.\nMany other tech companies have implemented vaccine mandates, which Apple has declined to do so far, but as Bloomberg points out, Apple may soon need to change its rules. The Biden administration is requiring all federal contractors to require their employees to be vaccinated by December 8, and Apple sells products to the government.\nApple has asked employees to provide their vaccination status by October 24, and they'll also need to provide proof in the near future. The new testing requirements go into effect on November 1.\nApple is now planning for employees to return to the office at least three days per week starting in January.",

        "body": "Apple made some bold claims about the performance of its new M1 Pro and M1 Max SoCs, including their graphics capabilities. A quick and dirty number crunch based on the known graphics performance of the M1 shows that those claims are likely justified.\n4 Reviews\nApple has launched its long-awaited and all-new 14-inch and 16-inch models. Unlike in the past, and thanks to the thermal efficiency of Apple\u2019s new M1 Pro and M1 Max SoCs, both models can be fitted with the fastest silicon that Apple offers. In the past, a chip like the M1 Max with 10-core CPU and up to 32-core GPU might only have made it into the larger device.\nWe already have an insight into the single-core and multi-core performance of the new chips thanks to leaked GeekBench 5 scores. But what of the graphics performance? Now that we know the exact configurations of these chips, we can start to deduce the graphics performance of each chipset based on the performance of the GPU in the original M1 chip. As Apple highlighted in its keynote, its new chips keep the M1 designations because they are scaled up versions of the M1 architecture.\nWe\u2019ve put together this short estimated GPU performance list based on the assumption that Apple has not clocked the new GPU cores higher in the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips or made any other changes. Based on this, we have come up with the following teraflops (TF) performance estimates:\nM1 8-core = 2.6 TF\nM1 Pro 14-core = 4.5 TF\nM1 Pro 16-core = 5.2 TF\nM1 Max 24-core = 7.8 TF\nM1 Max 32-core = 10.4 TF\nThe performance of all variants is exceptional, particularly given how much less power they draw than competing chipsets from Intel, Nvidia and AMD. As Apple pointed out during its presentation, even at peak performance, the M1 Max is drawing up to 100 W less power than a high-end PC laptop with discrete GPU. Yet, the 32-core GPU in the M1 Max produces identical performance to a desktop class Nvidia RTX 2080 GPU (10.07 TF) and Sony\u2019s latest PS5 gaming console (10.28 TF). It\u2019s jaw dropping performance in notebooks that deliver up to a claimed 21 hours of battery life as well.\nBuy the Apple M1-powered 13-inch MacBook Pro from Amazon for US$1,470.",

        "title": "It's been six months and AirTags still do not support Family Sharing",
        "body": "Apple's new AirTag item trackers have been making their way into the hands of customers since Friday, and while the company has tried to describe the ways that they can be used to find lost items, many users are still surprised and disappointed to learn that the location of an AirTag can't be shared with other family members.\nOn the face of it, sharing the location of an AirTag via Apple's Family Sharing feature should be a no-brainer, since individual members in a Family Sharing group can use the Find My app to see the location of other family members' Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, AirPods, and Apple Watches.\nGiven those Family Sharing privileges, many users have understandably assumed that an AirTag attached to an item that's regularly used by more than one person in the household (a set of keys, for example) could be tracked by multiple family members within Find My.\nUnfortunately, however, AirTags don't work like other Apple devices in Find My, and several users have taken to the MacRumors forums, Reddit, and Apple's community support site to share their displeasure after learning about the Family Sharing limitation:\nApple Communities user Amadeus4000: I received my first two AirTags today. One for each of our dogs. I was disappointed to see I couldn't share them with my wife. That would have made a lot of sense.\nApple Communities user MikeyPD: It is extremely disappointing that there is not currently an option to share AirTags with family members. This is a very convenient feature that Tile (as well as other trackers) offers. I suppose I should have looked into this before ordering them. I suppose it just seemed like such a no-brainer feature that I didn't even think to checking. I hope this is functionality they add soon. If Tile could figure out how to do it I am sure Apple can. This is kind of a bummer.\nMacRumors forum member Mr X: Surprised that Apple didn't include a share option at least with official family share members. Tile used to allow me to share \"items.\" For example, me and the wife both have our own cars, but we swap at random. She's always losing hers in the house and now I won't be able to find them, only she can. Hope they add this feature.\nMacRumors forum member Leebroath: 1. Husband opens brand new Air Tags and registers one to his phone\n2. Places one in the Belkin holder, then connects to only set of car keys\n3. 8am Wife picks up car keys in morning, drives to work, husband goes to bed as on nightshift\n4. 4pm Wife finishes work but can't remember where car keys are, confused she looks into Find My\u2026\n5. *Fail* If a husband and wife are on the same iCloud Family Sharing plan, then it should be possible for each person to see the AirTag regardless of whose phone it is.\nAs Apple has explained, the only AirTag privilege afforded to people in an iCloud Family Sharing group is that they can silence the \"AirTag Detected\" safety alert that appears when an AirTag is traveling with them that is registered to someone else. (Likewise, the owner of the AirTag can disable the safety alerts to prevent someone else's iPhone from detecting it as unwanted tracking.)\nBut that's as far as the Family Sharing functionality goes. AirTags are only meant to be owned by one person, and it's not currently possible to share an AirTag's location with another family member using another Apple ID. It's likely that Apple has omitted this feature due to privacy concerns, so whether or not it intends to introduce it in the future via some other form of implementation remains to be seen.",

        "title": "Apple says Android has up to 47x more malware than iPhone in continued pushback against sideloading",
        "body": "Amid growing pressure from private companies and governments to allow sideloading on iOS, Apple is out today with a new security paper diving into real-world data on how malware is impacting mobile devices. Along with statistics like Android having between 15 and 47 times more malware than iPhone, Apple is making its latest case against sideloading with data and recommendations from the US Department of Homeland Security, European Agency for Cybersecurity, NIST, Norton, and more.\nAs proposed legislation in the US, Europe, and elsewhere aims to force Apple to allow sideloading on iOS, the company is out today with a new security report that goes in-depth on why it believes opening up the App Store is a harmful idea. Today\u2019s paper comes as a follow-up to the guide it published in June on the benefits of its curated App Store.\nTitled \u201cBuilding a Trusted Ecosystem for Millions of Apps \u2013 A threat analysis of sideloading,\u201d the new report is a 28-page document that covers:\nCurrent mobile threat landscape\nSnapshot of common consumer mobile malware\nHow mobile malware attacks access devices\nRisks of opening the iOS ecosystem\nThe limited mechanism to distribute apps outside of the App Store\nThe impact of sidloading on iOS\nSideloading and iOS users\nGuidance from security experts\nAt the outset, Apple reiterates that it believes opening iOS to sideloading would \u201ccripple the privacy and security protections that have made iPhone so secure, and expose users to serious security risks.\u201d\nThe first page also highlights reports from Nokia in 2019 and 2020 that showed malware on Android (which supports sideloading) was between 15 to 47 times greater over the last four years than it was on iPhone.\nApple closes out its introduction by saying that \u201cmobile malware harms consumers, companies, developers, and advertisers.\u201d\nApple also claims that even users who don\u2019t want to sideload apps could be at risk if iOS was forced to open the ecosystem.\nUsers also may have no choice other than sideloading an app that they need to connect with family and friends because the app is not made available on the App Store. For example, if sideloading were permitted, some companies may choose to distribute their apps solely outside of the App Store.\nAnd another concern Apple brings up is those who would mimic the App Store or use freebies to encourage sideloading apps.\nCybercriminals may trick users into sideloading apps by mimicking the appearance of the App Store, or by touting free or expanded access to services or exclusive features.\nThe new Apple report also mentions recent Android trojans like Banker.BR, TeaBot, and BlackRock, the latter of which steals login credentials from 450 online services and poses as the popular Clubhouse app.\nApple believes that \u201cSideloading would make it easier and cheaper to execute many attacks that are currently difficult and costly to execute on iOS\u201d and open a door to harming users, businesses, developers, and advertisers.\nIn closing, Apple cites seven sources from the US Department of Homeland Security to the European Agency for Cybersecurity to Norton to help make its case. You can find Apple\u2019s full October security paper here.\nIn contrast, European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, previously said Apple shouldn\u2019t use privacy and security concerns as a shield for anticompetitive behavior. And Epic Games plus the Coalition for App Fairness of course agree with that belief.",

        "body": "Update October 22, 2021: This appears to have been an error on Apple\u2019s end. New purchases are no longer showing 6% Daily Cash. The company has not yet responded to 9to5Mac\u2019s request for clarification.\nApple appears to be rolling out an upgraded Daily Cash back offer for Apple Card users. As first spotted by Tailosive Tech on Twitter and confirmed by 9to5Mac, Apple is now offering 6% Daily Cash back on purchases made from the Apple Online Store.\nApple doesn\u2019t appear to have officially announced this promotion anywhere, but it comes ahead of the holiday shopping season. Apple ran a similar 6% Daily Cash promotion for Apple Store purchases two years ago for the holiday shopping season.\nThis year\u2019s 6% Daily Cash promo appears to have kicked in sometime this week. It appears to be valid for all purchases of Apple hardware, doubling the usual 3% cash back rate on Apple purchases with Apple Card. 9to5Mac confirmed the 6% Daily Cash promo by purchasing an iPhone 13 Pro Max case from the Apple Store Online.\nNotably, many people are seeing this 6% Daily Cash promotion be applied in time for their new MacBook Pro orders. Getting 6% back on those purchases is certainly a nice bonus given the high price of the new machines.\nWe have not been able to confirm whether the promo applies to App Store purchases, but the 2019 promo notably excluded that category as well as purchases of Apple services like iCloud storage or Apple Music.\nApple Card Daily Cash is issued at the end of every day, and appears directly via your Apple Cash card in the Wallet app on your iPhone. You can then transfer that money to your bank, apply it to your Apple Card balance, spend it using Apple Pay, or use it to fund Apple Cash transactions with friends and family.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Apple for comment and will update if we hear back. Have you noticed 6% Daily Cash on any recent Apple Card purchases? Let us know down in the comments!\nHaven't seen anyone show this but perhaps there's a 6% cash back promo Apple hasn't announced yet? I just hope this isn't a bug \ud83d\ude02 Didn't apply to my AirPods 3 so possibly if you spend over a certain amount they go to 6%? pic.twitter.com/PVc8sDsshF \u2014 Tailosive Tech (@TailosiveTech) October 21, 2021",

        "title": "A common charger: better for consumers and the environment",
        "body": "Having to use different USB cables to charge our smartphones, tablets or cameras can be frustrating. The EU wants to make this a thing of the past, making life easier and reducing e-waste. To find out what the common charger proposal is about, we talked to Anna Cavazzini, the chair of Parliament's consumer protection committee. Read the summary of our Facebook live interview below.\nThe common charger proposal\n\u201cThe European Parliament has been pushing for 10 years for one standard, so that we no longer need lots of cables, just one,\u201d said Cavazzini. The European Commission tried to bring companies on board via voluntary agreements, which partially worked. However, not all companies have agreed, and that is why the Commission has finally proposed legislation for one common standard for chargers.\nWhat does this mean for consumers?\nThe proposal consists of two partsl: one is a common standard for cables and devices, meaning they would be interchangeable in the future. This is good for consumers, as they will be able to charge their devices with any cable.\nThe second part is about unbundling. \u201cIf I buy a new phone, often I automatically get a new cable,\u201d Cavazzini said. \u201cIn future, phones and devices will no longer be automatically sold with cables and this will reduce electronic waste.\u201d That would mean consumers would need to buy the cable separately. But as most people already have cables, this should not involve large costs.\nWhen can we expect the common charger in the EU?\nAt the earliest the rules could already enter into force in 2024. Cavazzini hopes Parliament will finish work on the proposal and reach an agreement with the Council of ministers, which co-legislates with the Parliament by the end of 2022. Countries would then have two years to implement the law.\nParliament\u2019s ideas\nAlthough work on the proposal has not officially started in the Parliament, some MEPs have already called for all devices to be included. \u201cThe Commission\u2019s proposal includes a lot of devices, but for example not e-readers,\u201d Cavazzini said. Other MEPs say that the legislation needs to be future-proof, for example taking wireless charging into account.\nWill this stifle innovation?\nAccording to the MEP, the industry often brings up the argument that legislation could hamper innovation. \u201cI don\u2019t see it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe proposal states that if a new standard emerges that is better than USB-C, we can adapt the rules.\u201d\nHow much will e-waste be reduced?\nThere are different estimates, but one number that is often mentioned is roughly 1000 tonnes per year. \u201cElectronic waste is the fastest growing waste stream in the EU. If we really want to implement the Green Deal and curb our use of resources, we need to pull out all the stops,\u201d said Cavazzini.\nBackground\nAfter a decade of pushing by the Parliament, the Commission presented a proposal on the common charger in September 2021. It would make USB-C the standard port for all smartphones, tablets, cameras, headphones, portable speakers and handheld videogame consoles.",

        "title": "120Hz scrolling not currently supported by many Mac apps, including Safari",
        "body": "The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro are getting rave reviews, and for good reason: industry-leading performance, impressive battery life, beautifully rich displays, and the return of ports that make working professionals happy.\nOne of the big surprises at the Apple event announcement was the inclusion of 120Hz ProMotion on these laptops. Just like the smooth scrolling experiences on iPad Pro and the new iPhone 13 Pro series, Apple promised that the high refresh rate of the new display would make \u201ctasks like scrolling through web pages super fluid.\u201d Unfortunately, the availability of ProMotion in apps on macOS is currently sporadic and incomplete, leaving much to be desired.\nYou may recall that there was some ProMotion confusion when the iPhone 13 Pro launched in September. In that case, Apple eventually followed up with additional documentation on what developers needed to do to adopt the feature fully, as well as promising a software update to fix some related bugs.\nIn the case of the Mac, the situation is much less clear. Based on testing with the new MacBook Pro, Catalyst apps generally run at 120Hz as you would expect, as they appear to inherit the iOS behaviors directly. Full-screen games and Metal apps can also render at the full 120Hz. The OS itself runs smoothly so switching between spaces and dragging windows around is delightful. The problem is day-to-day standard Mac apps mostly do not \u2026 or at least some parts do and some parts don\u2019t.\nIn particular, the smooth scrolling that ProMotion can deliver is not being utilized in many applications. The most noticeable offender is Safari, an app that Apple specifically called out in the ProMotion section of the event presentation for taking advantage of the new display\u2019s high refresh rate.\nFor third-party apps, Apple has also not released any supporting documentation to instruct developers on what to do. You can see, for example, this thread on the Google Chrome forums where Chromium developers want to take advantage of the ProMotion display, but have reached dead ends in actually knowing where/how to start.\nUltimately, there\u2019s a gap in the software stack that Apple needs to close to enable consistently smooth interactions across its own apps and third-party programs. Hopefully, software updates addressing these issues are coming soon. The hardware is certainly capable of driving a smooth 120Hz experience.\nHilariously, Moshen Chan on Twitter showed how he could get smooth 120Hz scrolling performance on the MacBook Pro by virtualizing Windows to run Chrome, whereas native Mac Safari scrolling lagged behind:\nNative Safari still 60fps and not 120Hz ProMotion in new MacBook Pro. But you get smooth 120Hz scrolling with x86 emulated Chrome running under virtualized Windows 11. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/cCq9mU2jO5 \u2014 Moshen Chan (@paranoidroid) October 29, 2021",

        "title": "Apple M1 Max Dominates (34% Faster) Alienware RTX 3080 Laptop In Adobe Premier Benchmark",
        "body": "Here in the early going, benchmark comparisons pitting Apple's latest custom silicon against other hardware are a mixed bag of results. That's how it will probably go when the revamped MacBook Pro 16 and 14 laptops hit the street\u2014how they fare will depend on the application. One that appears to favor Apple's newest silicon is Adobe Premiere Pro, with a leaked M1 Max benchmark score trouncing an Alienware laptop outfitted with a mobile GeForce RTX 3080 GPU.\nThis is in line with Apple's claims about its M1 Max and M1 Pro , which purportedly not only deliver a huge performance gain over the company's first-gen M1 hardware, but also is supposedly capable of matching the performance of a high-end Windows laptop at a much lower power envelope. From Apple's vantage point, it's the best of all worlds.\nIt's going to depend on the benchmark and/or real-world application, though. For example, a recent entry on Geekbench showed the M1 Max posting a 68,870 Metal score. We ran some tests on our 2020 Mac mini with Apple's first-gen M1, and lo and behold, the leaked benchmark score was more than three times higher (68,870 versus 22,456). However, the leaked score couldn't hang with a couple of Windows laptops we tested, namely Lenovo's Think X1 Extreme and MSI's GE76 Raider, both with a GeForce RTX 3080 on board.\nThat's not the case in PugetBench's Adobe Premiere Pro benchmark suite. Have a look...\nClick to Enlarge (Source: PugetBench)\nThe benchmark entry identifies this as one of the new MacBook Pro systems with an M1 Mac chip wielding 10 CPU cores (eight performance cores and two efficiency cores). The number of GPU cores is not listed, but we have a hunch this is the version with 32 cores (as opposed to 24 cores, which is only available in custom orders).\nAs configured, it posted an overall score of 1,168 and a GPU score of 66. We don't have our own collection of PugetBench scores to compare against, but when sorting the database's results by mobile GeForce RTX 3080 hardware, the best showing we could find was an Alienware laptop. Here's a look...\nClick to Enlarge (Source: PugetBench)\nAccording to the benchmark listing, the Alienware laptop is configured with an 11th Gen Intel Core i7-11800H processor, GeForce RTX 3080 mobile GPU, 32GB of RAM, and Windows 10 Home.\nIt posted an o verall score of 872 and a GPU score of 68.1. So if we compare the numbers, the MacBook Pro with its M1 Max chip beat the Alienware laptop by nearly 34 percent for the overall score, while the GPU score was nearly a wash\u2014the Alienware with its GeForce RTX 3080 scored 3.2 percent higher.\nThe benchmark's Live Playback test was the differentiating factor. Everything else was relatively close, but the Live Playback score favored the M1 Max by a whopping 77 percent.\nThat makes sense if you consider the M1 Max's enormous unified GPU and CPU memory pool (64GB) and 400GB/s of memory bandwidth. Certain things that fit in memory could heavily favor Apple's silicon, as apparently depicted here, whereas discrete solutions like Ampere will flex in hardcore GPU compute chores.\nAs times goes on and more benchmarks emerge\u2014both leaked ones, and official benchmark runs after the latest MacBook Pro laptops ship out\u2014we'll have a better overall picture of performance, and where the M1 Max and M1 Pro shine.",

        "body": "by Jason Snell\nMe, back in 2015:\nGoogle to iOS users: thanks for using our apps, please enjoy Android UI conventions \u2014 Jason Snell (@jsnell) October 8, 2015\nJeff Verkoeyen, staff engineering lead for Google Design on Apple platforms, on Twitter now:\nThis year my team shifted the open source Material components libraries for iOS into maintenance mode\u2026 The time we\u2019re saving not building custom code is now invested in the long tail of UX details that really make products feel great on Apple platforms. To paraphrase Lucas Pope, we\u2019re \u201cswimming in a sea of minor things\u201d, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited about this new direction.\nOne year at the XOXO conference I was buttonholed (in the nicest way) by someone who worked on iOS apps at Google, who wanted to understand why I was so hostile about Google\u2019s apps not respecting iOS conventions and instead forcing Android conventions on iOS users.\nI felt that Google arrogantly believed that people were first and foremost users of Google\u2019s platforms, and benefited from consistency across those platforms, when the truth was that people who use iPads and iPhones expect apps to behave like every other app on the platform.\nOver the years Google has unified its design language and moved its work forward in a lot of ways that are admirable. But as Verkoeyen\u2019s Twitter thread points out, it also takes a lot of effort to reinvent your own design language when the platform provides its own for free. It\u2019s easier to be a standard iOS app on iOS.\nThis is good news. It\u2019s good for Google\u2019s developers, who no longer have to build that custom code. And more importantly, it\u2019s good for people who use Google\u2019s apps on iOS, because with any luck they\u2019ll be updated faster, work better, and feel more like proper iOS apps, not invaders from some other platform.\n[Via Steven Troughton-Smith.]\n\u2014Linked by Jason Snell",

        "title": "iPhone SE 3 Rumored to Feature iPhone XR Design With Touch ID and Be Apple's Last LCD Smartphone",
        "body": "Apple's third-generation iPhone SE will feature an iPhone XR-like design with Touch ID and be the company's last \u200ciPhone\u200c with an LCD display, according to Chinese site MyDrivers.\nA machine translation of the report explains that the design of the third-generation \u200ciPhone SE\u200c is based on the \u200ciPhone\u200c XR, and will feature a \u200cTouch ID\u200c fingerprint scanner built into the side button, as well as an LCD display, the A15 Bionic chip, and 5G connectivity. The report noted that the device is expected to be Apple's final \u200ciPhone\u200c with an LCD display, with future iPhones moving to OLED or other, more advanced display technologies.\nMyDrivers acknowledged that this assertion stands in contrast to other recent claims that the third-generation \u200ciPhone SE\u200c would continue with the design of the current, second-generation model, but was insistent that it is correct. The \u200ciPhone SE\u200c currently shares the same design as the now-discontinued \u200ciPhone\u200c 8, with a \u200cTouch ID\u200c scanner built into the Home Button.\nRumors around the design of the next \u200ciPhone SE\u200c have been muddled, with rumors from reliable sources such as Ming-Chi Kuo and Ross Young initially saying that the device would feature a 6.1-inch display like the \u200ciPhone\u200c XR, but with a Touch ID side button. This year, Kuo and Young withdrew these expectations, saying that the third-generation \u200ciPhone SE\u200c would instead have the same design as the current model with a Home Button.\nSome of the confusion around the \u200ciPhone SE\u200c may be explained by the 6.1-inch model potentially being the fourth-generation \u200ciPhone SE\u200c. Young now expects a fourth-generation \u200ciPhone SE\u200c to launch in 2023, featuring a 6.1-inch display and a hole-punch front-facing camera.\nMyDrivers said that the third-generation \u200ciPhone SE\u200c will reportedly launch in the spring of 2022, and start with 64GB of storage and the same $399 starting price of the current model.\nMyDrivers has a mixed track record. Although the site erroneously suggested that the \u200ciPhone\u200c 7 Plus would actually be called the \"iPhone Pro\" and the fourth-generation iPad Air would launch in March 2021, it correctly predicted that the \u200ciPhone\u200c 7 would be available with up to 256GB of storage, that third-generation iPad Pro would contain a 7nm chip with eight cores, and that the fourth-generation iPad Air would feature a larger display, the A14 Bionic chip, a Smart Connector with Magic Keyboard support, a USB-C port, and stereo speakers.",

        "body": "Apple today released new firmware updates for the second-generation AirPods, the AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max. All three of the AirPod models are now running 4A400 firmware, up from 3E751 for the standard AirPods, 3E756 for the \u200cAirPods Max\u200c, and 3E751 for the \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c.\nApple has also released new 4A394 firmware for the Beats Solo Pro, Powerbeats 4, and Powerbeats Pro.\nApple does not offer information on what's included in refreshed firmware for the \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c, so we don't know what improvements or bug fixes the new firmware brings. The update likely adds Conversation Boost to the \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c.\nConversation Boost is an iOS 15 feature that uses the beamforming microphones in the \u200c\u200cAirPods Pro\u200c\u200c to boost the volume level of conversations, which is ideal for those with mild to moderate hearing challenges.\nThere's no standard way to upgrade the \u200cAirPods\u200c\u200c software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the \u200c\u200cAirPods\u200c\u200c are connected to an iOS device.

        "title": "Apple Says Notch is a 'Smart Way' to Give Users More Space for Content on New MacBook Pros",
        "body": "The notch on the newly redesigned MacBook Pro offers a \"smart way\" to give users more room for their content and allowed Apple to make the bezels thinner and provide more screen real estate to customers, an Apple official has said during a recent media interview.\nThe inclusion of a notch on the entirely revamped MacBook Pros was a surprise and was one of the few last-minute rumors that surfaced ahead of Apple's \"Unleashed\" event last week. As expected, some social media users have criticized Apple's design choice of adding a notch to the display.\nAddressing the company's decision, Shruti Haldea, a manager for the Mac product line and one of the presenters of last week's Apple event, said during an interview on the Same Brain podcast that the notch is a \"smart\" solution for the Mac as it provides users more room for their content by moving the macOS menu bar out of the way.\nWhat we've done is we've actually made the display taller. Like on the 16-inch notebook, you still have a 16.0 active area on the diagonal in that 16:10-inch window, and we just grew the display up from there and put the menu bar up there. We just kind of moved it up and out of the way. So it's a really smart way to give you more space for your content, and when you're in full-screen mode, you have that 16:10 window, and it looks great. It's seamless.\nCompared to previous iterations of the MacBook Pro design, the new 14-inch and 16-inch models do feature significantly smaller bezels. Apple says the bezels are 24% thinner than the previous generation on the left and right sides of the display, measuring only 3.5mm. On the top, thanks to the notch, the bezel is 60% thinner, also measuring at 3.5mm.\nWhile the notch is noticeable at first, Apple is betting on some macOS software features, including dark mode, to help minimize how noticeable it is to some users in day-to-day use. For example, when macOS apps are in full-screen mode, the system adds a black border to the top of the display, hiding the notch while not interfering with a user's content. Developers can choose to have their app's content shown on either side of the notch.\nThe notch is one many changes to the new MacBook Pros. The new laptops feature an entirely redesigned chassis, additional ports such as HDMI and an SD card slot, MagSafe, a mini-LED display with ProMotion, and either the M1 Pro or M1 Max chips, which are the first Apple silicon chips designed for professional consumers.\nBoth the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models became available for pre-order last week and will start arriving to customers on Tuesday, October 26. Both sizes can be configured with either the \u200cM1 Pro\u200c or \u200cM1 Max\u200c chips, giving users substantial performance gains compared to the M1 Apple silicon chip.

        "title": "iFixit: New MacBook Pro has first 'DIY-friendly' battery replacement design since 2012",
        "body": "Following yesterday\u2019s release of the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, the folks at iFixit have shared an early look at their teardown of the new machines. In a teaser posted today, iFixit says that the new MacBook Pro has the \u201cfirst reasonably DIY-friendly battery replacement procedure since 2012.\u201d\niFixit explains that Apple began gluing the MacBook Pro\u2019s battery to the top case of the device with the introduction of the first Retina MacBook Pro in 2012. This year, however, Apple has at least partially reversed this decision with new \u201cbattery pull tabs.\u201d\nNormally we get to the battery last because, well, they suck to remove. But as we peer into the guts, we notice something we haven\u2019t seen in a long time in a MacBook Pro, three words that make our hair stand on end: battery pull tabs. Even better, it appears the battery isn\u2019t trapped under the logic board. That could mean battery swaps without removing all the brains first\u2014a procedure we\u2019ve been dreaming about for a while. The four outer battery cells have easily-noticeable pull tabs, which are the typical thin white strips we know and love from the iPhone and MacBook Air. But wait, we don\u2019t see any pull tabs on the middle cells. Are we screwed\u2014or, worse, glued? Not entirely! We removed the trackpad and, lo and behold, there are cut-outs to access the pull tabs that hold the middle battery cells in place.\nWhile some more digging and testing will be required to know what exactly this means, iFixit says that the change means the new MacBook Pro has the first battery design that is \u201creasonable\u201d for do-it-yourself replacements since 2012.\niFixit promises that it will share more details from its MacBook Pro teardown over the coming days.",

        "body": "Back in October of 2020, Apple introduced a service program to address AirPods Pro issues that could cause them to experience static, crackling sounds, or problems with Active Noise Cancellation. At the time, Apple said the program would cover the \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c for two years after the retail sale of the unit.\nApple has now extended the program, quietly updating the accompanying support document back at the beginning of October. As noted on Reddit, the \"Additional Information\" section of the page now notes that the program will cover affected \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c for three years after the first retail sale of the unit, up from the initial two years.\nCustomers who purchased AirPods at launch in 2019 will now be covered until October 2022 should this issue pop up, and those who bought in 2020 before the repaired version in October 2020 came out can get repairs until 2023.\nFaulty \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c that are in need of repair exhibit the following problems:\nCrackling or static sounds that increase in loud environments, with exercise or while talking on the phone\nActive Noise Cancellation not working as expected, such as a loss of bass sound, or an increase in background sounds, such as street or airplane noise\nAffected AirPods were manufactured before October 2020, and those who have \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c experiencing issues can bring them to Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider for service free of charge. Apple says that the \u200c\u200cAirPods Pro\u200c\u200c will be examined prior to service to verify that they're eligible for the program. \u200c\u200cAirPods Pro\u200c\u200c earbuds demonstrating the issue (left, right, or both) will be replaced.\nThe program applies only to the \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c and not the AirPods or the AirPods Max.",

        "body": "In his latest edition of the Power On newsletter, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman talks about Apple\u2019s long-rumored mixed-reality device, which could finally launch as early as next year. This is not the first time Gurman has reported on this mixed reality device. Apple has been planning one for a few years now and it seems it\u2019s almost ready to be announced.\nHe writes:\nApple is planning to unleash its own pricey device with advanced chips, displays, sensor, and avatar-based features as early as next year.\nEarly this year, a report claimed that this new mixed reality device could cost at least $3,000, which corroborates what Gurman said of this device being pricey. As Apple is already blowing away its users with the new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, it\u2019s only a matter of time until the company can combine all these pieces together.\nIn his newsletter, Mark Gurman also discusses whether this new Apple headset will play games or just focus on augmented reality, as even the new Macs have one of the most powerful chips ever made, macOS isn\u2019t a great gaming platform and even though Apple Arcade keeps adding more games, Apple itself still can\u2019t compete with Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo.\nHere, Gurman says this headset will have \u201cboth AR and VR capabilities,\u201d and what Apple is aiming for is a \u201cmixed reality experience that can handle games in high-quality virtual reality.\u201d He writes:\nApple\u2019s first headset will be of the mixed reality variety. That means it will have both AR and VR capabilities. While gaming can be done in both environments, virtual reality is what you want for seriously high-performance games with top-tier graphics. For Apple\u2019s first headset, that\u2019s what it\u2019s shooting for: a mixed reality experience that can handle games in high-quality virtual reality with snappy chips and high-end displays.\nThen, by his last sentence, Gurman gives the best tidbit: \u201cYears down the road, you\u2019ll see a true AR-only headset.\u201d This corroborates with all the latest Tim Cook statements about his excitement about an augmented reality future.\nThe last time we wrote about Apple Glasses, this mixed-reality device, the company was testing a display panel with a massive pixel density of 3,000 dots per inch (dpi), as you can read more about it here.\nAre you excited about this possible new Apple mixed-reality device?
