        "title": "Apple Says \u201cWe Hear You Taylor Swift\u201d, Will Pay Artists During Free Trial",
        "body": "Apple\u2019s Eddy Cue has just announced that Apple Music will change its plan and pay royalties to artists even during its three-month free trial for users, following Taylor Swift\u2019s public complaint about the policy. She had planned to withhold her hit album \u20181989\u2019 from the service in protest.\nWe\u2019ve learned that Apple made this decision to change its policy today. It will be paying an undisclosed royalty rate on a per stream basis to artist for the whole time that users are on the free trial.\nApple had planned to offer users a three-month free trial of its upcoming streaming Apple Music service that launches June 30th. However, it had negotiated deals with the major labels to not pay rights holders royalties during these trials and instead pay a tiny bit more in royalty rates afterwards.\nNow in the wake of intense negative PR stemming from Swift\u2019s blog post that bashed the policy, including my post earlier today where I wrote \u201cApple is acting greedy\u201d and should pay up, the tech giant has recanted.\nThe move should help it improve the public perception of Apple Music and potentially pull in some artists that were boycotting the old payout structure. Those include artists managed by Beggars Group, which put out its own letter to Apple last week denouncing the royalty-free trial.\nIt\u2019s unclear what Swift and Beggars Group will do now that their demands have been met, though Swift did just tweet her thanks for everyone who supported her conviction, saying \u201cI am elated and relieved. Thank you for your words of support today. They listened to us.\u201d\nSwift previously pulled \u20181989\u2019 from Spotify citing philosophical disagreements with its \u201cfree\u201d ad-supported tier. Spotify also offers short free trials and extremely cheap $0.99 three-month trials. But a source with knowledge of Spotify\u2019s deal structure tells me it already pays artists royalties during all its trial periods. It\u2019s quite possible that both will pay artists at a lower rate during free trials than during normal subscriptions.\nWhile it might be nice to think of Swift as a champion for all musicians here, Bloomberg Businessweek did recently report that she was in talks for exclusives with Apple Music. Those seem to have never come to fruition, so it\u2019s a little suspicious that she\u2019s now swinging so far the other way.\nThis morning I argued for why Apple should invest in the future of Apple Music by being more generous with artists and paying royalties during its trials. Apparently Apple agrees on some level. Check out that article for more on why this change of heart is a smart move for Apple.\nEssentially:",

        "title": "A blow for mobile advertising: The next version of Safari will let users block ads on iPhones and iPads",
        "body": "It didn\u2019t get a mention in Apple\u2019s big keynote announcements Monday \u2014 which already had plenty of interest to publishers \u2014 but deep within Apple\u2019s developer documentation lies perhaps the most important item of all to the news industry.\nAdblocking is coming to the iPhone with iOS 9.\nAdblocking \u2014 running a piece of software in your web browser that prevents ads on most web pages from loading \u2014 has moved from a niche behavior for the nerdy few to something mainstream. A report from 2014 found that adblock usage was up 70 percent year-over-year, with over 140 million people blocking ads worldwide, including 41 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds. You can understand why that would be troubling to the publishers who sell those ads. But until now, adblocking has been limited almost entirely to desktop \u2014 mobile browsers haven\u2019t allowed it.\nHere\u2019s how the developer documentation puts the new change, coming in iOS 9:\nThe new Safari release brings Content Blocking Safari Extensions to iOS. Content Blocking gives your extensions a fast and efficient way to block cookies, images, resources, pop-ups, and other content. Your app extension is responsible for supplying a JSON file to Safari. The JSON consists of an array of rules (triggers and actions) for blocking specified content. Safari converts the JSON to bytecode, which it applies efficiently to all resource loads without leaking information about the user\u2019s browsing back to the app extension. Xcode includes a Content Blocker App Extension template that contains code to send your JSON file to Safari. Just edit the JSON file in the template to provide your own triggers and actions. The sample JSON file below contains triggers and actions that block images on webkit.org.\nWhat this means is, when iOS 9 launches in the fall, you\u2019ll be able to go to the App Store and download an extension that will block ads on most news sites.\nIs there any chance that won\u2019t be incredibly popular? The desktop version of Safari currently allows a variety of custom extensions, and what\u2019s the most popular? Hint: It\u2019s called AdBlock.\nFor me, the arguments for using ad blockers range from the unconvincing (dude, information wants to be free) to the reasonable (I don\u2019t need dozens of tracking beacons on every webpage) to the downright understandable (poorly built ads slow my browser to a crawl). I don\u2019t use an ad blocker, but I do block all Flash by default for performance reasons, which accomplishes some of the same ends. The best arguments for adblocking are even stronger on mobile than they are on desktop \u2014 bandwidth and performance and battery life are all at a premium.\nThis is worrisome. Publishers already make tiny dollars on mobile, even as their readers have shifted there in huge numbers. To take one example, The New York Times has more than 50 percent of its digital audience on mobile, but generates only 10 percent of its digital advertising revenue there. Most news outlets aren\u2019t even at that low level.\nIf iOS users \u2014 the majority of mobile web users in the U.S., and disproportionately appealing demographically \u2014 can suddenly block all your ads with a simple free download, where is the growth going to come from? (By the way, a version of Adblock Plus for Android just came out a couple weeks ago, though it appears to be more limited than what Apple is allowing.)\nThe folks behind Adblock Plus \u2014 a different ad blocker from AdBlock; it\u2019s a confusing space \u2014 aren\u2019t sure they like the way Apple\u2019s allowing it, saying it might make certain adblocking methods harder to implement on the desktop version of Safari. But desktop Safari is small potatoes compared to the web browser on every iPhone and every iPad, where it was impossible to write ad blockers before now.\nThe potential impact of \u201cContent Blocking Safari Extensions\u201d even goes beyond blocked ads. Apple is explicitly allowing the blocking of cookies on a site-by-site basis. For example, you could build an extension that blocked the cookies that allow a newspaper paywall to work. The Yourtown Times allows you 10 stories free a month? It\u2019s probably using a cookie to keep track of that count. Block that cookie and the paywall comes tumbling down \u2014 you\u2019re a fresh visitor every time. Imagine being able to download an extension that blocked paywall cookies on the top 50 paid news sites. It wouldn\u2019t even be particularly hard to code; unless Apple chooses to prevent it, someone will do it. News sites would be able to build workarounds \u2014 changing cookie IDs regularly, requiring user login from article 1 \u2014 but winning that sort of cat-and-mouse game is something publishers are unlikely to be good at.\nWhy would Apple do this?\nAn Apple partisan might argue it just wants to give users control of their iPhone experience, and having debuted extensions in the last version of iOS, allowing them to alter web content is a natural next step.\nAn Apple realist might argue that its great rival Google makes more than 90 percent of its revenue from online advertising \u2014 a growing share of that on mobile, and a large share of that on iPhone. Indeed, Google alone makes about half of all global mobile advertising revenue. So anything that cuts back on mobile advertising revenue is primarily hurting its rival. (Google has been less friendly to adblockers than its \u201copen\u201d positioning would suggest.)\nAn Apple cynic might note that the company on Monday unveiled its new News app, which promises a beautiful reading experience \u2014 and a monetization model based on Apple\u2019s iAds. iAds will, one can assume, never be blockable by third-party extensions available in the App Store. Ads that appear at the operating system level \u2014 as opposed to in HTML and JavaScript on a web page \u2014 have a rather invulnerable position so long as you keep using Apple products. (It\u2019s good to be the platform.)\nMaybe I\u2019m exaggerating the potential impact here. (Talk me down!) Maybe people won\u2019t download the free app at the top of the Most Downloaded list that promises to make their websites load more quickly, more beautifully, and using less data. But use of ad blockers has done nothing but rise, particularly among young users, and people are about to be given an easy way to do on the devices they use most. For the many news companies who are counting on mobile advertising for their future business model, I don\u2019t see a way that this change won\u2019t shave off a real slice of mobile advertising revenue.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nWhistleblower and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden lauded Apple for enabling measures like default full-disk encryption in iOS 8, in a rare editorial published on Friday.\nThe piece for The New York Times noted that some progress has been made in reversing mass surveillance not just politically but technologically, through changes to devices and Internet protocols. Various governments, including the U.S., have been using weaknesses in high-tech infrastructure to spy on the public, but these are allegedly being closed.\n\"Basic technical safeguards such as encryption \u2014 once considered esoteric and unnecessary \u2014 are now enabled by default in the products of pioneering companies like Apple, ensuring that even if your phone is stolen, your private life remains private,\" Snowden said.\nApple has come under fire from various U.S. government officials for iOS 8's security. The most infamous example may be Deputy Attorney General James Cole, who in October 2014 claimed that Apple was marketing to criminals, and that its technology would one day lead to the death of a child, since police would not be able to extract needed iPhone data.\niOS 8 not only encrypts iPhone and iPad data by default, but gives Apple no access to encryption keys, meaning that the company can't help produce someone's data even when served with a warrant or pressured by intelligence agencies.\nIn March, a document leaked by Snowden revealed a Central Intelligence Agency campaign to crack the security of iOS, OS X, BitLocker, and other platforms. Although it's unclear to what extent the CIA and NSA may have broken through iOS 8, past versions of iOS have been vulnerable to spying tools.",

        "title": "Google finally makes Chrome for Mac usable -- makes it more resource efficient, now much lighter on battery consumption",
        "body": "It\u2019s no secret that Chrome for Mac hogs more resources than Safari. The browser by Google has been receiving heat from experts and users alike for shortening their laptop's battery life by 2-3 hours. The good news is that the company finally seems committed to resolving these glitches.\nEarlier this month the Mountain View-based giant took its first major step at bringing improvements to its browser when it announced that Chrome will begin to automatically pause flash content on web-pages if a user hasn\u2019t looked at it in a while. The company is now sharing other efforts it is making to improve Chrome.\nPeter Kasting, a Chrome developer notes on a Google+ post that the company has been working to make the browser more battery efficient on OS X. In the post, Kasting reveals the changes his team has recently pushed to reduce resource usage and improve the battery life.\nFor instance, Chrome will no longer assign a high priority to background tabs (the ones you haven\u2019t looked at in a while). \"Renderers for background tabs get a lower priority, reducing idle wakeups on various perf test, in some cases by significant amounts (e.g. 50 percent on one test)\", he notes.\nAmong other improvements, Kasting says the team has managed to reduce the CPU usage by toning down the frequency at which Chrome pings the processor. \"On a Google search results page, using Safari's user agent to get the same content that Safari would, Chrome incurs ~390 wakes over 30s and 0.3 percent CPU usage vs. Safari\u2019s 120 wakes over 30s and 0.1 percent CPU usage. Now: 66 percent reduction in both timer firings and CPU use. Chrome is now incurring ~120 wakes over 30s and 0.1 percent CPU use, on par with Safari\". The improvements are visible while visiting other websites as well, he notes.\nThe Chrome team at Google has been hard at work these past few months. The company recently did an AMA on Reddit in which it revealed that it was working to make the Android client of its browser more battery efficient. While the AMA was largely centered around developments made to Chrome for Android, a Google representative told me at the time that the company was working on reducing memory usage in the desktop client as well.\nPhoto credit: Shmizla / Shutterstock",

        "body": "The next laptop you buy with a USB Type-C port could be even more useful than you thought. Intel today unveiled Thunderbolt 3, which uses an identical port design as its USB brethren. So if Apple sticks with its new MacBook design, for instance, it could adopt the port and enable both Thunderbolt and USB Type-C without any adapters. It's a step toward simplifying the messy sea of ports often found on laptops and PCs, and could make Thunderbolt accessible to a larger group of people than before. Thunderbolt 3 offers more than just port convenience, however. It'll support a 40 Gbps connection over Thunderbolt, which is double the speed of Thunderbolt 2, 10 Gbps USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2.\nIt's not the first time that Thunderbolt has piggy-backed on another port design -- the original incarnation used Mini DisplayPort. With its nipper data speeds, the new Thunderbolt 3 can support dual 4K 60 Hz displays, in addition to blazingly fast file transfers. You'll also be able to use the port for regular USB work, which should come in handy when connecting older accessories. It won't be long before the new standard comes into effect either -- Intel says the first Thunderbolt 3 products should ship later this year.",

        "title": "Taylor Swift Criticizes Apple Music's Free Trial in Open Letter",
        "body": "A couple days ago BuzzFeed reported that Taylor Swift's new album, \"1989\", would not be available to stream on Apple Music, denying the service of one of the best-selling albums of the last two years. Today, Swift penned an open letter to the Cupertino company explaining her decision.\nI\u2019m sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service. I\u2019m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company.\nSwift, who calls Apple one of her best partners in selling her music, says that while she is able to take care of herself and her band, crew and management with money from live shows, indie artists do not have the same luxury. She explains that her sentiments about the three-month free trial are echoed by \"every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much.\"\nShe goes on to say that she understands Apple is working toward a goal of paid streaming and that Apple Music could be the first streaming service that \"gets it right\" in her eyes in regards to artist compensation. However, she also points out that Apple is \"astronomically successful\" and could afford to pay artists, writers and producers during the three-month free trial. She closes the open letter asking Apple to reconsider its policy.\nBut I say to Apple with all due respect, it\u2019s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don\u2019t ask you for free iPhones. Please don\u2019t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.\nThis isn't the first time Apple has received criticism for not paying labels and artists royalties during the 3-month free trial. Last week, indie labels from the United Kingdom who housed artists like Adele argued that the trial period would \"put people out of business\". Singer-songwriter Anton Newcombe also spoke out about the policy, claiming the Cupertino company threatened to ban his music from iTunes if he did not accept no royalties during the 3-month free trial. Apple denied the claim.\nApple Music will launch in just under 10 days, going live on June 30 as part of an upcoming iOS 8.4 update. After the service's free three-month trial it will cost $9.99 per month for individuals and $14.99 a month for families up to 6.",

        "title": "Fueled by Snowden and Apple, private search engine DuckDuckGo rapidly grows",
        "body": "The privacy-minded search engine DuckDuckGo announced this week that it has reached a milestone . The Google alternative now serves over 10 million searches per day. (By comparison, Google serves about 4.3 billion per day .)\nBack in May 2012 when Ars profiled the startup, we reported that DuckDuckGo hit an all-time record of 1.5 million searches per day. At that time, its daily search traffic had grown by 227 percent in three months. In the three years since, DuckDuckGo has continued to grow as more Internet users have become increasingly privacy-conscious online. DuckDuckGo's traffic jumped noticeably after the Snowden revelations in June 2013, and it continued to rise after being included in the OS X Yosemite and iOS 8 versions of Safari nearly a year later. Mozilla also added it as an option to Firefox late last year.\nDuckDuckGo works by using both its own Web crawler and data from other search engines, including Yahoo, Bing, and Blekko\u2014not Google. The company claims that it does not log IP addresses or user agents, and it says that \u201cno cookies are used by default.\" It also uses default encryption modeled after HTTPS Everywhere.\nOn Twitter, founder Gabriel Weinberg announced the news of this recent daily search milestone:\nBest birthday present ever, softening the blow that I'm now 36. Thank you to everyone who has helped us get here. https://t.co/Z7I2DjZaix \u2014 Gabriel Weinberg (@yegg) June 23, 2015\nWeinberg told Ars on Thursday that in recent years, DuckDuckGo's rise with Apple and Mozilla took time. \"I think before last year we were too tiny to be taken seriously by bigger companies, but now we're at a size where people take notice,\" he said. \"We want to get as big as we can because we think we're giving people a great experience and we'd love people to use us, but we're sustainable now. So do we have to get bigger or we're going to go away? No\u2014we like our existence.\"",

        "title": "Today's worst tech idea: the Wall Street Journal says Apple should kill the Mac",
        "body": "I have no doubt that Chris Mims's Wall Street Journal article making the case against the Mac will attract clicks from throngs of angry Apple fans. But however brilliant the piece might be as an exercise in trolling, Mims's arguments for Apple to cancel its most venerable product line don't really hold water.\nThe Mac is a popular, profitable, and prestigious product. It's usually a bad idea for a company to cancel a product like that, and this case is no exception.\n1) Lots of companies make more than 3 great products\n\"The world\u2019s best tech companies can be the best at two things at once, maybe three,\" Mims writes. He then chooses the worst possible example to illustrate his point: \"Google Inc. is search, Android and ad platforms, plus a long tail of commitments that sometimes feel like someone\u2019s pet project.\"\nThose \"pet projects\" include the world's most popular video-sharing service, the world's most popular web browser, and an extremely popular email service. They also include Google Docs, Google Maps, and Google Calendar. Google Maps isn't as profitable as Google's search engine, but it would be insane for Google to shut it down because it's only Google's fifth most successful product and Larry Page needs to focus more on the top three.\n2) Maintaining old product lines is relatively easy\nIf Apple didn't have a PC business, it probably wouldn't make sense for the company to try to create one from scratch. But the Mac is highly profitable, and it should continue generating profits for the foreseeable future with minimal oversight from Apple CEO Tim Cook.\nIt's a mistake to conclude that the Mac platform is unimportant\nIndeed, while Apple hasn't killed off the Mac, it has taken Mims's advice to a limited extent: the pace of Mac innovation slowed noticeably around 2007, when Apple introduced the iPhone. That's because Apple pulled many of its best engineers off of Mac projects to work on iPhone-related ones instead.\nSo there's no reason to think that continuing to sell Macs is particularly distracting. A company might only be able to focus on a few products at a time, but it can easily have others that are running on autopilot.\n3) PCs aren't obsolete\nMims dismissively describes Macs as \"a last-century technology.\" Because mobile OSes are newer and there's more activity around them right now, a lot of people have made the mistake of thinking this means desktop and laptop computers are obsolete products. But that's a misunderstanding of what's going on.\nThe best way to see this is to observe that most of the world's internet servers run on Unix-based operating systems such as Linux. Unix dates back to the early 1970s, and in some ways it seems horribly antiquated. Yet that doesn't mean people are going to start hosting websites on iPads soon. Rather, Linux works well for certain specialized tasks like running a web server, and it will continue to be used for that task for the foreseeable future.\nThe same point applies to Macs. They're extremely well-suited to certain kinds of computing tasks \u2014 creating a spreadsheet, editing an image or video, writing a computer program, playing a complex computer game, and so forth \u2014 that you can't easily do with an iPhone or iPad. There's no reason to think iPhones or iPads are going to become good ways to perform these relatively more complex tasks anytime soon. So people are going to continue to want to buy PCs (from Apple and other companies) for the foreseeable future.\nMoreover, if Apple didn't have Macs in its lineup, the company would be more tempted to add PC-like features to the iPad in an effort to appeal to more demanding users. That would be bad for iPad users, who value the product's simplicity and don't really need the capabilities of a full-blown PC.\n4) The Mac is a strategic asset for Apple\nApple sells a lot fewer Macs than it does iPhones, but it's a mistake to conclude from that that the Mac platform is unimportant. That's because Mac users are disproportionately important to Apple's broader business strategy.\nApple loves to create products that work seamlessly together\nThe most obvious example of this is that people use Macs to create iPhone apps. Controlling the Mac platform makes it easier for Apple to ensure that the process of developing iPhone apps is as good as possible, which will mean more iPhone apps get made.\nApple loves to create products that work seamlessly together. A recent innovation called Handoff, for example, allows users to continue a task such as a phone call from an iPhone to a Mac or vice versa. This kind of cross-platform innovation is a lot easier to do when a company owns both platforms.",

        "body": "You\u2019ve got to hand it to Samsung for its me-too, whatever-it-takes attitude it has when it comes to battling Apple\u2019s iPhone. The strategy has worked for quite some time, and Samsung still does it, no matter how blatant some of the rip-offs may be \u2013 but hey, nobody owns cool, and everybody copies everybody.\nBut the latest Apple stunt Samsung tried to rip off backfired in the most hilarious possible way.\nDON\u2019T MISS: My favorite iPhone 6 case \u2013 a sleek metal bumper \u2013 is now just $13 shipped from Amazon\nApple kicked off last week\u2019s WWDC keynote with a fun anecdote from Tim Cook, who showed off a ransom note Brandon Moss received from his friends so he could get the special 100th home run ball back. Cook showed the ball and said he would pay the ransom, which consisted mostly Apple products. Sure, you might suspect that this was a marketing ploy from Apple, considering the attention it got. Even if that\u2019s the case, kudos to Apple\u2019s PR team for thinking it up.\nBut, Samsung is suspected to have tried to use the same trick, as Look Insight reports, only a few days after Apple\u2019s big event.\nTrevor Bauer, a pitcher for the same Cleveland team, got a hold of another milestone ball \u2014 the first hit for rookie Francisco Lindor. He then sent out a tweet posting a ransom note filled with Samsung products.\n\u201cHey @Lindor12BC we have your ball. @indians Bullpen settled for @tim_cook Apple products but we want @samsungmobileus,\u201d he said\u2026 from an iPhone.\nOf course, this might be a coincidence, and all those people who think it\u2019s a Samsung PR ploy in here might be wrong. But then again, the simpler explanation would be that Samsung tried to mimic what Apple and tried to riff on it.\nAn image showing Bauer\u2019s requests \u2014 and a screenshot showing the device used to tweet that list \u2014 follow below.\nlindor-samsung-ransom-ball\nlindor-samsung-ransom-ball-bauer-iphone-tweet\nRelated stories\nMy favorite iPhone 6 case - a sleek metal bumper - is now just $13 shipped from Amazon\n9 awesome paid iPhone apps on sale for free for a limited time\nStory continues\nApple Stores finally begin selling Apple Watch starting today\nMore from BGR: 9 awesome paid iPhone apps on sale for free for a limited time\nThis article was originally published on BGR.com",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Tim Cook Delivers Blistering Speech On Encryption, Privacy",
        "body": "Yesterday evening, Apple CEO Tim Cook was honored for \u2018corporate leadership\u2019 during EPIC\u2019s Champions of Freedom event in Washington. Cook spoke remotely to the assembled audience on guarding customer privacy, ensuring security and protecting their right to encryption.\n\u201cLike many of you, we at Apple reject the idea that our customers should have to make tradeoffs between privacy and security,\u201d Cook opened. \u201cWe can, and we must provide both in equal measure. We believe that people have a fundamental right to privacy. The American people demand it, the constitution demands it, morality demands it.\u201d\nThis marked the first time that EPIC, a nonprofit research center in Washington focused on emerging privacy and civil liberties issues, has given the honor to a person from the business world. The hosts of the event included cryptographer Bruce Schneier, EPIC president Marc Rotenberg, Lobbyist Hilary Rosen and Stanford Lecturer in Law Chip Pitts.\nCook was characteristically passionate about all three topics. A theme that has persisted following his appearance on Charlie Rose late last year to define how Apple handled encryption, his public letter on Apple\u2019s new security page in the wake of the celebrity nude hacking incidents and his speech earlier this year at President Obama\u2019s Summit on Cybersecurity at Stanford \u2014 an event which was notably not attended by other Silicon Valley CEOs like Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Yahoo\u2019s Marissa Mayer and Google\u2019s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt.\nCook lost no time in directing comments at companies (obviously, though not explicitly) like Facebook and Google, which rely on advertising to users based on the data they collect from them for a portion, if not a majority, of their income.\n\u201cI\u2019m speaking to you from Silicon Valley, where some of the most prominent and successful companies have built their businesses by lulling their customers into complacency about their personal information,\u201d said Cook. \u201cThey\u2019re gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it. We think that\u2019s wrong. And it\u2019s not the kind of company that Apple wants to be.\u201d\nCook went on to state, as he has before when talking about products like Apple Pay, that Apple \u2018doesn\u2019t want your data.\u2019\nThey\u2019re gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it. We think that\u2019s wrong. Tim Cook\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think you should ever have to trade it for a service you think is free but actually comes at a very high cost. This is especially true now that we\u2019re storing data about our health, our finances and our homes on our devices,\u201d Cook went on, getting even more explicit when talking about user privacy.\n\u201cWe believe the customer should be in control of their own information. You might like these so-called free services, but we don\u2019t think they\u2019re worth having your email, your search history and now even your family photos data mined and sold off for god knows what advertising purpose. And we think some day, customers will see this for what it is.\u201d\nThat, in case you missed it, is an epic subtweet of Google\u2019s Photos product, which was just rolled out at I/O.The fact that Photos is free of charge, and Apple\u2019s products are not likely spurred the talk about \u201cvery high costs.\u201d\nThat product uploads all of your photos, with unlimited storage, to Google\u2019s cloud, organizing, improving and giving you access to a deep history of your images. By many accounts, Photos is a fantastic product, but even early on people have begun to point out the obvious tradeoff that you\u2019re making when you sign up.\nEncryption\nCook then switched gears to talk about encryption \u2014 directly addressing the efforts by policy makers to force Apple to offer a \u2018master key\u2019 that would allow government agencies access to consumer devices.\n\u201cThere\u2019s another attack on our civil liberties that we see heating up every day \u2014 it\u2019s the battle over encryption. Some in Washington are hoping to undermine the ability of ordinary citizens to encrypt their data,\u201d said Cook.\n\u201cWe think this is incredibly dangerous. We\u2019ve been offering encryption tools in our products for years, and we\u2019re going to stay on that path. We think it\u2019s a critical feature for our customers who want to keep their data secure. For years we\u2019ve offered encryption services like iMessage and FaceTime because we believe the contents of your text messages and your video chats is none of our business.\u201d\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security has been waging a war on \u201cpervasive encryption,\u201d painting it as an enabler of terrorism. Every security researcher and logical human being on the planet understands that this is ridiculous. And Cook is one of them.\n\u201cIf you put a key under the mat for the cops, a burglar can find it, too. Criminals are using every technology tool at their disposal to hack into people\u2019s accounts. If they know there\u2019s a key hidden somewhere, they won\u2019t stop until they find it,\u201d Cook continued.\n\u201cRemoving encryption tools from our products altogether, as some in Washington would like us to do, would only hurt law-abiding citizens who rely on us to protect their data. The bad guys will still encrypt; it\u2019s easy to do and readily available.\u201d\nCook then took it a step further, noting that weakening encryption could have a \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on our First Amendment rights.\nThe bad guys will still encrypt; it\u2019s easy to do and readily available. Tim Cook\n\u201cNow, we have a deep respect for law enforcement, and we work together with them in many areas, but on this issue we disagree. So let me be crystal clear \u2014 weakening encryption, or taking it away, harms good people that are using it for the right reasons. And ultimately, I believe it has a chilling effect on our First Amendment rights and undermines our country\u2019s founding principles.\u201d\nCook said that Apple designs its products to \u201ccollect the minimum amount of data necessary to create great experiences.\u201d\nIt could be argued that it doesn\u2019t gather enough, as Google Now, Google on Tap and other holistic offerings have the potential to give users much more lateral movement and \u2018delight\u2019 moments on Android specifically due to how much data Google gathers on its users. And Google has its own safeguards in place including anonymizing data (stripping out personal information). But that is the fundamental tradeoff that Apple is willing to make, says Cook.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just grab everything, so we\u2019re not the richest target for those who want access to that kind of data. And for encryption \u2014 well we\u2019re continuing to do the right thing, and we are moving forward. In an era where our information is digital, portable and sought-after more than ever, we want to build products that keep people\u2019s information safe.\u201d\nCook then laid out an Abraham Lincoln quote (which I vetted, it\u2019s true): \u201cAmerica will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t ask our customers to make a tradeoff between privacy and security. We need to offer them the best of both,\u201d Cook wrapped up. \u201cUltimately, protecting someone else\u2019s data protects all of us.\u201d\nSales And Truth\nIt\u2019s a masterful stroke of speechifying. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, by taking this stance (which I do not believe to be disingenuous, their profit centers support it), Apple has put all other cloud companies in the unfortunate position of digging themselves out of a moral communications hole to prove their altruism when it comes to user data.\nI\u2019m not saying that Cook is correct in brutalizing the motives of companies like Google or Facebook \u2014 but it does craft a strong portrait \u2014 because Apple is safer and \u2018not interested\u2019 in your data casts a cloud (ahem) of doubt over pretty much every other company in its league.\nI\u2019m honestly surprised that it took this long for Apple to begin leveraging this particular \u2018fine print\u2019 point of how it does business. Part of it can be chalked up to its overall reluctance to be transparent about security issues \u2014 which it has handily reversed itself on over the past nine months. Still no public bug bounty, though, which would be sweet.\nApple is a corporation that makes money off of its customers. In that, it\u2019s identical to any other tech giant and should be regarded with a healthy critical eye and skepticism, period. Though Apple has achieved massive scale, there is always the threat that an alternate model like Facebook\u2019s or Google\u2019s will undermine their profit centers.\nThe way in which it makes its money, then, is Apple\u2019s new north star sales tool. And, like all the best marketing, it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s based in a fundamental truth: we could all be selling our \u2018selves\u2019 for a sale price.",

        "body": "Last week, above. Today, below.\nThe original iPad mini has quietly disappeared from Apple\u2019s web site, and is no longer available to purchase new from the Apple Store. Introduced in October 2012, the first iPad mini established the industrial design that was subsequently used in the iPad mini 2 and iPad mini 3, as well as the larger but otherwise nearly identical iPad Air and iPad Air 2. Apple notably continued to sell the 16GB iPad mini as an entry-level model alongside two of its sequels, dropping its price to $299 in October 2013, then $249 in October 2014. In recent months, falling street prices for other models made the classic mini a tougher sell.\nApple\u2019s discontinuation of the iPad mini leaves the remaining iPads as a completely 64-bit family, all using either A7 or A8X processors rather than the iPad mini\u2019s aging A5. It also means that all remaining iPads have Retina displays and unified Wi-Fi + Cellular models. Refurbished iPad minis continue to be available from the Apple Store, and start at $209; new iPad minis will continue to be available at third-party resellers such as Amazon until they run out of stock.\nPer 9to5Toys, Groupon currently has original iPads for $180 \u2018New\u2019 and Walmart offers them at a $50 discount over yesterday\u2019s price. Meanwhile Best Buy\u2019s CowBoom has used models for $115.\nThanks Michiel!",

        "body": "Taylor Swift has decided to stream her most recent best-selling album \"1989\" on Apple Music when the music service launches on June 30 next week, just days after Apple reversed course and agreed to pay artists and rights holders on a per-stream basis during the free three-month trial period -- specifically, Apple will pay 0.2 cents for each song streamed during a customer's trial.\nSwift says that she has not reached an exclusive deal with Apple Music like Pharrell Williams has for his upcoming single \"Freedom\" previewed at WWDC, noting that her decision was purely because it was \"the first time it's felt right\" for her to stream her album. \"1989\" and other Swift albums remain unavailable to stream through rival service and market leader Spotify.\nAfter the events of this week, I've decided to put 1989 on Apple Music...and happily so. \u2014 Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) June 25, 2015 In case you're wondering if this is some exclusive deal like you've seen Apple do with other artists, it's not. \u2014 Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) June 25, 2015 This is simply the first time it's felt right in my gut to stream my album. Thank you, Apple, for your change of heart. \u2014 Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) June 25, 2015\nSwift originally vowed not to stream \"1989\" through Apple Music because of Apple's plans to not pay artists during the free trial period, although the iPhone maker quickly changed its mind after the pop artist published an open letter on her Tumblr blog that criticized the move on behalf of all indie artists. \"We don\u2019t ask you for free iPhones. Please don\u2019t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation,\" wrote Swift.\nSince changing course, Apple Music has signed over 20,000 indie labels through deals with licensing groups Beggars Group and Merlin earlier this week, and reversed a PR disaster in the process. \"We think Apple Music provides artists with a business model that\u2019s good for the long term and we look forward to its launch on June 30,\" said the music groups after reaching an agreement with Apple.\nApple Music was announced earlier this month as an all-in-one streaming music service, live global radio station and social platform for artists to connect with fans. The subscription-based service will be available for $9.99 per month after a three-month free trial for iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and PC. Apple TV and Android versions of the service will be available in the fall.",

        "title": "Uh-Oh: Beats Teardown Apparently Used Beats Knockoffs",
        "body": "Many of you took an interest in the Beats teardown post from earlier this week, and we learned a lot about metal being added to a variety of product designs (thanks commenters!). However, a few sharp-eyed readers contacted us with disturbing allegations: Those weren't actual Beats headphones at all, they claimed.\nEnter a caption (optional)\nI couldn't get anyone to go on the record, which is a shame, as I would've loved for this information to be directly attributable to a Core77 reader. But here's what we were able to find out externally:\nThe prototype engineer who did the breakdown, Avery Louie, never mentions what model of Beats he tore down. But he refers to the price as $199, which is consistent with Beats' Solo 2 headphones. However, the color scheme in Louie's photos doesn't match the Solo 2 offerings, indicating he used Beats' discontinued Solo HD, which also retailed for $199. And here's where it starts to unravel.\nEnter a caption (optional)\nLouie found just two drivers, one per ear, in his teardown. But the Solo HD contains four drivers, two per ear. So it appears Louie's been given a bogus pair. Audiophile Redditor Vantt1 has gone to the trouble of highlighting some internal differences between real and fake Beats in this Imgur page, which shows a crossover circuit absent in the teardown and other discrepancies.\nThe question you likely have is, how could a prototype engineer be fooled into using knockoffs rather than the real deal? We'll remind you that he's tearing down products precisely because he doesn't know what's inside. One could also argue, however, that he should have been looking for dual drivers if he was familiar with the product description.\nWhere we can't fault Louie is in supposing these were real Beats products based on the packaging and external appearance. Pirate manufacturers have become so adept at aesthetic duplication that it is shocking. Don't believe us? Take a look at this video, where the TechBreak channel looks at real-vs.-fake Beats Solo 2 headphones side by side:\nEnter a caption (optional)\nImagine that this arrived via delivery and you're examining the packaging. It is nearly dead-on identical. The only giveaway is the extra languages printed on the box (which the reviewer refers to collectively as \"Chinese,\" but which is in fact Chinese, followed by Japanese, followed by Korean characters, followed by simplified Chinese). The real Beats packaging features only Western languages. However, unless you had both the real and fake boxes right next to each other, this would be unlikely to raise a red flag; it's common these days for lots of products to feature Asian languages on the box.\nEnter a caption (optional)\nEnter a caption (optional)\nOpening the box, there are a couple of additional giveaways\u2014the plastic wrapping on the fakes and the color of the serial numbers\u2014but again, unless you already had a real pair to compare it to and knew precisely what to look for, you wouldn't realize these were indications of fakery. And even with the real and fake side by side and no idea of what to look for, a layperson would be hard-pressed indeed to spot even minor differences.\nEnter a caption (optional)\nEnter a caption (optional)\nThe Solo 2 is Beats' lower-priced offering. Their Pro model is billed as their top-of-the-line and comes with a hefty $399.95 price tag. These, too, are being knocked off\u2014and again, you'll be astonished at how far the pirates have taken it:\nEnter a caption (optional)\nThis is very troubling, and a much larger issue than whether manufacturers are trying to \"fool\" consumers with metal or not. It makes me wonder how pervasive the fakes are, and also makes me wonder if consumers will now question the numerous reviews stating Beats' sound quality is inferior; did the reviewer purchase a real pair in the store, or through the mail? Obviously if you buy a new pair of Beats for $10 on eBay, something's up; but if the fakes have infiltrated an Amazon seller and priced them closer to the real thing, it's possible your average reviewer could have unknowingly attained knock-offs. This doubt can muddy the decision-making process of a potential end user, and I think that's bad news.\nHowever, I also sadly realize that none of this may matter. Whether you're wearing a good-sounding authentic pair of beats, a truly bad-sounding authentic pair of Beats or a worse-sounding pair of convincing knock-offs may actually make no difference; it depends on what your goal is in purchasing a particular product. In the video below, tech reviewer Marques Brownlee articulates what some commenters in the original post hinted at, about why some folks will purchase Beats regardless of reviews.",

        "body": "Code found in the first iOS 9 developer betas reveals that Apple is planning to support some significant camera features and upgrades with the new software version. Presumably planned for the next iPhone hardware version, developer Hamza Sood has discovered code in iOS 9 that reveals support for long-awaited changes to the front-facing FaceTime camera. According to the code, iOS 9 adds support for a FaceTime camera with 1080p video capture, up from the current 720p camera on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus\u2026 Code in iOS 9 also hints at support for capturing 240fps video at 720p using the front facing FaceTime camera, Sood notes. Other additions to iOS 9 discovered in the code include support for a front-facing camera flash \u2014 something Apple hasn\u2019t included on any previous iPhone \u2014 and the ability to capture panoramic selfie photos using the front camera.\nCurrently, Apple reserves many of these capabilities for the more powerful backside camera, although it\u2019s likely that Apple would plan feature improvements for the popular front facing camera on future iPhones. Major camera upgrades for the primary camera including a jump from 8MP to 12MP have been expected with this year\u2019s iPhone revision. Apple has also made recent acquisitions including LinX, which creates multi-sensor cameras that enhance low light photography without requiring large lenses.\nThe popularity of selfie apps and dedicated selfie sticks for taking single and group photos while being able to preview the image from the iPhone display certainly warrants attention given to improving the FaceTime camera. Bringing brand new features like front flash and existing features like panorama and slow-mo capture to the FaceTime camera should amount to a compelling upgrade for many iPhone users if the what the code suggests does ship this fall.\n[tweet https://twitter.com/hamzasood/status/608666970616160256]",

        "body": "Apple has decided to pull its planned WWDC new Apple TV hardware announcement, according to a new claim. Apple planned to debut the new box at the June 8th kickoff keynote before making the decision to scrap the hardware and SDK introduction in mid-May, according to the new report:\nThe company planned as recently as mid-May to use the event to spotlight new Apple TV hardware, along with an improved remote control and a tool kit for developers to make apps for the entertainment device. But those plans were postponed partly because the product was not ready for prime time, according to two people briefed on the product.\nWe\u2019ve reported that Apple has been planning a redesigned Apple TV box with app functionality, Siri voice search, and a new remote control for sometime, but it appears those won\u2019t be showcased until later, according to newspaper The New York Times. BuzzFeed and Re/code agree. Nor will Apple debut the SDK at this event. Perhaps the new hardware will be ready for display by the fall, when the TV subscription service is expected to be unveiled\u2026\nEarlier this week, reports surfaced claiming that Apple would also not introduce its subscription-based TV service at WWDC due to stalled talks with content providers. Besides the new Apple TV news, the report claims to have independently heard our reports that iOS 9 and OS X 10.11 will focus on quality and stability improvements, while also reiterating that the new Apple Music service will be showcased at the event.",

        "body": "Eight years ago today, the smartphone market changed forever. On June 29, 2007, Apple released the original iPhone with a sleek form factor and revolutionary multi-touch screen and significantly disrupted an industry then dominated by companies such as Nokia, BlackBerry, Sony and Motorola.\nThe original iPhone was exclusive to AT&T in the United States before launching in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Portugal, Ireland and Austria in November 2007. The 8GB model initially cost $599 on a two-year contract until Apple dropped the price to $399 in September 2007, far more expensive than today's starting price of $199.\nThe eighth anniversary of the original iPhone's release takes place just one day before the worldwide debut of Apple Music, another launch that could prove historic as Apple attempts to enter the crowded streaming music market alongside Spotify, Pandora, Google Play Music, YouTube and other players. Fittingly, many people will try Apple Music for the first time using an iPhone.\nApple has since sold hundreds of millions of iPhones around the world and launched ten models in eight years, ranging from the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. In the second quarter, the iPhone accounted for nearly 70% of Apple's revenue alongside the iPad, Mac, iTunes and other products and services.",

        "body": "Apple Music has signed two major indie music rights holders Beggars Group and Merlin Network, which represent over 20,000 indie labels and distributors, reports Billboard. The licensing agencies agreed to sign up for Apple Music after Apple changed course and agreed to pay artists on a per-stream basis during the streaming music service's three-month trial period.\nBritish singer Adele is signed to Beggars Group label XL Recordings (via DeviantArt\n\"I am pleased to say that Apple has made a decision to pay for all usage of Apple Music under the free trials on a per-play basis, as well as to modify a number of other terms that members had been communicating directly with Apple about,\" said Merlin CEO Charles Caldas. \"With these changes, we are happy to support the deal.\"\nBeggars Group is a British company that distributes labels 4AD, Rough Trade Records, Matador Records and XL Recordings among others, representing artists such as Adele, Arcade Fire and Radiohead, and helping along the careers of Basement Jaxx, M.I.A, The Prodigy and others. Merlin is an aggregator of several smaller labels that have represented music groups such as The xx.\nBillboard obtained a copy of the full Apple Music letter sent to Merlin Network members:\nDear Merlin Member I am pleased to say that Apple has made a decision to pay for all usage of Apple Music under the free trials on a per-play basis, as well as to modify a number of other terms that members had been communicating directly with Apple about. With these changes, we are happy to support the deal. As you know Merlin has not historically had a direct contract with Apple. Apple has direct deals with our members, and that continues to be the case. Therefore, the amendments referred to above will apply to your existing direct agreements, and the amended contract will shortly appear on iTunes Connect. However, Apple has indicated that in the future they are open to engaging with Merlin as a central point of communication and negotiation for our membership. Apple has a long standing, deep rooted relationship with the music community and has always helped ensure artists get paid for their work. We think Apple Music provides artists with a business model that\u2019s good for the long term and we look forward to its launch on June 30. We would remind you as ever that each member must make its own independent decisions in relation to Apple Music and its business in general.\nApple Music has also been endorsed by independent music advocate group Worldwide Independent Network (WIN), an agreement reached just hours after the Beggars Group and Merlin deals, according to Billboard. WIN was established in 2006 to address the business, creative and market access issues faced by indie artists and the larger independent music sector.",

Apple Music is both a streaming music service and 24-hour live radio station, in addition to a platform for artists to share lyrics, backstage photos, videos or latest songs for fans to comment on and share through social media.\nApple Music's streaming music service enables users to search and stream millions of songs from iTunes, with human curated playlists from music experts for improved personalization over algorithmically created playlists. Apple Music will be available for iPhone, iPad, Mac and PC on June 30, with support for Apple TV and Android coming in the fall.\nApple's new 24-hour global radio station called Beats 1 will be broadcast live in over 100 countries, headlined by former BBC radio DJ Zane Lowe alongside other famous DJs from Los Angeles, New York and London such as Ebro Darden and Julie Adenuga. Beats 1 will offer exclusive interviews, guest hosts and keep tabs on what is going on in the music world.\nApple Music Connect is the social platform built into Apple Music that allows users to connect with artists and share their favorite songs and albums through Facebook, Twitter, iMessage and email.

        "title": "Apple Pulls Seemingly All American Civil War Games",
        "body": "TouchArcade Rating:\nIf you\u2019ve been watching the news recently, you\u2019ll know of the huge debate in the U.S over the role of the Confederate flag in contemporary America. Many see it as a reminder of the many pre-Civil War injustices while others see it simply as a way to honor the soldiers who died for the Confederacy. Many large US companies, including Walmart and Amazon, have already banned the sale of any Confederate flag merchandise as a reaction to the recent events. Now, it appears that Apple has decided to join them by pulling many Civil War wargames from the App Store. As of the writing of this story, games like Ultimate General: Gettysburg and all the Hunted Cow Civil War games are nowhere to be found. Apple is famous for reaching for the axe rather than the scalpel when it comes to political issues (like rejecting Hunted Cow\u2019s Tank Battle 1942 for depicting Germans and Russians as enemies), so this move doesn\u2019t come as a great surprise.\nApple\u2019s Tim Cook has recently spoke against displaying the Confederate flag, so I suppose this development was to be expected. However, censoring historical games (if that is indeed the reason why the games have been pulled) is always very tricky because those games don\u2019t glorify or promote a cause but, rather, represent historical events using the symbols and insignia of the period. Still, I can also see the political and social pressures mounting at the moment, which makes pulling the games the \u201csafest\" action for Apple. What do you think? If Apple has indeed pulled the games for displaying the Confederate flag, is Apple\u2019s action justified, or was there another way to eradicate racism and remove the symbols and words that feed it, as Tim Cook put it?\nUpdate: It\u2019s looking like Apple has pulled everything from the App Store that features a Confederate flag, regardless of context. The reasoning Apple is sending developers is \u201c\u2026because it includes images of the confederate flag used in offensive and mean-spirited ways.\" We just spoke with Andrew from HexWar Games, who have released many historical strategy games. He insists, \u201cWe\u2019re in no way sympathetic to the use of the flag in an offensive way, we used it purely because historically that was the flag that was used at the time.\"\nThis is how the Confederate flag was displayed inside HexWar titles\nHexWar Games plans on attempting to re-submit their games using the lesser-known 1861 version of the Confederate flag. But, who knows if that will even be approved. No one is sure yet if Apple is banning all mention of the Confederacy, or just the specific image of the flag which has since become such a hot button issue in the USA.\nUpdate 2: We just received a statement from Maxim Zasov of Game Labs, the developers of Ultimate General: Gettysburg. It is as follows:\nWe accept Apple\u2019s decision and understand that this is a sensitive issue for the American Nation. We wanted our game to be the most accurate, historical, playable reference of the Battle of Gettysburg. All historical commanders, unit composition and weaponry, key geographical locations to the smallest streams or farms are recreated in our game\u2019s battlefield. We receive a lot of letters of gratitude from American teachers who use our game in history curriculum to let kids experience one of the most important battles in American history from the Commander\u2019s perspective. Spielberg\u2019s \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\" did not try to amend his movie to look more comfortable. The historical \u201cGettysburg\" movie (1993) is still on iTunes. We believe that all historical art forms: books, movies, or games such as ours, help to learn and understand history, depicting events as they were. True stories are more important to us than money. Therefore we are not going to amend the game\u2019s content and Ultimate General: Gettysburg will no longer be available on AppStore. We really hope that Apple\u2019s decision will achieve the desired results. We can\u2019t change history, but we can change the future.\nUltimate General: Gettysburg wasn\u2019t alone in focusing on tasteful, historical accuracy. The vast majority of the Civil War strategy games I\u2019ve played on my iPad put great emphasis on focusing on the historical significance of the battles, units, locations, and generals. We\u2019ve also heard that these types of games have been used as teaching tools, making their removal from the App Store feel that much more reactionary.\nUpdate 3: We now have an official Apple statement regarding the removal of the games. Specifically, Apple states that \u201cwe have removed apps from the App Store that use the Confederate flag in offensive or mean-spirited ways, which is in violation of our guidelines.\" Sources close to the company say that it\u2019s working with the developers affected by the flag ban to get the issue resolved and get the games back on the App Store. However, the developers will have to either remove or replace the Confederate flag. If this is indeed what Apple is demanding from the developers, it raises all kind of questions about censorship and historical memory as it literally risks rewriting history. Objectionable as it is, the existence of the Confederate flag in these Civil War games is historically accurate, and I\u2019m not sure that any company should have the ability to mold history to its standards and beliefs.\nUpdate 4: Apple has been clarifying their Confederate flag policy with developers who have had their games removed and is working with them to reinstate the games.",
