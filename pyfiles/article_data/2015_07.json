        "title": "Apple, please kill the 16GB iPhone",
        "body": "Enlarge Image Sarah Tew/CNET\nIn just a few short days, on September 9, Apple will introduce new iPhones, and if it follows its usual playbook, they'll be called the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus -- and be available for sale in many countries around the world by the Friday after next.\nAs an \"S\" model, we can expect the 2015 iPhones to maintain the same basic design as their 2014 predecessors, while incorporating some decent changes under the hood: a faster processor (definitely), a better camera (almost certainly) and a Force Touch screen that borrows some Apple Watch tricks ( rumored).\nUnfortunately, one thing that probably won't change is how much storage the entry-level iPhone 6S will have. Leaked images on 9to5mac back in July purported to show the new iPhone's logic board with a new Toshiba flash memory module that, according the site, has 16GB capacity. (While such images should always be approached with skepticism, author Mark Gurman has an excellent track record, and the images are convincing.) And more recently, 9to5mac and other Apple enthusiast sites have been citing unnamed sources saying a 16GB iPhone 6S and a 16GB iPhone 6S Plus are done deals.\nIn other words, it's looking more and more like a step up to a 32GB baseline isn't going to happen. And that's a problem.\nThe problem with 16GB\nFor the last several iPhone cycles, Apple has equipped the entry-level versions of its flagship phones with 16GB, charging $199 in the US with a two-year contract or \"carrier financing.\" The price for the unlocked version -- and in many cases the real price to you and me in the end -- is $649.\nLast year, when Apple moved to the iPhone 6, it did away with the 32GB version that was previously occupied the middle range of the iPhone 5/5S and earlier lines. Now you can buy the 64GB iPhone 6 for $749 (or $299 on contract) -- $100 more than the 16GB version. (Tack on another $100 if you want to go to the larger iPhone 6 Plus in any of these same capacities.) For anybody who was familiar with the limitations of owning a 16GB iPhone or iPad, that 64GB model -- or the step-up 128GB -- was the iPhone to get.\nThe fact is 16GB of storage space just doesn't cut it anymore. Once you shoot a bunch of pictures and videos, download a couple of graphically intensive games and a bulky app or two (Google Maps) and store some music on your phone, you start to hit the limit.\nIn moving to iOS 9 this fall, Apple announced it would dramatically reduce the size of its iOS updates (from around 4.6GB to 1.3GB) and trim the size of apps in general through a new feature called app thinning. But iOS 9 will still take up some space in the phone's flash storage (I have a 64GB iPhone 5S, with 54.2GB \"used\" and only 1.7GB \"available,\" which means about 8GB is devoted to iOS resources).\nThat will help owners of existing iPhones to free up additional storage space, but 16GB is still 16GB, and you'll use it up faster than you think, particularly as file sizes for photos and video grow as their resolution increases. In fact, rumor has it the next iPhones may feature 4K video capture -- videos that offer four times the resolution of standard 1080p HD shots.\nMinimal storage means maximum profits\nSo why not bump the entry-level iPhone up to 32GB? After all, most flagship Android smartphones -- such as the Samsung Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge , HTC One M9, LG G4 -- now start at 32GB. And some of them even still feature expandable storage.\nThe simple answer is profit margin.\nAccording to IHS, an analytics firm that does teardowns and estimates bills of materials for iPads, iPhones and other products, going from 16GB to 32GB of NAND flash memory would've cost Apple around $10 in September 2014 -- so probably even less almost a year later, with prices for memory drifting downward. Yes, that's a significant sum when you consider that, according to those aforementioned teardowns/bill of materials estimates, it costs Apple around $200 to build an iPhone 6 and $215 to build an iPhone 6 Plus.\nCurrent iPhones don't offer a 32GB option. Apple.com screenshot by John P. Falcone/CNET\nBetter yet -- for Apple anyway -- it costs you $750 to buy the 64GB iPhone 6, which conservatively costs Apple about $20 more to make than the 16GB version. From a margins standpoint, the 64GB and 128GB iPhones are by far more profitable, so Apple doesn't really want you to buy a 16GB iPhone.\nAnd the numbers show that Apple's plan to push consumers to the more expensive models is working. The average selling price for an iPhone in the final quarter of 2014 (when the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus first debuted in bulk) was $687. By comparison, the average selling price of an Android phone during the same period was less than half -- just $254. That's the primary reason Apple is the most valuable company in the world even as Android phone manufacturers struggle to make a profit.\nIt's time for a change\nWith numbers like that, I get it. This whole 16GB thing is working for Apple in a big way. The company is printing money, and many consumers are all too happy to pay the extra $100 or $200 to step up to the more capacious models.\nIt's even easier now that the carriers in the US are largely transitioning to a post-contract world, and letting you spread payments across a 24-month period. In that scenario, the jump from a 16GB iPhone to a 64GB model costs you just $4 more. Skip a latte or two each month, and the upgrade \"pays for itself.\"\nSo, it could be argued that there's \"no good reason\" to buy the entry-level 16GB iPhone.\nAnd yet people do. They just can't resist buying the cheapest of anything, even if it isn't in their best interest. In some cases, it may be businesses that are purchasing several units for their employees and want to save money while limiting what their employees can do with the phone (it's for business not personal use, so you shouldn't be playing games or shooting videos of your kids).\nAnd, to be sure, the low-capacity phones are important in developing nations, where products are even more price-sensitive. Consider the iPhone 5C , currently Apple's entry-level $450 phone (it's supposedly going away soon, with the 5S replacing it as the entry-level model). The 2013 product got the requisite $100 price drop when the newer iPhone 6 line was released last September, but -- for the newly more affordable 2014 model that's still being sold -- Apple chopped the internal storage from 16GB to an even paltrier 8GB. That's barely enough to fit the operating system, at least pre-iOS 9.\nThere's also the argument that local storage is less important now that everything is online. That's where Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller is coming from when, defending the existence of 16GB iOS devices on The Talk Show, a podcast hosted by noted Apple pundit John Gruber. He says that the hope is that cloud services like iCloud and Apple Music will enable the most price-conscious customer to \"live in an environment where they don't need gobs of local storage...\" (Go to 52:00 mark of the video to see Schiller's full response to Gruber's 16GB iPhone question).\nI'd be fine with that if Apple Music and iCloud storage beyond 5GB were free. But they aren't. So the equation gets even more cynical. You're selling a cure for a disease you created yourself. And that's just not right.\nBut that probably won't stop Apple from giving us new 16GB iPhones on September 9.\nEditors' note: This article was originally published on July 12, 2015 under the headline, \"Apple, please kill the 16GB iPhone.\" It has been updated to reflect the current news and rumors surrounding the release of the next iPhones.",

        "title": "T-Mobile adds Apple Music to its data-free music streaming plan",
        "body": "T-Mobile's controversial Music Freedom program just got a lot bigger. In an announcement today, CEO John Legere announced he was adding Apple Music to the carrier's free music-streaming program, joining Spotify, Google Play Music, Soundcloud, Tidal, and dozens of other services. Apple Music support will replace iTunes Radio, which had previously been supported. As a result, T-Mobile users will be able to stream endless quantities from Apple Music without counting against their data caps. In the weeks since the service launched, Legere says Apple Music has accounted for 80 percent of the requests made to Music Freedom.\nThe move is also likely to infuriate net neutrality advocates, who have objected to the Music Freedom program from the beginning as a prime example of zero-rating. While customers get to dodge charges, Music Freedom necessarily means discriminating against services that aren't part of the deal. The service puts video services like Vevo or even smaller music services like Pono at a huge disadvantage, since users will face now-unnecessary data charges any time they venture outside of a Music Freedom-approved service.\nStill, those lingering concerns don't seem to have stopped companies from signing on to Music Freedom, or customers from taking advantage of it. According to Legere, the services on Music Freedom now represent 95 percent of the music streamed in the United States, streaming 131 million songs per day and incurring what could otherwise be billions of dollars in data charges on a capped plan.",

        "title": "IBM to Purchase Up to 200,000 Macs Annually, With 50-75% of Employees Ultimately Switching From Lenovo",
        "body": "A year after teaming up with Apple on an enterprise partnership to push iOS devices and apps for business users, IBM is moving forward with plans to rapidly move its own employees onto Apple's platforms, MacRumors has learned.\nWhile IBM announced in an internal memo several months ago that it was planning to purchase up to 50,000 MacBooks for employees by the end of 2015, chief information officer Jeff Smith has revealed in a new internal video released to employees yesterday that he believes IBM could actually end up purchasing 150,000-200,000 Macs annually.\n\"I'd like to be able to offer these to everyone that can use it. We've got to find a way to make the overall cost the same or lower than PCs to make that happen. Would you be interested in helping me do that, because you guys know these devices\", and he said, \"No, Jeff, we'd never do that...very secretive, we never allow anyone in. You know, we just don't do that.\" And I said, \"Well who's your largest corporate customer?\" And he said \"Well, that customer has got about 25,000 MacBooks a year.\" And I said, \"Well we could be 150-200,000.\" And he goes \"Jeff, that's a great idea! We're gonna come here, you know, next week...you bring your whole team,\" and that's exactly what happened.\nIn the video, Smith relates a conversation he had with Apple's chief information officer Niall O'Connor about the possibility of a massive Mac deployment for IBM.\nIn a separate clip from the video, Smith describes a recent conversation between Tim Cook and IBM vice president Fletcher Previn in which Previn indicated the initiative could see 50\u201375 percent of IBM employees eventually converting to Macs from the Lenovo ThinkPads that are currently the company standard.\nApple and IBM, former rivals in the PC market, have been working increasingly closely together on both specialized enterprise-focused iOS apps and more recently on HealthKit and ResearchKit data management tools. With so many IBM employees now in line to switch to Macs for their work machines, the stage is setting up for even more collaboration going forward.\nUpdate: Given IBM's workforce of under 400,000 employees, it appears the \"200,000\" figure cited by Smith could be a total replacement cycle figure rather than an annual purchase amount. Still, based on a three or four year replacement cycle, IBM would easily become Apple's largest corporate customer.",

        "body": "Beats is introducing an updated version of its Studio over-ear headphones today, with the fourth-generation models dubbed Beats Studio Pro. The $350 headphones come 15 years after Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine debuted the original Studio headphones that launched the Beats brand into prominence.\nBeats has maintained the iconic look of the Studio headphones since their original debut, and that remains true with the new Studio Pro. But that iconic look now comes with completely overhauled performance focused on five areas: sound quality, voice performance, comfort/durability, connectivity, and ecosystem compatibility.\nWhen it comes to sound quality, Beats Studio Pro adopt most of Apple's latest technology including support for Personalized Spatial Audio with built-in motion accelerometer and gyroscope for dynamic head tracking, adaptive Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) with a dedicated processor and upgraded microphones plus playback correction to remove any ANC artifacts before the audio hits your ears, and a new proprietary transducer design with custom 40mm driver that delivers 80% lower distortion compared to the previous-generation Studio headphones.\nIn our early testing of the Studio Pro, we found solid audio quality with bass performance unsurprisingly a bit on the heavy side as Beats is known for, with very good Spatial Audio performance that tracked head movements well to keep audio anchored to the source device.\nEnhanced call performance is achieved with a combination of all-new digital microphones and machine learning, leading to a 27% increase in clarity compared to the previous Studio 3 headphones.\nBeats Studio Pro support three different connectivity options, including Class 1 Bluetooth, USB-C audio that supports both lossless audio and the ability to listen and charge simultaneously, and 3.5mm analog for compatibility with a broad array of audio devices including inflight systems and game controllers.\nWhen connected over USB-C, Beats Studio Pro offer the ability to switch between three different audio profiles: a tonally balanced Beats Signature profile, an Entertainment profile for movies and games, and a Conversation profile that removes some of the bass and is tuned to voice for phone calls, podcasts, and other spoken content.\nThe design of the Beats Studio Pro will be familiar to anyone who has used Studio headphones in the past, with a cushioned headband, a folding design for portability, and padded ear cups. The Studio Pro feature upgraded leather UltraPlush ear cups with memory foam for comfort and durability. The majority of the exterior remains primarily plastic, which reduces weight but delivers a less premium feel than the AirPods Max, although they're also priced $200 lower than Apple's over-ear option.\nWhile not officially rated for sweat- or water-resistance, Beats says it's confident the Studio Pro will stand up to workouts and similar potential exposures.\nplay\nBasic on-ear controls are primarily handled on the left ear cup, with a large Beats \"b\" button offering the usual single press for play/pause and answering calls, double press advancing tracks and hanging up calls, and triple press skipping backwards. A long press activates Siri if you don't want to use \"Hey \u200cSiri\u200c\" voice activation, while volume can be adjusted by pressing above or below the \"b\" button.\nThe right ear cup includes a small button that serves to power the headphones on and off, while holding it for three seconds enters pairing mode. Double pressing the button will switch between ANC and Transparency modes, or rotate between the available sound profiles if you're connected via USB-C. A 5-LED array below the power button provides feedback on battery level with a press but also blink while in pairing mode and in USB-C will light up to reflect which sound profile is currently active.\nIn order to deliver as much parity as possible across Apple and Android ecosystems, Beats Studio Pro do not feature a dedicated Apple audio chip, but Beats has worked with Apple's engineers to deliver most of that functionality via a custom Beats chip. One-touch pairing is supported on both iOS and Android with automatic setup for all devices on your iCloud or Google account. Support for Apple's Find My and Google's \u200cFind My\u200c Device services is included, while Apple users can use \"Hey \u200cSiri\u200c\" to easily access Apple's voice assistant.\nOne feature Apple users won't get at this time is automatic switching as you change devices. Google users will get a similar Audio Switch feature among Android, Chromebook, and other compatible devices, but Beats is still investigating how it might be able to add \u200ciCloud\u200c automatic switching in the absence of an Apple chip.\nBattery life for the Beats Studio Pro is rated at 24 hours with ANC or Transparency turned on and 40 hours with those features turned off. If you're running low on battery, a Fast Fuel feature will give you up to four hours of battery life from a 10-minute charge.\nBeats Studio Pro come with a new compact zippered carrying case made of a semi-rigid woven fabric, with an integrated exterior loop to carry them by a finger or to add a clip or carabiner. Interior pockets help keep your USB-C and 3.5mm cables organized, and a zippered interior pocket can hold additional small items. The headphones also come in new 100% fiber-based packaging.\nThe new Beats Studio Pro headphones are priced at $349.99 and are available to order from Apple and Amazon with shipments an in-store availability beginning tomorrow in the United States, Canada, France, and Germany. Color options include Black, Deep Brown, Navy, and Sandstone.",

        "body": "If you already use Office on a PC or iPad, you will find yourself right at home in Office 2016 for Mac. It works the way you expect, with the familiar Ribbon interface and powerful Task panes. Mac users will appreciate the modernized Office experience and the integration of Mac capabilities like Full Screen view and Multi-Touch gestures. With full Retina display support, your Office documents look sharper and more vibrant than ever. Click to expand...\nFollowing a beta testing period that began in March, Microsoft today announced the official launch of its next-generation office software designed for Mac users, Office 2016. The new Office 2016 software is the first major Mac release since Office 2011, and it brings new versions of, andwith redesigned, Retina optimized interfaces, new features, and a focus on collaboration and cloud integration.Office for Mac 2016 has adopted many elements previously found in the Windows version of Office and the mobile Office apps for better cross-platform familiarity. For example, Office for Mac now uses the Ribbon to organize tools and formatting options, plus there's a task pane for improved graphics customization in all three of the main Office apps, along with new themes and styles.The software includes a new Yosemite-style design that takes advantage of features like full-screen support, Retina displays, and multi-touch gestures, while cloud integration makes all Microsoft files available across a range of devices.2016 for Mac includes a new Design tab for quickly customizing layouts, colors, and fonts while working on a document, and the multi-author experience has been improved. There's a sharing interface at the top right of the app that allows multiple people to work on the same document at once, with threaded comments to communicate.2016 for Mac's chart preview feature suggests the charts that best fit a set of data and it adds deeper data analysis functionality with PivotTable slicers for dealing with large amounts of data to find patterns. Shortcuts withinand the other Office apps have been updated to match their Windows counterparts, and there's improved autocomplete and a better formula builder that makes it easier to create spreadsheets and add data.2016 for Mac includes an improved Presenter view that shows current slide, next slide, speaker notes, and a timer, much like thefor iOS app. In the top left, the presenter sees exactly what the audience sees, including animations in real time, for a better idea of how a presentation is going.

        "title": "Former iAd exec leaves Apple, suggests company platform is held back by user data privacy policy",
        "body": "Winston Crawford, a former advertising executive, has left Apple to join Drawbridge. The move comes at an interesting time given Tim Cook\u2019s recent comments on user data and privacy.\nDrawbridge is a relatively new company which helps marketers track user data across multiple mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. He joined as COO to help expand the tracking technology to new areas like offering the ability for retailers to show the same online shopping cart to a single customer across multiple devices.\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this move is Crawford\u2019s comments about Apple\u2019s way of doing ads. Going back to those thoughts shared by Tim Cook about not being in the business of harvesting user data for profit, and looking at what Drawbridge does, it\u2019s quite a startling contrast between the two.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe they [Apple] are interested in this capability because they have a strict policy around what they do with user data,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cIAd has great assets and great capabilities, but they are going to follow Apple\u2019s policy to the letter of the law.\u201d\nIn other words, he believes that because iAd doesn\u2019t harvest and share private user information with marketers, that the service is restricted or held back. His suggestion then is that Apple\u2019s moral code gets in the way of a potentially very promising platform.\nPersonally, I\u2019d rather know that my user data was safe. Drawbridge\u2019s technology \u2013 on first read \u2013 sounds quite terrifying. As reported by the Wall Street Journal:\nDrawbridge\u2019s technology works to identify users by applying machine-learning techniques to large amounts of data generated from devices. The goal is to estimate the probability that multiple devices belong to the same person. If a desktop computer and a smartphone are connecting to the same WiFi network, the network will recognize the unique ID in each device and pass that information to Drawbridge.\nOn the other \u2014 (slightly) more comforting \u2014 hand, Drawbridge doesn\u2019t store or save people\u2019s real identities in its database. Rather, it builds its database using identification numbers and creates anonymous profiles from those. I still can\u2019t help but feel it\u2019s more than a little invasive.\nDrawbridge has reportedly doubled in size just over the past 12 months and it\u2019s perhaps against the backdrop of this knowledge that Tim Cook voiced his thoughts on privacy. Maybe it\u2019s time for Apple to do a re-boot of its \u201cBig Brother\u201d ad.",

        "title": "iPod Touch performance preview: 500% better CPU, 900% faster graphics",
        "body": "Smartphones and tablets have stopped changing all that much from year to year, which makes it easy to take for granted just how far they've come in such a relatively short time. One year of updates doesn't do much to impress anymore, but take three or four years of updates all at once and you'll have something to be impressed by.\nSuch is the case with the sixth-generation iPod Touch, which brings three years' and four generations' worth of processor improvements all at the same time. Jumping from an Apple A5 to an A8 results in an almost comically large performance improvement, though as we'll see, you're not quite getting iPhone 6 performance in an iPod-sized body.\nThe CPU\nThe iPod's A8 is running at around 1.1GHz, roughly 27 percent slower than the 1.4GHz A8 in the iPhone 6. When those phones were announced, Apple said the A8 was about 25 percent faster than the Apple A7 in the iPhone 5S\u2014as you can probably guess, slowing the thing down by 300MHz makes it perform a whole lot like an A7.\nSometimes the higher-clocked 1.3GHz A7 beats the 1.1GHz A8; sometimes the newer architecture of the A8 trumps the older design of the A7. All of our standard benchmarks show that the two behave pretty much the same way in the majority of situations, though.\nWe've compared the new iPod to the old one, but there's really no comparison. Depending on the benchmark, the A8 is around five times as fast as the A5, and a look at Geekbench's micro-benchmarks can show even bigger improvements in some workloads.\nThe cryptographic benches are particularly surprising: the SHA1 test runs over ten times faster on the A8. The AES test runs about 53 times faster. Hardware AES and SHA acceleration are a couple of the features added in the 64-bit ARMv8 instruction set\u2014the move to 64-bit in mobile is about way more than the RAM limit.\nAdvertisement\nThe GPU\nHere's where things get a little more interesting, both because the A8's GPU was a bigger improvement over the A7's and because the iPod has a smaller, lower-resolution screen than any of the iPhones.\nThe A8's GPU is around ten times as fast as the A5's, depending on what test you're looking at. Even more significant is the fact that the A5's GPU can't even run a lot of these tests, since it supports neither OpenGL ES 3.0 nor the Metal graphics API.\nWe fired up the Metal version of GFXBench to look at how the A8 stacked up to the A7 in the iPhone 5S and the A8 in the iPhone 6, and it looks like its speed hasn't been capped quite as aggressively as the CPU's. The Offscreen tests all render a 1080p image regardless of the screen's actual resolution\u2014the iPod and the iPhone 6 turn in essentially identical scores for all tests. Most of the time, the A7 is around two-thirds the speed of both A8s.\nThe Onscreen tests render at the device's native resolution, taking screens into account. Here, the iPod can run the tougher Manhattan test around 33 percent faster than the iPhone. In tests that also tax the CPU (particularly the overall and physics scores for 3DMark) the slower CPU in the iPod still helps the iPhone pull ahead, but in pure graphics the two are on the same footing. If you don't need a cellular connection, this iPod is an ideal portable gaming device.\nThere's more to the new iPod than raw performance, but these numbers are probably the most interesting thing about it. We'll be publishing a full review next week that dives into the camera and the battery life, and we'll also take a look at the heat output of that powerful new processor.",

        "title": "Beta testers can no longer post app reviews in prerelease iOS versions",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nIt appears that Apple is disallowing iOS 9 beta users to submit app reviews \u2014 positive or negative \u2014 with the latest build released on Tuesday, a feature that was becoming an increasingly irritating thorn in the side of developers since Apple opened its public beta program earlier this year.\nTesters running Apple's fourth iOS 9 beta, currently for developers only, are able to access the iOS App Store as usual, but no longer have the ability to post reviews. Attempting to do so now results in an error pop-up that reads, \"This feature isn't available. You can't write reviews while using a prerelease version of iOS.\"\nAppleInsider reader Lars was first to spot the change.\nApple likely deprecated the feature to prohibit users unfamiliar with beta software builds from posting unduly critical assessments of apps that, for whatever reason, are incompatible with the upcoming system update.\nWhile a good portion of iOS apps work as intended on iOS 9, there are a few that experience stalls, crashes and other hangups not present when running under iOS 8.4, the most up-to-date consumer release. The two systems may be mutually exclusive, but the underpinning services are not. Posting negative reviews based on an experience within a beta environment has a very real impact on developers, as they can be viewed by and sway the opinion of average App Store customers.\nIndeed, a number of titles in the iOS App Store have seen their star ratings drop after Apple released its iOS 9 public beta. What's more, developers are unable to submit patches for problems discovered in iOS 9 , only updates for iOS 8. This means most issues end users run into will remain unfixed until the next-generation operating system debuts this fall.\nThe problem has existed for some time, but with previous beta programs the impact was slight because access was limited to a rather small pool of users. And those users were, for the most part, developers. Issues became increasingly pronounced after Apple opened wide access to early iOS and OS X builds through its \"public beta\" program, entry into which is as easy as signing up.\nRelatively more stable than developer-only builds, OS betas labeled \"public\" are still just that, unfinished software that hasn't been fully vetted by Apple or the thousands of app developers coding for it.",

        "title": "Spotify urges iPhone customers to stop paying through Apple's App Store",
        "body": "Spotify is trying to raise awareness around the fact that it's cheaper to subscribe on the web instead of through Apple's App Store. The leading subscription music service plans to email iPhone customers the below note encouraging them, if they haven't already, to start paying at Spotify.com and save a few dollars. \"In case you didn\u2019t know, the normal Premium price is only $9.99, but Apple charges 30 percent on all payments made through iTunes,\" the email blast reads. \"You can get the exact same Spotify for only $9.99/month, and it\u2019s super simple.\"\nThe message is followed with a step-by-step tutorial that explains how to shut off auto-renew through iTunes (so Apple won't keep charging you the higher $12.99-per-month rate) and transfer your account to the web \u2014 something that can only be done once your current subscription lapses. \"Pardon us if you can't do this immediately. Your current plan needs to end first,\" Spotify says.\nApple has received plenty of criticism from rival music services over the 30 percent cut it takes from in-app subscriptions. And those complaints have only grown louder with the launch of Apple Music, the company's own all-you-can-eat music product. Implementing pricing parity across the web and iOS would mean less money for Spotify, a company that already posts bigger and bigger losses the larger it grows. Apple is reportedly facing inquiries from the US Justice Department and FTC over its rumored pressuring of record labels to dismantle Spotify's free streaming tier, a feature that sets it apart from Apple Music.",

        "title": "Intel Skylake Processors: Up to 20% Performance Boost, 41% Faster Graphics and 30% Longer Battery Life",
        "body": "Less than two weeks before Intel announces new desktop Skylake processors, likely to be used in future Macs, at the Gamescom trade show in Germany on August 5, FanlessTech has leaked an Intel slide deck that offers a closer look at some of the performance enhancements the next-generation processors will deliver for both desktop computers and notebooks.\nThe leaked slides reveal that Skylake processors will provide a 10%-20% CPU performance boost in single and multi-threaded applications, with lower power consumption, and 30% faster Intel HD integrated graphics performance on average compared to current-generation Broadwell processors. The improved energy efficiency will also result in up to 30% longer battery life.\nThe specific performance improvements to the four main Skylake families are outlined below based on preliminary data, with the MacBook model appropriate for each chip listed in parentheses:\n- Y-Series (MacBook): Up to 17% faster CPU, up to 41% faster Intel HD graphics, up to 1.4 hours longer battery life\n- U-Series (MacBook Air): Up to 10% faster CPU, up to 34% faster Intel HD graphics, up to 1.4 hours longer battery life\n- H-Series (MacBook Pro): Up to 11% faster CPU, up to 16% faster Intel HD graphics, up to 80% lower silicon power\n- S-Series (iMac): Up to 11% faster CPU, up to 28% faster Intel HD graphics, 22% lower TDP (thermal design power)\nApple refreshed the MacBook Air and 13\" Retina MacBook Pro with the latest Broadwell processors in March, but the refreshed 15\" Retina MacBook Pro released in May remains powered by two-year-old Haswell architecture due to the lack of quad-core Broadwell processors appropriate for the notebook at the time.\nGiven that Intel announced a trio of Core i7 processors appropriate for the 15\" Retina MacBook Pro just weeks later, and both the iMac and Mac mini still have Haswell processors, it is plausible that Apple has chosen to skip Broadwell processors entirely and release Skylake-based Macs in late 2015 or early 2016 -- and the jump from Haswell to Skylake would deliver an even higher performance boost.\nTaiwanese blog DigiTimes, which has a hit-and-miss track record at reporting on Apple's upcoming product plans, says that Intel is planning to launch 18 new Skylake processors for notebooks in the fourth quarter, starting in October. The mid-range and high-end processors could be used in the next-generation 12-inch MacBook, MacBook Air and Retina MacBook Pro.",

        "body": "Apple is today launching its Back to School promotion for 2015. This year, it will give away a free pair of Beats Solo2 headphones with the purchase of an eligible Mac. Customers must either purchase an iMac, MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, or Mac Pro with education pricing to qualify, including build-to-order configurations. The Mac mini does not participate in the deal.\nAlternatively, customers can upgrade for an additional $100 to a pair of wireless Beats Solo2 headphones, rather than the usual $299 price. The announcement is not yet being advertised on Apple.com apart from a small mention on its rebates page. It is surprising that there appears to be no Back to School promotion for iPads this year, despite Apple pushing the tablet into education markets.\nIn previous years, Apple has given away gift cards alongside purchases of eligible products like Macs and iPads. This is the first year the promotion includes a Beats product as the \u2018free gift\u2019. For instance, last year a Mac purchase would get you a $100 gift card and a purchase of an iPhone or iPad would get you a free $50 gift card.\nYou can read the full terms and conditions for Apple\u2019s current Back to School deal here. The offer runs from today through September 18th at Apple retail sales. Online sales are eligible for the promotion from August 6th until September 18th.\nThanks @KOTULCN for the heads up on Twitter.",

        "title": "Opinion: A Mac\u2019s longevity is its biggest unsung selling point",
        "body": "Apple can\u2019t advertise Macs as having ten-year lifespans for legal reasons, and reviewers rarely write about their old computers ten years later \u2014 they\u2019re typically focused on each year\u2019s latest and greatest machine. But the average person buys a computer and keeps using it until it stops working, something I note every time a friend or family member \u201cfinally\u201d upgrades from an old Mac to a new one.\nThis morning, Christopher Phin\u2019s article \u201cSaying goodbye to a beloved 2008 MacBook Pro\u201d recalled the many end-of-life Mac discussions I\u2019ve had with people over the years \u2014 specifically that their still-working-but-old Macs are so antiquated that virtually every internal component has been replaced in current models. Yet no one ever says they\u2019re switching from an old Mac to a new PC; instead, the conversation is always about figuring out which new Mac to buy, or whether to squeeze a little more life from the old machine with a hard drive to SSD swap or additional RAM.\nThe superb longevity of Macs isn\u2019t discussed very often, but it\u2019s due as much to the durability of the hardware as the engineering of the software. Let\u2019s take a quick look at what keeps Macs going so long\u2026\nOS X\nAt 9to5Mac, we focus a lot on new versions of the Mac\u2019s OS X operating system: point releases (\u201c10.9\u201d to \u201c10.10\u201d), point point releases (\u201c10.10.1\u201d to \u201c10.10.2\u201d), and even beta releases (\u201c10.11 beta 3\u201d). But many users \u2014 particularly ones who bought their last Macs nearly a decade ago \u2014 care little, if at all, about new releases of OS X. They don\u2019t need to: even old versions of OS X \u201cjust work\u201d well enough for most people.\nHard-core Mac fans would be amazed at how many 2015 Mac upgraders are still running OS X Lion, which came out four years ago, or earlier versions of the operating system such as 2007\u2019s OS X Leopard, the last to support PowerPC processors. Yes, it\u2019s true: there are some Mac users who have never upgraded OS X to a new major release over the Internet, used iCloud, or even seen the Mac App Store.\nAs hard as that may be to believe, that\u2019s actually a testament to the Mac\u2019s excellence as a platform. It\u2019s not surprising that users can continue to use 2007- or 2011-vintage software to send emails, browse web pages, use productivity apps, and play games. For the most part, apps that run on older Macs continue to run on newer ones. And it\u2019s actually a huge plus that someone who transitions from Lion to a newer version of OS X won\u2019t have to re-learn anything fundamental (apart, perhaps, from certain multi-touch gestures) to keep using the Mac just as he or she did before. The screenshots above show obvious cosmetic improvements, but nothing that would stop users of older OS X versions from understanding new ones.\nWhile it\u2019s true that the iterative nature of OS X\u2019s evolution means that there hasn\u2019t been a \u201cmust upgrade\u201d OS X change for regular people in years, moving up to OS X Yosemite (or the forthcoming El Capitan) from a much older version comes with an uncountably huge collection of small quality-of-life improvements. And depending on the number of years that have elapsed between one\u2019s upgrades, significant software features such as AirDrop, Notification Center and Push Notifications, AirPlay Mirroring, iCloud, iBooks, and Continuity may seem entirely new to some people. None of these things is critical, but they all make the Mac experience better.\nThe other key thing about OS X that many mainstream users don\u2019t realize is that under-the-hood software improvements routinely make old Macs run better than they did when originally purchased. Some years\u2019 OS X tweaks improve battery life under certain conditions, while others speed up graphics or general app performance. There are certainly bugs that come up, creating new issues here and there, but the overall trend of OS X has been continuous annual improvement.\nMac Hardware\nFor legal reasons \u2014 namely, added warranty responsibilities \u2014 Apple doesn\u2019t promise users that their new Macs will last for ten years. But with rare exceptions, it builds Macs to keep running for around that long. Unlike Dell, which in the name of low prices knowingly churned out millions of computers with cheap, shoddy parts, Apple typically selects components that will continue to work for a long time unless (and sometimes even if) seriously abused. Although the company was working towards this goal in the early 2000\u2019s, the real turning point came in late 2008 when Apple began to phase out plastic-bodied MacBooks in favor of universally metal models. There had previously been reason to believe that plastic MacBooks and their iBook predecessors were designed to be replaced every few years. Going forward, there wasn\u2019t much question that all Macs were built to last.\nExterior resilience aside, the major reason for excellent Mac longevity has been a radical reduction in the number and nature of components inside modern Macs. Compare the inside of 2008\u2019s first all-metal MacBook with 2015\u2019s new all-metal 12\u2033 Retina MacBook and you\u2019ll see how a huge circuit board tied to two mechanical drives gave way to a candybar-sized logic board and exclusively chip-based storage. Fewer parts and fewer moving parts means fewer potential points of failure, as well as much greater energy efficiency, and typically faster speeds. This has been Apple\u2019s hardware engineering philosophy for nearly two decades now, and it keeps getting better every year.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that every Mac is perfect. Certain components, particularly high-end graphics processors, high-capacity traditional hard drives, and certain early Retina screens, were prone to developing issues over time that Apple has been forced (typically via class action suits) to address with free repair programs beyond their original warranties. But these are exceptions to the general rule that a Mac will run as well (or better) several years down the line as it did on day one.\nRepurposing\nOne of the big things I\u2019ve noticed when people buy new Macs is their tendency to keep old ones around rather than trade them in for cash. Even if your Mac was purchased in the 2000\u2019s, it\u2019s entirely possible that it has enough processing power and hard drive space to serve as an iTunes media server for your home, a basic video player for a bedroom, or starter computer for a young student. There are brand new, low-cost Windows PCs being sold today that are less capable of doing these things than an old Mac. So unless you need the cash to finance a new Mac purchase \u2014 which can be significant thanks to strong retained resale value \u2014 hanging on to your prior machine can be worthwhile, and the old Mac can be useful for years to come.\nAll of this is to say that for Mac users, at least, it\u2019s hard to complain about the \u201cApple tax\u201d PC fans used to harp on. It\u2019s certainly true that Macs are more expensive than PCs. But with a Mac, you certainly get what you pay for, and sometimes much more than expected. More often than not, replacing a Mac is an option rather than a necessity, and something undertaken many years after the initial purchase.\nMore From This Author\nCheck out more of my How-To guides and reviews for 9to5Mac here!

        "title": "Apple hires former Fiat Chrysler exec for its rumored electric car team",
        "body": "According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, Apple has hired a seasoned veteran from the automotive industry for its rumored car initiative. The report claims that Apple has hired Doug Betts, who previously led global quality control at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Betts worked at Fiat Chrysler until last year and started at Apple earlier this month.\nWhile details of Betts\u2019 role at Apple are sparse at this point, he has updated his LinkedIn page to reflect his new position. His profile says he joined Apple in July, but only lists his title as \u201cOperations \u2013 Apple Inc.\u201d out of San Francisco.\nThe report goes on to state that Apple also recently hired one of the top autonomous vehicle researchers from Europe. Earlier this year, the WSJ reported that Tim Cook approved Apple\u2019s electric car project back in 2014 and has assigned \u201chundreds\u201d of employees to the project\u2019s team. It has been reported in the past that Apple has hired president and CEO of Mercedes-Benz Research & Development Johann Jungwirth, along with other auto industry execs. We broke down some of the notable members of Apple\u2019s car team here, as well.\nFurthermore regarding hires for its electric car team, Apple has been in an ongoing poaching war with Tesla. Although earlier this year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk pointed out that his company has poached 5 times as many employees from Apple as Apple has from Tesla. Musk also commented that he \u201chopes\u201d Apple will enter the car market.\nApple is hoping to launch its own car by the year 2020, according to reports from earlier this year.",

        "body": "Just a day after releasing a new set of developer builds for iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan, Apple today launched its public beta program for both upcoming operating systems. Apple had announced at WWDC last month that it would launch the public betas in July, and a new support document published yesterday regarding changes to two-factor authentication hinted a launch was imminent.\niOS and Mac users interested in trying out the public betas can sign up on Apple's beta software program page\nWe'll be looking for any changes specific to the public beta versions, but they are almost certainly essentially identical to the developer seeds released yesterday.\niOS 9 is the first major version of Apple's mobile operating system to see a public beta release, as the company did not initiate the program for iOS until iOS 8.3 earlier this year. OS X users may already be familiar with the public beta process, as a similar program was in place for OS X Yosemite last year.",

        "title": "42% of iPhone 6 owners in the U.S. say they've used Apple Pay",
        "body": "42 percent of iPhone 6 users in the U.S. have used Apple Pay, according to new research from analysts at the The Auriemma Consulting Group.\nThe same study suggests that Apple Pay is no one-off novelty either, since 84 percent of these users have used Apple Pay for more than three transactions in store, while 76 percent have used it to pay for items in-app.\nInterestingly, the 42 percent of Apple Pay users is virtually identical to the number of users Auriemma recorded when it carried out similar bits of research in February and April.\nWhile the number of places accepting Apple Pay has increased over the course of 2015, this would suggest that it is still largely the same early adopters who are using Apple\u2019s mobile payments system \u2014 although it\u2019s likely that more will be using it thanks to the arrival of the Apple Watch.\nThe Auriemma Consulting Group carried out its study by interviewing 500 iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners between May 29 and June 15. Given that Apple has sold well over 100 million iPhone 6 units by now around the world, if these figures prove representative in the U.S. \u2014 which remains Apple\u2019s biggest market \u2014 that\u2019s a whole lot of people using Apple\u2019s payment platform.\nIt will be interesting to see how it compares to the first reports of Apple Pay adoption in the U.K, where the service just launched this month. The difference between the U.K. and U.S. is that users in the United Kingdom have been using NFC payments for a few years now. On the one hand, this makes Apple Pay less of a novelty, although it also means there\u2019s far more existing awareness of NFC.",

        "title": "Apple Reports Q3 2015 Earnings of $10.7B on $49.6B Revenue: 47.5M iPhones, 10.9M iPads, 4.8M Macs",
        "body": "Apple today announced financial results for the third fiscal quarter and second calendar quarter of 2015. For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of $49.6 billion and net quarterly profit of $10.7 billion, or $1.85 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $37.4 billion and net quarterly profit of $7.7 billion, or $1.28 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.\nGross margin for the quarter was 39.7 percent compared to 39.4 percent in the year-ago quarter, with international sales accounting for 64 percent of revenue. Apple also declared an upcoming dividend payment of $0.52 per share, payable on August 13 to shareholders of record as of August 10. The company currently holds $202.8 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nApple sold 47.5 million iPhones during the quarter, up from 35.2 million a year earlier, while Mac sales registered 4.8 million units, up from 4.4 million units in the year-ago quarter. iPad sales continued to decline, however, falling to 10.9 million from 13.3 million.\n\u201cWe had an amazing quarter, with iPhone revenue up 59 percent over last year, strong sales of Mac, all-time record revenue from services, driven by the App Store, and a great start for Apple Watch,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cThe excitement for Apple Music has been incredible, and we\u2019re looking forward to releasing iOS 9, OS X El Capitan and watchOS 2 to customers in the fall.\u201d\nApple's guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 includes expected revenue of $49-51 billion and gross margin between 38.5 and 39.5 percent.\nApple will provide live streaming of its fiscal Q3 2015 financial results conference call at 2:00 PM Pacific, and MacRumors will update this story with coverage of the conference call highlights.\nConference Call and Q&A Highlights are available in reverse chronological order after the jump.\n2:58 pm: The call is complete!\n2:58 pm: A: Our June sales were higher than April or May. June sales were the highest. Watch had a more backended skewing. Phone followed normal, seasonal kind of pattern. If you look at, honing in on Greater China results, no obvious impact from last quarter in the Greater China numbers. With aggregate or consolidated number being 112%, it's hard to find a lot of bad things in the numbers.\n2:56 pm: Would have higher gross margin if it weren't for currencies. Look at every country except China and it's weaker against the dollar. Don't like changing pricing. Circumstances around the world where we had no choice because currency move was so large. Look, in the long run a strong US dollar is not a positive for International business. Normal to see drop in demand as prices go up. Remarkable to see how resilient iPhone sales have been because we have increased sales and we've increased market share in all our geographies around the world without exception.\n2:55 pm: Q: Talk about FX, but not from direct impact... what are you seeing in terms of demand as you raise prices in various geographies? How are you thinking about it in next iPhone cycle in terms of normalizing pricing for some currencies?\n2:54 pm: A: In some geographies, the way that we win is to get switchers. In others the way we win is to get people to buy their first smartphone. In others, we get people to upgrade their iPhone. In some it's two of those. In others it's all three. We are very focused. Getting our message out with ads is how we do that.\n2:54 pm: Q: New ads? If it's not an iPhone it's not an iPhone.\n2:53 pm: For all of us that travel there so much, you can see this occurring. We would be foolish to change our plans. China is a fantastic geography with an incredible, unprecedented level of opportunity there. We're going to be there.\n2:52 pm: Q: We remain extremely bullish on China, we continue to invest. Nothing has changed our fundamental view that China will remain Apple's largest market in the future. Equity markets has recently been volatile, could create speed bumps in near term. Despite volatility in the Chinese market, they're still up 90% in the last year. Up 20% year to date. These numbers are ones all of us would love. Stock market participation among Chinese households is fairly narrow, very concentrated. I think generally this has been, at least as we see it, this worry is probably overstated. We're not changing anything. We have the pedal to the metal, expanding stores, indirect channel. As you point out, this is a major point, LTE penetration is only at 12%. China doesn't possess level of fiber that some other countries do, in order to get great video performance, raising that penetration is really great. That really plays to an incredible smartphone future there. Also, I can't overstate this the rise of the middle class there is continuing and it's transforming China.\n2:50 pm: Q: Some concern in China with stock market and economically. More stores and broader distribution, 4G infrastructure is playing out, but economy might be weakening. Is phone a discretionary purchase?\n2:49 pm: In emerging markets, our share isn't high in any of them, same with many developed markets. I look around and see opportunity left and right.\n2:49 pm: The Mac continues to perform very well. Apple Pay, Apple Music, I'm still bullish on iPad. Incredible productivity enhancements coming in. Split view, slide over, picture in picture. Enterprise is picking up. More and more companies are contracting for or writing apps themselves. And I believe that the iPad consumer upgrade cycle will eventually occur. If we look at usage statistics on iPad, it remains great. Compare to next competitor, we're 6x greater. It's not like people have forgotten iPad or anything.\n2:48 pm: A: We think the phone has a lot of legs left to it. Tons of innovation left on the phone. We're in the early innings, not the late innings. Market rate of growth in the long haul will also be impressive. Multiple winners here. That's how I see it. In terms of other things that we're doing, we have some great capabilities and great teams and we can do more than one thing. We have other things that we're working on as well. At the aggregate level we still remain very focused. That's how we do things and get the level of quality.\n2:46 pm: Q: iPhone, iPad and iPod. iPhone looks like it has many tough comps next few quarters. Broadening your reliance on some products? Apple Radio, Apple Watch, Apple Pay? Are you increasingly focusing on peripheral activities?\n2:42 pm: We don't do MBA analysis of \"There's X people in price band so we can only get X-Y%\"\n2:42 pm: A: We look at it a bit differently. Our job is to grow our products regardless of the price. We need to convince some people to move from one price band to another. If we do a great job with the product, people will be willing to spend more because they get so much more out of it. Look at the results on the iPhone and see that in action. Grew 87% in China, 90%+ in India. Emerging markets are growing 65%. These numbers are unbelievable. Done in an environment where\n2:41 pm: Q: If you think about iPhone and your market share in premium category, how do you think about it? I've seen market data, says 60% market share on phones above $300. 90% market share for phones above $600. Could you talk about how you think about your market share, where you play, given that ASP is comfortably above $600. What is your market share above $500 in smartphones? How do we think about that market share going forward?\n2:40 pm: Feel fantastic about what we've done and delivered. Never gone anywhere without the watch, I'm not just the CEO, I'm that attached to it.\n2:40 pm: Customer sat is off the charts. If you get customer sat, you can do fairly well over time. Also learned a lot about managing quite an assortment and so forth.\n2:39 pm: We've learned a lot about the buying experience, based on that, we're planning to expand our channel before the holiday because we're convinced that the watch is going to be one of the top gifts of the holiday season.\n2:39 pm: As I look at all of these things, we feel really great about how we did. Objective wasn't primarily sales. Beyond the very good news on sales, we're more excited about the possibilities. Native apps coming, they're going to be killer.\n2:38 pm: Sales of the watch did exceed expectations. Supply still trailed demand at the end of the quarter. Apple Watch sell through was higher than comparable launch periods of original iPhone and iPad.\n2:37 pm: To give some color... look at other product categories, and look at revenue in this category, it would not be an accurate thing to look at sequential change or year over year change and assume that were total watch revenue. Sequentially and year over year, iPod is shrinking. Other accessories are shrinking.\n2:37 pm: A: We made a decision back in September not to disclose shipments on the Watch. Not on whether we were transparent, but not to give too much to competitors.\n2:36 pm: Q: More thoughts on Apple Watch?\n2:35 pm: As we look at it on a macro level, every cycle is different, not everything in our control. Currency markets are different from one year to the next. Present an additional challenge given where the dollar has moved. Commodity markets are different from one year to another.\n2:35 pm: Q: More thoughts on gross margin?\n2:32 pm: A: We have hedges but will be an impact. Seasonality for back to school, and preparation for big fall. Commodity costs continue to be favorable, so partial offset.\n2:32 pm: Q: Foreign exchange headwinds?\n2:30 pm: Everybody is going to own a smartphone, we've proven that we can compete for a fair number of those.\n2:29 pm: A: We purposely give guidance for the quarter. The numbers that we have indicated growth in the revenue means that iPhone would have another stellar quarter. Very confident that this quarter is great. How the future looks? We'll take it one quarter at a time.\n2:28 pm: Q: You're lapping some pretty significant comps related to upgrades and significant growth in China. What is framework that you use to convince yourselves that iPhone units can continue to grow in the longer term?\n2:28 pm: Highest Android switcher rate we've observed. iPhone is doing outstanding.\n2:27 pm: A: 35% growth is almost 3x the market, if you look at it at a narrower regional level, grew 4x market in Europe, Japan 5x market. Doubled in Korea vs market that was shrinking, India grew at 93%.\n2:25 pm: Q: Year on year iPhone growth was strong, but sequential numbers were weaker than in the past. Why drain channel inventory?\n2:24 pm: Luca is going over the forward-looking estimates from the press release.\n2:23 pm: $202.8 billion in cash, 89% of the total is offshore.\n2:22 pm: Global store count of 456, 190 outside the US. 40 stores open in Greater China by middle of next year.\n2:22 pm: Retail and online stores had strong quarter, customer visits up 49% driven by strong interest in Apple Watch. Mobile traffic to online stores during quarter equaled desktop traffic for first time ever.\n2:20 pm: Mentioning corporate adoption of iPad across numerous countries and companies.\n2:18 pm: We are extremely successful where we compete for tablets. 76% of tablet market for tablets over $200.\n2:18 pm: 97% customer satisfaction rate on iPad Air 2. More than half of buyers who want to get a tablet plan to buy an iPad.\n2:17 pm: Mac growth was driven by portables, including strong customer reception of the new MacBook.\n2:16 pm: 35% year over year growth in iPhone, demand for 6 and 6 Plus has been terrific.\n2:15 pm: Drop of 1 million units in channel inventory, making results more impressive.\n2:15 pm: Very challenging foreign exchange environment continues.\n2:14 pm: Growth driven by tremendous growth in iPhone and Apple Watch.\n2:14 pm: Luca coming on the call now.\n2:14 pm: Very hard at work on exciting pipeline of new hardware, software and services. Passionately committed to leaving the world better than we found it.\n2:14 pm: 700 universities and colleges are going to be adapting Apple Pay too.\n2:13 pm: Apple Pay coming to Square Reader this fall.\n2:12 pm: Launched Apple Pay in the UK recently.\n2:12 pm: Millions are tuning into Beats 1.\n2:11 pm: 15,000 artists signed up for Connect.\n2:11 pm: Millions and millions of customers are already experiencing the new service, and the numbers are growing substantially every day.\n2:11 pm: Thrilled with the response to Apple Music.\n2:11 pm: Citing partners for the News app coming in iOS 9.\n2:10 pm: Talking about updated OS's coming this fall, OS X El Capitan, iOS 9, WatchOS 2.\n2:08 pm: Just the beginning of what this new platform can deliver. With WatchOS 2, developers can build richer and more powerful native apps.\n2:08 pm: User experience for Apple Pay and Siri is nothing short of incredible. Customers are enjoying 8500 third-party apps.\n2:07 pm: Doctors and researchers at leading hospitals in the US and Europe are putting Apple Watch to work improving patients' lives.\n2:07 pm: Possibilities for Apple Watch are enormous.\n2:07 pm: Feedback is incredibly positive, very happy with customer satisfaction and usage statistics. 97% customer satisfaction rate for Apple Watch, and we hear from people every day about the impact it's having on health, daily routines and how they communicate. 94% of Apple Watch owners wear and use it every day.\n2:06 pm: Major highlight was the launch of the Apple Watch in April. Started taking preorders in 9 countries on April 10, demand immediately exceeded supply. We delayed availability of Apple Watch in our own retail stores until mid-June. Huge progress with production ramp, expanded into 6 additional countries in late June. Expanded Apple Watch availability to 19 countries, with three more countries coming at the end of the month.\n2:05 pm: Generated 5 billion in services revenue, setting a new all-time record. Within services, App Store produced best quarter ever with revenue growing 24%. Results from Greater China were outstanding, revenue growth of 112%, iPhone unit growth of 87%. Particularly impressive given IDC's estimate of only 5% growth for greater china smartphone market. Highest ever PC market share in the segment, Mac sales up 33% over last year. Ecosystem continues to grow at a very fast pace, App Store revenue more than doubled in the quarter.\n2:04 pm: Record quarter for Mac, unit growth of 9% vs market contraction of 12%.\n2:04 pm: Experienced highest switcher rate from Android that we've ever measured. iPhone customer metrics were tremendous, iPhone has highest customer satisfaction rate of any smartphone brand by a wide margin. Among iPhone owners planning to purchase a new phone, 86% plan to purchase a new iPhone. Just 50% for next highest brand measured.\n2:03 pm: Established new June quarter record for iPhone, sales up 35%, 3x rate of growth of the smartphone market. Gained share in all geographic segments.\n2:03 pm: Topped internal expectations for sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch.\n2:03 pm: Reduced channel inventory across product lines by 1 million units and challenging FX environment.\n2:02 pm: Year over year growth rate accelerated over the first half of fiscal 2015. Revenues up 35%, earnings up 45%.\n2:02 pm: It's been a busy and exciting quarter and I'm excited to talk to you about the highlights.

        "title": "Apple Music hits 10M subscribers in four weeks, report says",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nA day shy of its one-month anniversary, Apple Music has reeled in more than 10 million subscribers on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and iTunes, a report said Monday.\nAnonymous sources connected to major music labels provided the supposed adoption numbers to HITS Daily Double, saying the swift and substantial uptake is surprising even for Apple. The data reportedly comes directly from Cupertino, which is sharing streaming statistics internally with content owners.\nThe report's veracity is questionable \u2014 the site calls its main news section the \"Rumor Mill\" \u2014 but 10 million subscribers in four weeks is within the realm of possibility for Apple's mammoth installed customer base. Earlier in July, for example, it was estimated that iOS 8.4 adoption hit 40 percent of compatible devices after just one week of availability. Apple Music launched at the end of June as part of iOS 8.4.\nLending credence to today's claims are remarks from Apple CEO Tim Cook, who last week during the company's third quarter conference call told investors that \"millions and millions\" have signed up for Apple Music's three-month trial. It remains to be seen whether trial users will make the jump to a paid single or family tier, or discontinue the service altogether.\nThe number compare favorably to competing streaming services like Spotify, which boasts about 20 million paying subscribers. Apple still has a ways to go before reaching Spotify's 75 million total active users or Pandora's 79.4 million. Unlike those services, which include metrics for free-to-stream tiers, Apple Music is completely subscription based.",

        "title": "The Apple Watch Review",
        "body": "Prior to the launch of the Apple Watch, there had been rumors that Apple would make a watch for quite some time. In a broader sense, the wearables industry has become an area of significant interest as the next growth market after devices like tablets and smartphones as the high-end market became saturated and much of the growth that previously existed in the mobile space started to level out. This has resulted in a new alignment of markets and technology; the markets are ripe for a new device to recapture the wild growth of smartphones, and in the 8 years since the launch of the iPhone the inexorable march of Moore's Law has seen another 4 generations of improvements in technology. This time is finally right, it seems, to take a crack at something even smaller and more personal than the smartphone: the watch.\nAbout two years ago, we put out our first wearable review, which examined Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Gear. In the time since then, Android Wear has been launched, with numerous OEMs launching some form of wearable using Google\u2019s wearable OS. However, Apple remained curiously absent from the field despite numerous rumors suggesting that Apple would soon launch a wearable. Last year, Apple announced the Apple Watch, but it wasn\u2019t until just a few months ago that it finally went on sale.\nConsequently, Apple didn\u2019t get a first-movers advantage getting into wearables, though it remains to be seen whether that would even matter. As the creator of the iPhone and frequently on the cutting edge of technology and design, Apple had enough good will with the public to be late, and at the same time with all eyes on them they could not afford to screw up. The end result is that though by no means a slight towards Apple\u2019s competitors, there is a clear distinction between everything that has come before the Apple Watch and everything that will come after. For the consumer market as a whole, the launch of the Apple Watch signifies that wearables have moved beyond the early adopter phase for techies, and are now being pitched at (and purchased by) the wider consumer market.\nNormally, it\u2019s easy enough to jump straight into what the device is and what\u2019s new about said device, but in the case of the Apple Watch it\u2019s really important that we explore the world in which this watch exists. The world is divided into people that wear watches, and people that don\u2019t. Apple faces the distinct problem is trying to sell to both audiences, which have very different desires from a watch. The people that already have watches don\u2019t want to give up the almost infinite battery life of conventional watches, high levels of water resistance, or anything else that is an accepted standard for watches.\nThe people that don\u2019t wear watches are probably the closest thing to a clean slate that we\u2019ll get when it comes to the wearable market. On a personal note, I fall into this camp, as I pretty much grew up in the age of widespread cellphone adoption. One of the convenient things about a phone is that they usually have the time on them, along with alarm and timer functionality. For me, this effectively meant that there was no point to wearing a watch. I also tended to have problems with the logistics involved in wearing a watch. In general, wristbands had an amazing tendency to either be too tight or too loose no matter how I adjusted the band. These issues were also compounded with any sort of physical exertion, as sweat tended to collect under the band which made wearing a watch noticeably more uncomfortable. These ergonomic issues, combined with the lack of functionality in a watch, ultimately made me stop wearing watches. Even before cellphones, wall-mounted clocks were more than sufficient for me when it came to checking the time, although I suspect I was far too young for time to really matter all that much.\nOf course, I have been trying out various wearables over the course of the past few years. Although I didn\u2019t try LG\u2019s G Watch, I have been able to use the Pebble Steel and Motorola\u2019s Moto 360. However, it was really a challenge for me to find anything to say about these wearables. They could definitely tell the time, and they had some extra functionality, but many of the same problems remained. The wearables I tested just weren\u2019t all that comfortable to wear, and due to some technology limitations both weren\u2019t really all that compelling to use. They could manage notifications, but other than that I found the functionality to be rather lacking. I often would forget to put them on at all before setting out for the day, and when I did I didn\u2019t feel any particular need to go back to put it on my wrist. After a few months, I completely forgot about these wearables and stopped wearing them. At the time, I honestly felt like wearables could end up being another passing fad because it seemed most wearables faced similar barriers in terms of getting people to keep wearing them. Wearables like Fitbit suffered from a pretty significant abandonment rate, and given that I did the same for both the Pebble Steel and Moto 360 it increasingly felt like this would be a persistent problem.\nIn this context, it seems easy for Apple to fail. Generally speaking, no one has really figured out how to solve the problem of wearable adoption, chiefly because the functionality offered often wasn\u2019t very compelling, and broadly speaking these wearables were often not well-designed. One of the first places we can start with the Apple Watch is the spec sheet. We can speak in empty platitudes about how specs don\u2019t matter, but in the case of something like Apple Watch they definitely will. The right components won\u2019t ensure success, but the wrong components can ensure a poor user experience.\nApple Watch 38mm Apple Watch 42mm SoC Apple S1 520MHz CPU Apple S1 520MHz CPU RAM/NAND 512MB LPDDR3(?)\n8GB NAND 512MB LPDDR3(?)\n8GB NAND Display 1.32\u201d 272x340 LG POLED 1.5\u201d 312x390 LG POLED Dimensions 38.6 x 33.3 x 10.5mm,\n25/40/55/54 grams\n(Sport/Watch/Gold/Rose Gold) 42 x 35.9 x 10.5mm,\n30/50/69/67 grams\n(Sport/Watch/Gold/Rose Gold) Battery 205 mAh (0.78 Whr) 246 mAh (0.93 Whr) OS WatchOS 1 WatchOS 1 Connectivity 802.11/b/g/n + BT 4.0, NFC 802.11/b/g/n + BT 4.0, NFC Price $349/549/10,000 (Sport/Watch/Edition) $399/599/12,000 (Sport/Watch/Edition)\nAs we can see, Apple has elected for some relatively conservative specifications. The SoC is relatively low power in nature, and the amount of RAM is probably about right for the kinds of tasks that a wearable will be used for at this time. The display is also of a decent resolution given the display size, and all the necessary wireless connectivity is present. It is notable that Apple is using a relatively small battery, but I suspect that this is necessary in order to fit all of the hardware into the casing of the watch. At least at a high level, it looks like Apple has put the right components into this wearable. However, it's going to take a deep examination of both technology and design to really figure out if Apple has avoided the pitfalls that I've discussed. One of the first and most obvious places to go first is the industrial and material design, which is what we'll talk about next.",

        "title": "New Apple TV to be unveiled in September but without TV subscription service",
        "body": "According to a new report from BuzzFeed News, Apple is currently planning to unveil its refreshed Apple TV in September. The company had originally planned to unveil the device at WWDC this summer, but scrapped it from the event at the last minute. A September unveil has seemingly been expected since the announcement was pulled from WWDC.\nThe report goes on to corroborate much of what we reported earlier this year. The refreshed Apple TV is expected to be slimmer than the current-generation device and will feature Apple\u2019s new A8 chip. The device will also feature a new remote with a touchpad, as we reported earlier this year. On the software side of things, the device will feature a refreshed interface with support for the long-awaited App Store.\nThe new Apple TV will support Apple Music, as well. Earlier this year it was reported that the company was also planning to launch a web TV service this fall, but BuzzFeed\u2019s report today claims that Apple is not yet ready to unveil the streaming TV service alongside the new Apple TV and will most likely push it until 2016. The Apple TV is also expected to gain Siri voice search support in its update this fall, as well as more on-board storage.\nIt was reported in the past that the device will not feature support for 4k content, as Apple feels there is not a large enough market for the feature at this time.",

        "title": "Opinion: iTunes is now so clunky the only safe solution is to nuke it from orbit",
        "body": "I\u2019ve complained before about the massive missed opportunity of Apple failing to properly integrate both owned and streamed music within iTunes. I got over that enough to use and enjoy Apple Music, and I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll be continuing my subscription once Apple starts charging my card, despite the raw deal we get on pricing in the UK.\nBut I also agreed with Variety that Apple needed to adopt the same approach for OS X as it does for iOS, splitting out the various iTunes functions into separate apps. Having now been using version 12.2 of iTunes for a month, I\u2019m escalating this from a moderate whinge to a full-scale rant. The time has come for Apple to finally rid us of this creaking, bloated disaster of an app, and start afresh \u2026\nDon\u2019t misunderstand me: I happen to rather like iTunes as a music player. I like the ability to view my music as albums, artists and songs. Visually, the way albums open out into color-matched track listings is attractive.\nI like the user-interface of the Now Playing list. It\u2019s easy to add entire albums or individual tracks, and simple to reorder them. I like the ability to pick a single track and, in one two-finger tap, tell iTunes to play that next before continuing with the tracks already in the queue.\nI like Smart Playlists. The breathtaking number of options available for user-created Smart Playlists is incredibly powerful \u2013 and can be a great way to resurface music you haven\u2019t listened to for a long time.\nI love Genius: my usual way to listen to my own music is to pick a track, create a Genius playlist and play that. Usually I delete these after playing them, but keep the ones I like. Genius can be a little repetitive \u2013 a number of different tracks generate very similar playlists \u2013 but it\u2019s still my favorite feature.\nOf course, iTunes isn\u2019t perfect, even as a music player. I like album art, and when an album is playing I like to display the cover using the Cover Version visualizer. But Apple\u2019s cover art graphics are so low-resolution they are horribly pixellated:\nThe Genre view is also a disaster, as it virtually has one category per album. But, in the main, it\u2019s a very good music player.\nOther media\nBut it\u2019s a different matter where other media is concerned. Where are podcasts, for example? Where are audiobooks? Ok, we\u2019re techies, we know that if we can\u2019t see something in a visible menu, it\u2019ll be hidden inside that \u2018\u2026\u2019 icon, but we\u2019re not short of space in the menu bar here, so why do we have Music, Movies and TV Shows visible, but not Podcasts and Audiobooks?\nAnd Apple hasn\u2019t even tried to integrate ye olde Internet Radio with Apple Music Radio \u2013 they are in completely different places.\nSyncing\nThings get even messier with syncing. Horribly messy. It\u2019s not like syncing was a great experience prior to the launch of Apple Music: despite the fact that I have both iPhone and iPad set to sync via WiFi, both devices randomly appear and disappear from the icon tab. Right now, as I write this, my iPad shows up but my iPhone doesn\u2019t:\nIf I\u2019d written it last night, it might have been the other way around. Sometimes both devices are there, sometimes one, sometimes the other \u2013 it\u2019s just extremely flakey. (Connecting it with a cable generally brings it back\u2026 for a while.)\nSometimes music would sync with my devices, sometimes it would simply fail with no clue why. Sometimes a device would disappear from iTunes midway through syncing.\nEven when it all worked properly, anyone new to iTunes is going to assume that to copy music to their device, they drag the music to their device and job done. Who, without painful experience of iTunes, would imagine that they need to follow this by switching to the device screen and clicking Sync for it to actually, you know, copy the music? It Just Works certainly does not apply.\nBut it\u2019s gotten much worse with Apple Music. Sure, I like iTunes Match giving me access to my entire music library via iCloud, and I like Apple Music giving me access to music I don\u2019t own \u2013 but that\u2019s no use when I\u2019m sitting on a plane, or in an area with poor data connectivity, so I like to have a decent stash of local music. Since iTunes 12.2, iTunes simply refuses to copy local music to my devices, even with \u2018Manually manage music and videos\u2019 checked.\nAnd by \u2018some,\u2019 it means \u2018all.\u2019\nWhat kind of error message is that anyway? It gives no clue what to do about it. Sure, I\u2019m a geek and I\u2019ve been using Apple products for a long time, so I was able to fix it after only a brief expletive, but how many non-tech users are going to realize that this means they need to open up Settings (not the Music app) on their iPad, scroll down to Music and then flick the iCloud Music Library switch to \u2018off\u2019? None at all, that\u2019s how many.\nAnd why on earth can\u2019t I add my own locally-stored music to play whether or not I have a data connection, plus access to Apple Music when I do? It makes no sense at all for this to be an either/or. Especially as I\u2019m pretty sure it let me do this before a hardware failure meant getting my iPad replaced. (Which is another complaint about lack of integration in the Apple ecosystem: since I\u2019m restoring from iCloud Backup, and all my music is on iTunes Match, why doesn\u2019t my music get re-downloaded as part of the restore?)\nI haven\u2019t experienced the nightmare Jim Dalrymple described of somehow seeing 4,700 songs disappear, but I have seen small numbers of tracks disappear from my Mac, courtesy of this error message when syncing albums I know are (or were \u2026) on my machine:\nOf course, I have multiple backups, but deleting music is still a pretty major screw-up.\nSpeaking of which, why for the love of all things tech would syncing books remove all music, movies and TV shows?\nWhat about photos? iCloud may (eventually) sync photos taken with your iPhone to your iPad and Mac, but what if you want to manually copy across photos taken with a DSLR to your iPad to easily share with friends? Give any of your bright but non-tech friends a folder of photos, an iPad and a copy of iTunes and see if any of them can figure out how to do it without losing their existing synced photos. Hell, try it with some techy ones too.\nI could go on, but tl;dr: iTunes is a total mess \u2013 about as far from an It Just Works experience as you could possibly get, and an utter embarrassment for a company which prides itself on simple, intuitive user interfaces. It needs to die, and be replaced with individual OS X apps which each do one job, and do it well.\nIndividual apps\nLet\u2019s have a new OS X Music app just like we got a new iOS one. Have it be a music player, and a means of transferring music to iOS devices, and nothing else. Strip away absolutely everything that isn\u2019t about music.\nFix all the bugs. Replace the obtuse error messages with helpful ones that tell you how to resolve the issue (but only where you can\u2019t stop the problem from occurring in the first place). Provide high-res album art. Fix the genres.\nLet users have any mix of local and streamed music they choose, and lose the two-step transfer process for local music \u2013 when you drag music to a device, copy it there, immediately. In short, make an OS X Music app that Just Works.\nWe already have iBooks for books, there\u2019s no reason to even see books in iTunes when iBooks can do the syncing perfectly well. Pull out Podcasts into their own app, exactly as per iOS. Ditto Audiobooks, iTunes U, Apps and Tones: give each their own lightweight, totally intuitive app. And, of course, give each a consistent user interface.\nWhen all that is done, collect all the drives containing the iTunes source code, put them on the lawn in front of 1 Infinite Loop and auction off the right to have at \u2019em with an angle grinder. That would raise way more money for charity than a lunch with Tim Cook.\nDo you share my views? Take the poll, and let us know your thoughts in the comments.",
