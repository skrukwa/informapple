        "body": "Article Hero Image\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nIn a surprise release on Tuesday, Apple debuted the Smart Battery Case for iPhone 6s and 6, the first integrated battery pack to come out of Cupertino since the original iPhone launched in 2007.\nAccording to the item's description, the Smart Battery Case is designed specifically for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 devices, offering users a high level of protection and up to 25 hours of extended usage.\nLike Apple's current lineup of custom-fit iPhone cases, the battery-packed version is made from soft touch silicone and comes lined with microfiber material. A special elastomer hinge design allows for easy insertion and removal, suggesting the case itself is somewhat pliable.\nA small \"chin\" section houses the Lightning connector and what appears to be acoustic channels for iPhone's speaker and microphone. Importantly, a female Lightning port is built in to the case bottom, meaning iPhone owners connect their favorite Lightning accessories or charge iPhone and the Smart Battery Case simultaneously. Apple points out compatibility with the official Lightning dock.\nUnlike popular third-party designs that effectively double iPhone's sleek profile, like Mophie's Juice Pack, Apple chose to stuff the external battery into a small hump. Cutouts along the edges and case back provide access to iPhone's iSight camera, mute switch and headphone jack, while system volume controls and sleep/wake button remain snugly covered.\nApple fails to specify exact battery capacity information, but claims talk times can increase up to 25 hours, Internet browsing over LTE up to 18 hours, and audio and video playback up to 20 hours.\nWhen attached and charging iPhone, users can quickly check the pack's power status through a special lock screen graphic and in Notification Center's Batteries section.\nGerman language site iPhone-ticker.de also reported on Apple's Smart Battery Case launch.",

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\nApple has launched a scathing attack on the Government\u2019s plans to give spies more powers.\nThe company has said in a rare public statement that it believes that Theresa May\u2019s Investigatory Powers Bill would make the \u201cpersonal data of millions of law abiding citizens [\u2026] less secure\u201d.\nThe Government intends to bring in the Investigatory Powers Bill as soon as possible, to bring new powers to help intelligence agencies and law enforcement to conduct surveillance. But the legislation has been repeatedly criticised for over-reaching, and apparently banning some of the most central parts of modern technology.\nApple argues that the legislation should be re-written to be more clear about how the powers that are contained within it will be used. It made the statement as part of its submission to the joint scrutiny committee for the Investigatory Powers Bill.\n\"We believe there is a need for much greater clarity as to how the powers in the bill will be applied,\u201d Apple\u2019s submission reads. \u201cNot least because, once again, the [powers] could endanger the privacy and security of users in the UK and elsewhere.\"\nApple\u2019s criticisms centre around three key parts of the bill.\nThe first is that it requires that companies can break their own security measures so that messages can be more easily read.\nEncryption \u2013 which can be found in Apple\u2019s iMessage and FaceTime messaging services \u2013 uses mathematical techniques to ensure that a message can only be read by the person it was sent to. But parts of the bill seem to suggest that technology should be broken open, so that messages can\u2019t be kept from intelligence agencies.\nGadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25 1 / 25 Gadget and tech news: In pictures Gadget and tech news: In pictures Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into space Russia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The bad guys would find it too.\"\nApple\u2019s second criticism is that the law contains measures that would force companies like Apple to help the government to hack into phones so that information can be taken from them. The company points out that this will \u201cextend responsibility for hacking from Government to the private sector\u201d, and that it will undermine trust between technology companies and their users.\nBecause Apple sends the same version of its software to every user, wherever they are, the company would have to build those hacking and interception capabilities into every phone that it sells. That would mean that the same weaknesses could be used by governments and other bodies across the world, including in areas with much lesser safeguards or less strong human rights records.\nFinally, the company objects to the international aspects of the law, which allow it to apply extraterritorially. That means that Apple and other companies will have to abide by the law despite being based elsewhere, potentially putting it into conflict with other local laws.\nApple\u2019s Tim Cook has spoken out publicly about safeguards for privacy and security, including comments about the Investigatory Powers Bill made in recent interviews. But the public criticism is an unusual step for the company itself, which has in the past rarely made statements about legislation or policy.\nNew legislation will have to be passed by the end of 2016, in part because existing laws will run out by the end of next year.\nBut Apple\u2019s primary suggestion is that the bill should be re-written to provide more clarity about the more contested parts of the legislation.",

OpenEmu 2.0 redesigns the user interface, adds real-time rewinding for gameplay, can organize screenshots and save-states, adds more than 80 homebrew games, and makes other improvements. But the biggest reason to update is that the front end now features support for 16 new consoles, including early 3D systems like the Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation.\nThe full list of consoles (and the emulator \"cores\" that are actually handling the heavy lifting) are all listed below.\nAtari 5200 (Atari800)\nAtari 7800 (ProSystem)\nAtari Lynx (Mednafen)\nColecoVision (CrabEmu)\nFamicom Disk System (Nestopia)\nIntellivision (Bliss)\nNintendo 64 (Mupen64Plus)\nOdyssey\u00b2/Videopac+ (O2EM)\nPC-FX (Mednafen)\nSG-1000 (CrabEmu)\nSega CD (GenesisPlus)\nSony PSP (PPSSPP)\nSony PlayStation (Mednafen)\nTurboGrafx-CD/PCE-CD (Mednafen)\nVectrex (VecXGL)\nWonderSwan (Mednafen)\nThose wanting to play disc-based games will be pointed to this section of the user guide, which outlines the specific formats that your game backups need to be stored in.

We take your satisfaction and support seriously, and hope you can understand the choice we have made. There are a number of reasons for Sketch leaving the Mac App Store \u2014 many of which in isolation wouldn\u2019t cause us huge concern. However as with all gripes, when compounded they make it hard to justify staying: App Review continues to take at least a week, there are technical limitations imposed by the Mac App Store guidelines (sandboxing and so on) that limit some of the features we want to bring to Sketch, and upgrade pricing remains unavailable. We should also add that this move is not a knee-jerk reaction to the recent certificate expiration problems that affected so many Mac App Store customers. However, in light of what happened, we can\u2019t help but feel vindicated in our decision that the Mac App Store is not in our customers\u2019 best interests right now.\nDeeply troubling indictment of the Mac App Store. Sketch isn\u2019t the first big name professional app to be pulled from the Mac App Store (Bare Bones Software\u2019s BBEdit, Panic\u2019s Coda, Quicken, just to name a few). But Sketch is the poster child for Mac App Store era professional Mac software. It\u2019s the sort of app Apple might demo in a keynote \u2014 and the winner of an Apple Design Award. Apple thinks so highly of it that they provide Sketch templates for Apple Watch UI designers. It\u2019s incredibly popular (and was among the top-grossers on the Mac App Store), Mac-only, and they want no part of the Mac App Store.\nThe Mac App Store should be designed to make developers like Bohemian Coding (and Bare Bones, and Panic, etc.) happy. It should make developing for the Mac better, not worse than selling outside the App Store. These are among the best apps on the platform, from developers who have been loyal to Apple and the Mac for decades.\nThe Mac App Store is rotting, at least for productivity software. There\u2019s no other way to put it. If this hasn\u2019t set off alarm bells within Apple, something is very wrong.\n\u2605 Tuesday, 1 December 2015",

        "body": "Apple was the subject of a wide ranging but not very hard hitting 60 Minutes segment on Sunday night. Charlie Rose steered the conversation through topics that Apple and its CEO Tim Cook have addressed repeatedly over the last few years. (Yeah, those Steve Jobs questions just keep coming.) But the episode did reveal one semi-interesting new detail: Apple now says there are 800 people solely dedicated to working on the iPhone's camera. That team of \"engineers and other specialists\" is led by Graham Townsend, who took Rose on a tour of the camera testing lab.\n\"There's over 200 separate individual parts\" in the iPhone's camera module, Townsend said. Then he demonstrated how Apple simulates various conditions to test out the camera's performance, from sunsets to lousy indoor lighting. \"We can simulate all those here,\" Townsend said. Apple's competitors certainly conduct many of those same tests, but the sheer size of Apple's camera team shows you how high up on the priority list it's risen. Apple has built entire ad campaigns around the iPhone's camera, and always makes it a point to highlight improvements with each new iPhone revision.\nGenerally, the interview lacked anything else noteworthy. At one point, marketing chief Phil Schiller addressed product cannibalization, but seemed pretty nonchalant about it. \"It's not a danger, it's almost by design,\" he said of Apple's products making other Apple products less appealing. \"You need each of these products to try to fight for their space, their time with you. The iPhone has to become so great that you don't know why you want an iPad. The iPad has to be so great that you don't know why you why you want a notebook. The notebook has to be so great, you don't know why you want a desktop. Each one's job is to compete with the other ones.\" As long as there's an Apple emblem somewhere on whichever you choose, the company seems okay with that.\nCBS previewed tonight's interview on Friday with a short clip covering accusations that Apple skimps on taxes surrounding its billions in overseas revenue. A visibly frustrated Tim Cook told host Charlie Rose that Apple \"pays every tax dollar we owe\" \u2014 more than any other company in the United States. Claims that Apple is scheming to evade US taxes are \"total political crap,\" the CEO said. Cook acknowledged that Apple keeps billions of dollars outside US borders, but said it's necessary due to an antiquated and \"backwards\" tax code. \"It's awful for America,\" Cook said. \"It should have been fixed many years ago. It's past time to get it done.\"",

        "title": "Lawsuit seeks more than $5M from Apple for slowing older iPhones with iOS 9 upgrade",
        "body": "Article Hero Image\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nA class action lawsuit lodged with a New York district court on Tuesday dredges up claims that Apple engages in planned obsolescence, saying the company knew of potential compatibility issues when it foisted its latest iOS 9 software update on iPhone 4s owners.\nPlaintiff Chaim Lerman asserts Apple engaged in deceptive trade practices and false advertisement by touting iOS 9 as compatible with legacy handsets dating back to iPhone 4s models. In actuality, the complaint reads, iOS 9 significantly interferes with iPhone 4s performance, and because Apple security protocols prevent users from downgrading, owners were forced to choose between an inoperable device or spending hundreds of dollars on a new version.\nThe class, which includes more than 100 members, asserts iOS 9 bogged down their iPhone 4s devices to the point of being unfit for daily use. After upgrading, both first- and third-party apps exhibited delayed launch times, slow response to touchscreen input and other problems. Overall performance became sluggish, while some users, including Lerman, reported freezes and crash events.\nThe lawsuit goes on to claim that Apple, through \"internal testing and/or through other means,\" was well aware of iOS 9's negative impact on iPhone 4s functionality. Despite this knowledge, the company went through with a broad marketing campaign advertising faster performance, enhanced security, longer battery life and other enticing features. Further, the company's ads, website and iOS update page fail to warn owners of older hardware, specifically iPhone 4s devices, of potential compatibility issues.\nThe complaint goes after Apple's iOS ecosystem itself, saying users are more likely to buy a newer device than switch away to a competing platform because of non-transferrable investments like apps. It is also argued that Apple stands to profit from new cellular carrier contract agreements, but those claims were not fully fleshed out.\nPlaintiffs are seeking over $5 million in damages with an option to treble.\nAs with every annual iOS update, iOS 9 was designed to take full advantage of Apple's latest hardware, in this case iPhone 6s. Aside from iPhone 6s-specific features like 3D Touch, iOS 9 is built to push Apple's class-leading A9 system-on-chip, a much more capable version of its 32-bit, dual-core A5 ancestor found in iPhone 4s.\nWhile legacy handsets are technically compatible with iOS 9, older hardware is simply incapable of performing on a par with iPhone 6s. By definition, next-generation software is limited in its support of last-generation hardware. The case, then, in part argues Apple has a responsibility to protect consumers who are unfamiliar with rapidly evolving computer technology, or by extension consumer markets.\nApple faced similar accusations in 2011 from plaintiffs in a class action complaint who claimed iOS 4 turned their iPhone 3G into \"iBricks.\" The case was tossed a year later, though the topic of planned obsolescence continues to crop up with nearly every significant Apple release.",

        "title": "Apple's Tim Cook defends encryption. When will other tech CEOs do so?",
        "body": "It seems everywhere he goes these days, Apple CEO Tim Cook is out there forcefully and publicly defending his company\u2019s decision to provide iPhone users with end-to-end text messaging and FaceTime encryption to protect against the constant threat of criminal hackers and foreign governments. The question is: when will other tech company leaders follow his lead?\nIf we\u2019re going to avoid having a horrible law banning encryption passed in the next year, more of the tech company giants\u2019 high-profile representatives \u2013 the Mark Zuckerbergs, Marissa Mayers and Eric Schmidts \u2013 need to use their platforms as the world\u2019s most well-known technology chiefs to make crystal clear how important encryption is to users everywhere.\nUS and UK officials have not let up on their months-long PR blitz villainizing encryption in an attempt to force tech companies to provide a surveillance backdoor into their products. This, despite the fact that officials still haven\u2019t produced any evidence that encryption was involved in the planning of any of the recent attacks in Paris and San Bernardino.\nNot that it should matter; even if terrorists do use encrypted communications apps there are plenty of ways to track them and plenty of reasons to still encourage the technology\u2019s use. On 60 Minutes earlier this week, Cook explained why encryption is so important and why installing backdoors for government access to everyone\u2019s communications is such a bad idea:\nHere\u2019s what the situation is on your smartphone today, on your iPhone, there\u2019s likely health information, there\u2019s financial information. There are intimate conversations with your family, or your co-workers. There\u2019s probably business secrets and you should have the ability to protect it. And the only way we know how to do that, is to encrypt it. Why is that? It\u2019s because if there\u2019s a way to get in, then somebody will find the way in. There have been people that suggest that we should have a back door. But the reality is if you put a back door in, that back doors for everybody, for good guys and bad guys.\nUnfortunately, Cook is badly outnumbered by an onslaught of ignorant politicians making misleading and false statements about how encryption works and why we should ban it. And it isn\u2019t just a problem in the US and the UK: all over the world countries are grappling with their sudden loss of power to surveil everything their citizenry says or does. A judge in Brazil briefly ordered Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp messaging application be blocked across the entire country because the service has no way of decrypting a suspect\u2019s communications.\nThankfully the court backed down, but in his statement on that ruling, Mark Zuckerberg did not even mention the word \u201cencryption\u201d, let alone explain why it\u2019s so important that every user be given this protection even if it means that the government can never access the content. Other tech companies, while they rightfully oppose the government\u2019s push to ban encryption, have not been nearly as vocal in public as Apple, in many cases speaking through privately through lobbyists or industry representatives.\nThat\u2019s not to say these companies aren\u2019t doing anything: they\u2019ve all released statements at various points condemning attacks on encryption; Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp has brought end-to-end encryption to more people \u2013 over 800 million \u2013 than any other service; and Google\u2019s engineering team has been a leader in securing much of the web in the post-Snowden era.\nBut this is much more than an engineering fight \u2013 it\u2019s a political one where public opinion is crucial. And if the CEOs of these tech companies and their highest-profile representatives aren\u2019t out there every day loudly fighting for our right to encryption where millions of people can hear them, then it\u2019s quite likely we might wake up one day and find that the US or UK has passed some awful bill, which will only encourage China to do the same \u2013 and very soon half the world may try to outlaw encryption in some way, shape or form.",

        "title": "Dropbox is shutting Mailbox down - any suggestions on your favorite mail clients to replace it?",
        "body": "Dropbox is doing away with Mailbox, the email app it acquired in March 2013, and Carousel, the company's attempt at a standalone photo management app. The company says that it's making this decision now to focus more directly on the primary Dropbox app and the collaborative features it's known for. \"The Carousel and Mailbox teams have built products that are loved by many people and their work will continue to have an impact,\" wrote Dropbox's founder / CEO Drew Houston and CTO Arash Ferdowsi in a blog post. \"We\u2019ll be taking key features from Carousel back to the place where your photos live \u2014 in the Dropbox app. We\u2019ll also be using what we\u2019ve learned from Mailbox to build new ways to communicate and collaborate on Dropbox.\"\nMailbox will shut down on February 26th, with Carousel following the next month on March 31st. Dropbox says it's giving Carousel extra time so that users can download their photos and move them elsewhere if they so choose. \"If you have conversations or shared albums you want to save from Carousel, we\u2019ll provide a simple export tool early next year,\" the company notes.\nBoth apps have seen little development in recent months, allowing competition from bigger rivals to move ahead of Dropbox's software. Mailbox was effectively abandoned on both iOS and Android months ago, and even the Twitter account has gone silent. Other third-party email apps like Microsoft's Outlook and Google Inbox have built upon the unique swipe and time management features that Mailbox introduced. The company acknowledges as much, saying \"many of its innovations are now ubiquitous across the industry.\"\nSimilarly, Google Photos and Apple Photos have made Dropbox's Carousel app somewhat useless by comparison. Dropbox says it'll bring some of Carousel's better features to the main app \"in the coming months.\" So there's the closure you might've been looking for; it just would've been nice to see this happen a few months sooner.",

It\u2019s unknown which specific services have secured the deal, though sources strongly suggest that most, if not all, will have access to the band\u2019s catalog of studio albums next week.

Apple, Tidal, Deezer and Slacker did not immediately return a request for comment.\nThe Beatles as an entity has been notoriously slow in adopting and adapting to new technology \u2014 it took the band six years to arrive on the iTunes Store, selling two million songs during its first week. The group took 25 years, since its breakup in 1970, to issue the comprehensive Anthology documentary. It didn\u2019t get involved with video games until The Beatles: Rock Band was released in 2009. The Beatles music was released on CD in 1987, but the band didn\u2019t remaster their work until 22 years later.\nThe group joins the streaming revolution just as music consumption on such platforms has begun to officially overtake downloads in revenue generation for major labels. They\u2019ve sold 178 million albums in the U.S., according to the RIAA.\nIt\u2019s not as though the group needs the exposure.

That's up from 4 percent in 2013 and 13 percent in 2014. Full-sized tablets have gone down in popularity, making up only 9 percent of new device activations in 2015.\nMedium-sized iPhones like the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 were still the most popular Apple devices over the holiday period at 65 percent, followed by full-sized tablets, phablets, and smaller tablets like the iPad mini. Comparatively, only 35 percent of Android devices activated were medium-sized smartphones, while 50 percent were phablets.\nApple's phablet was introduced in September 2014, and in less than a year and a half has commanded 12% share of all Apple devices activated during Christmas week. This appears to be coming at the expense of medium phones and small tablets as more users opt for the size in between the iPhone and iPad Mini. You'll note we did not break out a \"Large Tablet\" category for the new iPad Pro. These are grouped into \"Full-Size Tablets\" and represented less than 1% of device activations.\nAs for app downloads, Christmas day saw customers downloading 2.2x as many apps as the average day in December across multiple platforms including the Apple App Store and Android's Google Play.\nTo gather its data, Flurry measured smart device activations and app downloads from the more than 780,000 apps it tracks.

Though it is the second major update, iOS 9.2 is actually the fourth update to iOS 9 in total, following the launches of iOS 9.0.1, iOS 9.0.2, and iOS 9.1. Xcode 7.2 is also available today.\niOS 9.2 includes a huge list of bug fixes, which we've outlined below.\nThis update contains improvements and bug fixes including: - Apple Music improvements\n--You can now create a new playlist when adding a song to a playlist\n--Your most recently changed playlist is now listed at the top when adding songs to playlists\n--Download albums or playlists from your iCloud Music Library by tapping the iCloud download button\n--See which songs have been downloaded with the new download indicator next to each song in My Music and Playlists\n--See works, composers, and performers while browsing Classical music in the Apple Music catalog\n- A new Top Stories section in News so you can stay up to date with the most important news of the day (available in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia)\n- Mail Drop in Mail for sending large attachments\n- iBooks now supports 3D Touch to peek and pop pages from the table of contents, your notes and bookmarks, or from search results inside a book\n- iBooks now supports listening to an audiobook while you browse your library, read other books, or explore the iBooks Store\n- iPhone support for the USB Camera Adapter to import photos and videos\n- Improved stability of Safari\n- Improved stability of Podcasts\n- Fixing an issue that caused mail attachments to be inaccessible for some users with POP email accounts\n- Resolving an issue for some users that caused attachments to overlap text in mail\n- Fixing an issue where Live Photos could have turned off after restoring from a previous iCloud backup\n- Addressing an issue that could cause search in Contacts to display no results\n- Resolving an issue that could have prevented Calendar from displaying all seven days in week view\n- Fixing an issue where Camera screen on iPad could be black when attempting to capture video\n- Addressing an issue that could cause instability in the Activity app when viewing the day of Daylight Savings Time transition\n- Fixing an issue that could prevent data from appearing in Health\n- Fixing an issue that could prevent Wallet updates and Lock screen alerts from displaying\n- Addressing an issue where updating iOS could prevent an alarm from going off\n- Fixing an issue where some users were unable to login to Find my iPhone\n- Fixing an issue that prevented some manual iCloud Backups from completing\n- Addressing an issue where using the iPad keyboard could unintentionally trigger text selection mode\n- Improved keyboard responsiveness when using Quick Reply\n- Improved punctuation input on the 10-key Chinese (Pinyin & Stroke) keyboards with new expanded view of punctuation symbols and better predictions\n- Fixing an issue on Cyrillic keyboards where caps lock would be enabled when typing in URL or email fields\n- Siri support for Arabic (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates)\n- Accessibility improvements\n--Fixing issues with VoiceOver when using Camera face detection\n--Adding support for VoiceOver to wake up the screen\n--Adding support for VoiceOver to invoke app switcher with 3D Touch gesture\n--Fixing an issue with Guided Access when trying to end phone calls\n--Improved functionality for Switch Control users when using 3D Touch\n--Fixing an issue with speech rate of Speak Screen\nBeyond bug fixes, iOS 9.2's biggest change is a tweak to the way the Safari View Controller works within third-party apps.

        "body": "AT&T's long affair with the two-year contract continues to wind down, Engadget has learned. According to an internal document sent to employees this morning, new and existing customers will only be able to get new phones by paying the full price upfront or in installments over time. The move is set to take effect on January 8th, so you'd better act fast if you (for some reason) really want to lock yourself down for a few more years.\nJust to be perfectly clear, this move applies to all of AT&T's phones. Once the new year rolls around, even flip phones and non-smartphones with keyboards (what AT&T likes to call \"Quick Messaging Devices\") must be bought outright or with an installment plan. What's less clear is the status of wearables like the Samsung Gear S2 and tablets, which are currently sold (and promoted heavily) with two-year contracts. It's also possible (if not likely) that AT&T will keep multi-year contracts around for large corporate accounts, and we're looking into both situations. AT&T's vague, highly vetted statement says the change is being made for the sake of \"aligning... service offerings with customer and industry trends\". Well, we can't argue with that. While smaller, scrappier carriers like T-Mobile have already bailed on the multi-year contract model, AT&T has been slower to act.\nThis June, the company stopped offering contracts for smartphones to customers through local dealers and partner retailers like Best Buy and Apple. The option to ink a contract remained for people who bought basic phones or went straight to an AT&T store and asked specifically for a contract extension. The message? Payment plans like AT&T Next were the future. That sentiment was echoed when Verizon stopped pushing two-year contracts a few months later. The thing is, people who had those contracts could keep them and still get subsidized phones if they wanted \u2014 an option that won't be available to AT&T customers. Still have questions?

It's backwards. It's awful for America. It should have been fixed many years ago. It's past time to get it done.\"\nAfter he testified before Congress in 2013, some politicians concluded that Apple was involved in a \"scheme\" to pay little or no taxes to the U.S. When questioned about that conclusion by Rose, Cook responded fiercely.\n\"That is total political crap,\" he said. \"There is no truth behind it.
