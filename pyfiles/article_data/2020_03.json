        "body": "Mar. 27th 2020 4:59 am\nUpdate: The app has now been updated to remove this data transfer. See below for an explanation from the company.\nThe Zoom iOS app is sharing data with Facebook, without declaring it in the privacy policy. This happens whether or not you have a Facebook account.\nData shared with Facebook includes your iPhone or iPad model, your time-zone, city, phone carrier and a unique identifier which can be used for ad-targeting \u2026\nThe discovery was made by Motherboard and confirmed by iOS security researcher Will Strafach.\nUpon downloading and opening the app, Zoom connects to Facebook\u2019s Graph API, according to Motherboard\u2019s analysis of the app\u2019s network activity. The Graph API is the main way developers get data in or out of Facebook [\u2026] Zoom is not forthcoming with the data collection or the transfer of it to Facebook. Zoom\u2019s policy says the company may collect user\u2019s \u201cFacebook profile information (when you use Facebook to log-in to our Products or to create an account for our Products),\u201d but doesn\u2019t explicitly mention anything about sending data to Facebook on Zoom users who don\u2019t have a Facebook account at all.\nThe piece notes that it\u2019s not uncommon for apps to use a Facebook SDK.\nThis sort of data transfer is not uncommon, especially for Facebook; plenty of apps use Facebook\u2019s software development kits (SDK) as a means to implement features into their apps more easily, which also has the effect of sending information to Facebook.\nWhat is not permitted by Facebook, however, is to do this without notifying users.\nZoom users may not be aware it is happening, nor understand that when they use one product, they may be providing data to another service altogether [\u2026] Facebook told Motherboard it requires developers to be transparent with users about the data their apps send to Facebook. Facebook\u2019s terms say \u201cIf you use our pixels or SDKs, you further represent and warrant that you have provided robust and sufficiently prominent notice to users regarding the Customer Data collection, sharing and usage,\u201d and specifically for apps, \u201cthat third parties, including Facebook, may collect or receive information from your app and other apps and use that information to provide measurement services and targeted ads.\u201d\nZoom is seeing record use during the coronavirus crisis, as both businesses and consumers use it to keep in touch via group video calls.\nIt\u2019s not the first time there has been a privacy issue with Zoom. A major vulnerability last year meant that websites were able to activate Mac webcams without first asking permission. And it was recently suggested that the host can monitor other apps in use, though this appears to apply only to corporately-managed machines.\nSee more Everyone working remotely: ZOOM monitors the activity on your computer and collects data on the programs running and captures which window you have focus on. If you manage the calls, you can monitor what programs users on the call are running as well.

We originally implemented the \u2018Login with Facebook\u2019 feature using the Facebook SDK in order to provide our users with another convenient way to access our platform.

        "body": "The Apple Watch is widely considered to be the best smartwatch out there, even though it doesn\u2019t work with Android phones. Personally, I had never used an Apple Watch until a couple weeks ago when I started using our Series 5 unit as my smartwatch of choice with my iPhone.\nAs one would expect, everything works great and in tandem between this watch and my phone, and it\u2019s all great. However, I\u2019ve had many people come up to me asking why the Apple Watch doesn\u2019t come with sleep tracking built in. After all, it is a feature you\u2019d find in almost every smartwatch out there, even on fitness bands. After thinking about that for a bit, and having used the watch for long enough to no longer be constantly amazed by things about it, I think the Apple Watch doesn\u2019t need sleep tracking to be built in until the battery life gets better.\nSo You Thought the Battery Life Was Good Enough?\nYou\u2019re not entirely wrong if that\u2019s the impression you have about the Apple Watch. The Series 5 I\u2019m using (GPS only) easily goes through the day with Always On Display turned on. That\u2019s when my usual day starts from around 7AM to 10PM. In that time, the watch is anywhere between 50 to 60% when I place it back on that magnetic cradle.\nThat\u2019s good. It\u2019s not great, and it\u2019s definitely not enough to be worn through the night because guess what, you need to wear it again the next day, so when exactly would you charge it?\nI won\u2019t blame you if you were thinking you could just charge it the next morning before heading out to work, but the Series 5 just doesn\u2019t charge fast enough.\nBy Apple\u2019s own testing, the Series 5 takes 1.5 hours to charge from 0 to 80%, and a total of 2.5 hours to go from 0 to 100%. Now I don\u2019t know about you, but it usually doesn\u2019t take me 2.5 hours to get ready for work.\nWhat If You Really Need Sleep Tracking?\nSure, there\u2019s an argument to be made about someone needing to keep a track of their sleeping habits, and considering the amount of attention Apple pays to making sure the Apple Watch is a great fitness companion (it really is), it seems like sleep tracking should be somewhere high-up on their to-do list for watchOS.\nWho knows, maybe Apple finally does bring sleep tracking to the Apple Watch with the Series 6 this year. Maybe. I don\u2019t think they should though.\nBefore Apple implements sleep tracking in the Apple Watch, the company needs to figure out one of two things (preferably both, actually):\nThe battery needs to last much longer, or,\nThe watch needs to charge considerably faster than it does.\nSee, if the battery on the Apple Watch lasted, say, 3 days, sleep tracking would be great. You wear your watch continuously for three days, including while you sleep, and then one night you let it charge. Sure you don\u2019t get sleep data for one night, but it\u2019s better than not getting sleep data ever.\nSecond, if the watch charged faster than it does, the current battery situation would resolve itself. You can wear the watch the whole day, sleep with it still on your wrist, and just charge it the next morning while you get ready for work (or play).\nThat\u2019s wishful thinking, and while I certainly hope Apple will figure out some way to get this done, I won\u2019t hold my breath for it, and I will definitely not be happy about the Apple Watch based on my own hopes for what the future holds for this product.\nAs of right now, if you really need sleep tracking on the Apple Watch, there are a bunch of apps you can go with. I would recommend Pillow (Free, with in-app purchases), or AutoSleep ($2.99 | \u20b9249) because these are the only two apps that have a nice design, and also automatically track sleep. You can also check out Sleep++ (download) which is completely free, doesn\u2019t look all that great, but gets the job done.\nApple Needs to Up the Apple Watch\u2019s Battery Life\nEverything said and done, I have to say I really love the Apple Watch, and it\u2019s not just based on the merits of this watch as a device (even though it has a lot of those individual merits), it\u2019s also because I am deep into the Apple ecosystem right now, and the Apple Watch works seamlessly with everything else I use.\nHeck, I\u2019m not even mad about the battery life because I don\u2019t really have a use for sleep tracking. That said, I would love not having to charge my watch every night, because that will be a nightmare on vacations or weekend trips. There are some tips that you can use to improve battery life on Apple Watch Series 6, but they are not enough if you want to get multi-day use out of it.\nLook, I don\u2019t know what Apple is planning to do with the Apple Watch Series 6 when it launches this fall, but I am hoping that if the company decides to add sleep tracking, they will also make major improvements in the battery department. Until then, I\u2019m happily sleeping off with my Series 5 on its charging cradle overnight, right along with my iPhone.",

        "title": "Apple allowing ads in push notifications is a path better left unwalked",
        "body": "Apple has recently updated its developer guidelines, and in particular, we should pay attention to the changes to the rules about notifications. Because they're pretty gross, and it's down a road that I wish Apple wouldn't walk.\nDevelopers will be able to use notifications for promotions or direct marketing thanks to changes to section 4.5.4.\nSection 4.5.4 (opens in new tab) now reads thusly:\n4.5.4 Push Notifications must not be required for the app to function, and should not be used to send sensitive personal or confidential information. Push Notifications should not be used for promotions or direct marketing purposes unless customers have explicitly opted in to receive them via consent language displayed in your app's UI, and you provide a method in your app for a user to opt out from receiving such messages. Abuse of these services may result in revocation of your privileges.\nLook, this really feels like a gut-check kind of thing, and my gut says allowing advertisement in notifications is gross. It's bad enough that Apple advertises using notifications in its own apps (especially when you're not a subscriber to its services), but to allow it for developers now just makes me uncomfortable.\nWe're overloaded with advertising these days. We don't need more of it, especially for a device that's on us all of the time. It's one thing to encounter a lot of ads on the web on, for instance, your Mac. To have them on a device that you always have with you, buzzing or beeping all of the time, is user-hostile.\nThere are sure to be developers out there who won't use this feature. And there are going to be developers who use it sparingly, or maybe even in inventive ways that enhance your experience. If a favorite game gets a new piece of content or puts something on sale, then sure, I wouldn't mind knowing about it.\nBut you and I both know you're going to see company after company tries to abuse this system. Sales, new content, oh, and did you remember to upgrade to a premium membership? You should really upgrade to a premium membership.\nNow, some might say that I'm overblowing this. After all, the new rules say that you can't send these notifications unless users have explicitly opted in. There needs to be explicit consent language and easy opt-out. Well, excuse me if I don't place my faith in an app review system that regularly gets its wires crossed.\nI'd put real money on bad actors slipping by these provisions. Maybe they'll be caught right away. Maybe they won't. Maybe it'll be a big company, like Facebook, who says, \"No, we're going to do it this way, and if you try and make us change it, we'll leave.\"\nBut also, people often just tap 'Yes' or 'Agreed' or 'Continue' on pop-ups on their phones. They don't read carefully enough. They'll permit these types of notifications, almost accidentally, and the next thing you know, they'll be spammed by the bad actors of the App Store that they've installed on their phone.\nMaybe they should read things more carefully. But the kind of people that will abuse this system know that they won't and they take advantage of that. A lot of people are impatient. It doesn't mean they deserve it when someone takes advantage of them because they didn't read the fine print.\nAnd what's to say that these rules won't be relaxed further somewhere down the road? Slippery slope arguments are a fallacy to be sure. Still, I think we've all be burned badly at least one time before by a company we trusted, so I don't think we can put complete faith in Apple here to hold this particular line, especially when they didn't even hold the previous line for themselves.\nThe world doesn't need additional opportunities to advertise to us. Keep it confined inside of your app. Opening this door is the wrong move by Apple, and I'm not excited to see how some developers will take advantage of it.\nBut what do you think? Do you take this as a bad sign, or are those among us worried about this just overblowing it? Let us know in the comments.",
