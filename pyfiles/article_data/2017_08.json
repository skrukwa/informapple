        "title": "Google is paying Apple billions per year to remain the default search engine on the iPhone",
        "body": "Google is paying Apple billions of dollars to remain the default search engine on iPhones and iPads, Bernstein said in a note to investors on Monday.\nThe firm believes that Google will pay Apple about $3 billion this year, up from $1 billion just three years ago, and that Google's licensing fees make up a large bulk of Apple's services business.\nApple has been touting its services business as a quickly growing segment of the company, noting that it expects that branch alone will soon be as large as a Fortune 500 company.\n\"Court documents indicate that Google paid Apple $1B in 2014, and we estimate that total Google payments to Apple in FY 17 may approach $3B,\" Bernstein analyst A.M. Sacconaghi Jr. said. \"Given that Google payments are nearly all profit for Apple, Google alone may account for 5% of Apple's total operating profits this year, and may account for 25% of total company OP growth over the last two years.\"\nBernstein sees pros and cons in the payments.\nSacconaghi said that Google might decide to back away from paying Apple any licensing fees if it feels confident enough that its search engine is so popular Apple won't include any other option by default.\nOn the other hand, Sacconaghi said that Apple's iOS devices contribute about 50 percent to Google's mobile search revenue, which means Google might be too afraid to walk away from its licensing deal with Apple. In this case, it's a win-win for Apple and Google.\nBernstein has an outperform rating on Apple with a price target of $175.",

        "body": "Contactless payment methods like Apple Pay will rise sharply in the United States, from less than 2 percent of transactions this year to 34 percent by 2022, according to a new report shared by research firm Juniper Research.\nPayment terminal with chip-and-PIN card support via Worldpay\nJuniper Research argued that customer dissatisfaction at the slower speeds of chip card transactions, like chip-and-signature or chip-and-PIN, will further increase the adoption of smartphone-based payments, an area currently dominated by Apple Pay.\nThe transition towards contactless payments, and even the EMV standard that chip-and-PIN cards are based on, has been much slower in the United States compared to many other countries around the world.\nIn Canada, for example, chip-and-PIN cards have been common for over five years, while at least 80 percent of Canadian retailers are now accepting contactless payments, according to payment processor MONEXgroup.\nJuniper Research expects the United States to follow a similar growth curve as Europe, where EMV and contactless payments are also widespread.\nApple CEO Tim Cook recently confirmed Apple Pay momentum is \"strongest in international markets,\" where he said the infrastructure for mobile payments has developed faster than in the United States.\nCook added that three out of four Apple Pay transactions happen outside of the U.S., where the service first launched in October 2014.\nApple Pay will support Venmo-like peer-to-peer payments in the Messages app on iOS 11, starting in the United States. Apple Pay is also expanding to Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates later this year.",

        "body": "Apple's upcoming \"iPhone 8\" will be available to order in three storage capacities and with the same amount of working memory as the current iPhone 7 Plus, according to a new post on Chinese microblogging site Weibo (via Techtastic.nl).\nThe minimum storage capacity for Apple's OLED iPhone is said to be 64GB, with a 256GB option offered as the mid-tier capacity and a 512GB option at the highest tier, while 3GB of RAM is claimed to be included across the board.\nWeibo poster GeekBar included the above image of an alleged iPhone 8 NAND flash 64GB memory module manufactured by SanDisk, which will also supply some 256GB modules, according to the source. Toshiba is also referenced as a supplier of both capacities, while Samsung and SK Hynix are said to be making the 512GB modules.\nThis is the first time SanDisk has been referenced as a NAND supplier for Apple's OLED iPhone, while Toshiba, Samsung, and SK Hynix have all been cited previously as suppliers of NAND flash chips. Earlier rumors have suggested the iPhone 8 will include increased storage space, making the device more expensive than previous-generation models, although previous additional reports claimed only that the phone would be available in 64 and 256GB capacities.\nReliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also put the iPhone 8's memory at 3GB of RAM, while the larger iPhone 7s Plus is expected to remain at 3GB RAM and the smaller iPhone 7s will continue to offer 2GB RAM. Kuo claimed the DRAM transfer speed of the three new models will be faster than the iPhone 7 by 10 to 15 percent for better augmented reality performance.\nToday's alleged photo leak follows several others in the last couple of weeks. They have included a 3D sensing camera module, an A11 processor, wireless charging pad components, and an OLED display assembly and flex power cables. Apple is expected to debut its \"premium\" redesigned 5.8-inch iPhone in the first half of September alongside upgraded (but standard) 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhones.",

        "title": "The Verge chooses not a Mac for best laptop you can buy for first time ever",
        "body": "We test a wide variety of laptops each year here at The Verge, and many of them are very good. But you can\u2019t buy them all. So to help with your purchasing decisions I\u2019ve done the very difficult (very difficult, trust me) task here of selecting 15 of the most exceptional devices out there for this Best Laptop of 2023 page. Whether you\u2019re looking for a Chromebook, a gaming laptop, a 2-in-1 convertible, an ultralight notebook, or something that\u2019s a little bit of each, I\u2019ve got multiple options for you here. These aren\u2019t necessarily the best laptops of all time, but they are, in my opinion, the best laptops you can buy right now.\nMy current pick for the best laptop of 2023 is the MacBook Air. It\u2019s a device that does just about everything right. While it\u2019s certainly not perfect, there are no major flaws. It\u2019s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming.\nIt's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptops from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad \u2014 after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.\nOur other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s include the the MacBook Pro 16 and the HP Spectre x360 14. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below or our roundup of the best gaming laptops, if you\u2019re looking for a powerful machine that doesn\u2019t sacrifice portability.\nWhat we\u2019re looking for Value: Price is a very important factor in evaluating devices for this page. We\u2019re seeking laptops that offer great value for their asking price, and that are the best of the best compared to other laptops in their price category. The more expensive a device, the more exceptional it has to be to make it on here. Performance: We want laptops with enough power to accommodate their target audience. An ultraportable laptop should be able to handle a standard office workload without excessive heat or fan noise. A gaming laptop should run today\u2019s popular games. Screen: We like displays that are color-accurate and bright. Design: We\u2019re looking for laptops with a solid, durable build that can handle a standard amount of briefcase wear-and-tear. Battery life: Battery life is much more important in some categories than it is in others. That said, in general, we assume that most shoppers are choosing a laptop over a desktop because they value some ability to work away from a plug. Battery life gives a user more freedom and makes a device more reliable for travel, so we consider it here. Port selection: The more ports, the better. We try to keep our picks as current as possible, but we may include an older device over its newer generation if we feel that the newer generation is a significant downgrade. We rarely recommend devices that are more than two years old.\n1. Apple MacBook Air (M2)\nThe best laptop of 2023\nCPU: M2 / GPU: M2/ RAM: 8GB, 16GB, 24GB / Storage: 512GB, 1TB, 2TB / Display: 13.6-inch IPS display, 2560 x 1664, 60Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches / Weight: 2.7 pounds\nThe latest MacBook Air, powered by Apple\u2019s M2 processor, is the best laptop for most people.\nThe base model, which includes 8GB of memory, 256GB of storage, an 8-core CPU, and an 8-core GPU, starts at $1,199. A model with 512GB of storage, which is what we recommend for most people and will let you keep using the laptop for longer, costs $1,399.\nThe Air has lost the wedge-shape design that was its calling card for years but retains many of the other excellent features of years past, including MagSafe charging, Touch ID, and the scissor-switch keyboard, and adds a new 1080p webcam and two new color options.\nThe Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2023. Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge\nThe M2 processor inside isn\u2019t as fast or powerful as the M1 Pro or M1 Max you get in the larger (and more expensive) MacBook Pro models, but it\u2019s still mighty fast. In our testing, it was able to handle intense office workloads with little to no heat or slowdown. Given how thin and light this device is, it delivers a combination of power and portability that you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find in many other machines out there.\nThe M2 Air didn\u2019t give us quite as much battery life as the 16-inch M1 Pro MacBook did in our rundown testing, but we would still expect it to last most people a full day of continuous use.\nApple is continuing to sell the M1 MacBook Air, which was released in 2020. If the M2 MacBook Air is out of your price range, we recommend that you consider the M1 model.\nRead our MacBook Air review.\n2. MacBook Pro (14-inch and 16-inch)\nThe best Macbook for creators\nCPU: M1 Pro, M1 Max / GPU: M1 Pro, M1 Max / RAM: 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, 96GB/ Storage: 512GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB / Display: 14.2/16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR, 3024 x 1964/3456 x 2234, adaptive refresh up to 120Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61/14.01 x 9.77 x 0.66 inches / Weight: 3.5/4.7 pounds (M2 Pro), 3.6/4.8 pounds (M2 Max)\nIt may be confusing to see both the 2021 MacBook Pro models (with the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips) and the 2023 MacBook Pro models (with the M2 Pro and M2 Max chips) on this list. The 2023 models are more powerful devices \u2014 but because of their high price, they\u2019re also more niche devices, and we recommend them mostly to professionals who need every ounce of power. We see the 2021 models, which can now be found at much lower prices, as better purchases for a more mainstream audience. That\u2019s why they\u2019re higher on this list.\nIn our benchmarks, which test a variety of creative tasks including encoding, playback, and export time, the MacBook Pro 16 did better than any laptop we\u2019ve ever used \u2014 the only other machines that have come close to matching this thing in some of our benchmarks are high-end desktop PCs. The battery life is also record-shattering. The 16-inch configuration with the M1 Pro processor lasted 16 hours in my testing \u2014 making it the longest-lasting laptop we\u2019ve ever reviewed. (The M1 Max configuration doesn\u2019t last quite as long, but still got us through a work day.)\nElsewhere, we have basically no complaints about the 2021 MacBook Pro. It has a gorgeous display that can reach 1,000 nits when playing HDR content. It pairs that with the best set of speakers we\u2019ve ever heard from a laptop. And these Pro models can output to multiple external displays, while the Air is limited to one.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a machine that can accommodate a demanding workload while also serving as an excellent multimedia device when you\u2019re off the clock, you\u2019ll likely be satisfied with what the M1 Pro and M1 Max can do.\nIf you\u2019re a creative professional who doesn\u2019t quite want to pay the price of the MacBook Pro 16, or you\u2019re looking for something more compact, you\u2019re probably better suited to the 14-inch MacBook Pro. This device is smaller, lighter, and less expensive than its 16-inch counterpart, but it comes with the same monstrous processor options and the same stellar screen.\nWe didn\u2019t see much of a difference in benchmark scores between the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBooks with the same processors \u2014 the 14-incher actually outperformed the 16-inchers in some of our tests. The primary difference to consider, apart from the sizes of these devices, is battery life. The 16-inch chassis allows for a significantly bigger battery, and the 16-inch M1 Pro model lasted several hours longer than the 14-inch M1 Pro model did in our testing.\nRead our MacBook Pro 14 and 16 review.\n3. HP Spectre x360 14\nThe best Windows laptop\nCPU: Intel Core i5 1235U, Core i7 1255U, Core i7-1355U / GPU: Intel UHD, Iris Xe / RAM: 8GB, 16GB / Storage: 512GB, 1TB / Display: 13.5-inch IPS, 60Hz, 1920 x 1280/OLED, 3000 x 2000, touch option / Dimensions: 11.75 x 8.67 x 0.67 inches / Weight: 3.01 pounds\nIt\u2019s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It\u2019s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel.\nBut the Spectre x360 14 isn\u2019t just pretty to look at: it\u2019s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel\u2019s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device \u2014 one of the best results we\u2019ve ever seen.\nThe HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy. Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge\nOn the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn\u2019t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There\u2019s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre \u2014 handy if you\u2019re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market.\nSuch an exceptional package of features doesn\u2019t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it\u2019s the best Windows laptop you can buy.\nRead our HP Spectre x360 14 review.\n4. Asus Zenbook Pro Duo 14\nThe best dual-screen laptop\nCPU: Intel Core i9-13900H / GPU: Nvidia Geforce RTX 4050, RTX 4060 / RAM: 32GB / Storage: 512GB, 1TB, 2TB / Display: 14.5-inch OLED, 2880 x 1800, 120Hz + 12.7-inch IPS, 2880 x 864, 60Hz, touch option / Dimensions: 12.74 x 8.85 x 0.7 inches/ Weight: 3.86 pounds\nFinally, there is a dual-screen laptop we can actually recommend buying. In the past, the dual-screen form factor has felt gimmicky, difficult to see, and difficult to use. But in the Zenbook Duo 14, Asus has angled the screen significantly higher than before, made it higher resolution, and given it an anti-glare etching that\u2019s made it actually useful.\nThe Asus Zenbook Pro Duo 14 OLED has not one, but two high-resolution screens. Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge\nUsing Asus\u2019s ScreenXpert software, Zenbook Pro Duo users essentially have a small, crisp secondary OLED monitor on their keyboard deck. This second screen can also be turned into a giant touchpad (which is helpful since the actual touchpad the device comes with is pretty tiny. The device also comes with high-performance chips from Intel and Nvidia, and a roomy 16:10 primary screen. While the keyboard-in-the-front layout won\u2019t be for everyone, this innovative device is the best choice for shoppers who want multiple screens in one.\nRead our Asus Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED review.\n5. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThe best gaming laptop\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 $ 1155 $ 1650 30 % off $ 1155 $ 1155 $ 1650 30 % off The ROG Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop. Its AMD Ryzen 9 processor and GeForce RTX 3060 can push powerful, smooth graphics performance in games with its QHD display while also being surprisingly efficient for other tasks. $1155 at Best Buy\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS / GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6700S / RAM: 8GB / Storage: 1TB / Display: 14-inch IPS, 2560 x 1600, 120Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 12.28 x 8.94 x 0.73/ Weight: 3.64 pounds\nYou want to be careful with this one, because some of the models are too expensive for what they offer. Make sure that you\u2019re buying the $1,649.99 SKU with the 6700S GPU. We feel that this model, specifically, is the best 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy. It\u2019s a perfectly portable device at just 3.79 pounds and 0.77 inches thick, and it comes with a great keyboard, touchpad, port selection, and screen. The frame rates it produced in our testing were solid, and we didn\u2019t see a huge difference in performance between the 6700S and 6800S models. And we got all-day battery life, which you don\u2019t see in gaming laptops every day.\nThe Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is the lightweight gaming laptop to buy. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nIf you are interested in having an animated grid of colored lights on your computer, you can also pay more for a model that has Asus\u2019s AniMe Matrix. We don\u2019t think these models offer particularly good value for their price, but they do have some cute benefits \u2013 you can customize them to display words or images of your choice, and there\u2019s a virtual pet on it that you can play with.\nRead our Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 review.\n6. Asus Chromebook Flip CX5\nThe best 15-inch Chromebook\nCPU: Intel Core i5-1135G7 / GPU: Intel Iris Xe / RAM: 16GB / Storage: 128GB / Display: 15.6-inch IPS, 1920 x 1080, 60Hz / Dimensions: 14.08 x 9.48 x 0.73/ Weight: 4.3 pounds\nAsus surprised us with its Chromebook Flip CX5, a gorgeous $800 laptop that happens to run Chrome OS. It\u2019s as sturdy and well-built as all kinds of Windows laptops at higher price points, and sports a unique smooth texture. It includes fully-fledged laptop specs, including a 57Wh battery, which provide speedy performance, long battery life, and quick charging.\nThe Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 is a massive, powerful Chromebook. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales\nYou get all kinds of ports, including an HDMI and a microSD slot. The speakers sound great, and the keyboard is comfortable. Asus hasn\u2019t skimped on CX5\u2019s chassis or its performance \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely the product to buy if you\u2019re looking for a Chromebook with a big screen.\nRead our Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 review.\n7. MacBook Pro 16 (M2 Pro and M2 Max)\nBest video editing laptop\nCPU: M2 Pro, M2 Max / GPU: M2 Pro, M2 Max / RAM: 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, 96GB / Storage: 512GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB / Display: 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR, 3456 x 2234, adaptive refresh up to 120Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 14.01 x 9.77 x 0.66 inches / Weight: 4.7 pounds (M2 Pro), 4.8 pounds (M2 Max)\nIf you\u2019re a professional with a heavy workload looking for the best in power, graphics, and battery life that Apple has to offer, you want the 16-inch MacBook Pro with Apple\u2019s brand-new M2 Pro or M2 Max. It won\u2019t come cheap \u2013 models start at $2,499 \u2013 but it is one of the most powerful and longest-lasting laptops you can buy. To reiterate, we believe that most creators should go for a discounted M1 Pro or M1 Max laptop over this one \u2014 the newest M2 Pro and M2 Max are best for the most deep-pocketed of power users.\nThe 2023 MacBook Pro looks very similar to the 2021 MacBook Pro, with the same camera notch, the same port selection (including MagSafe charging), and the same exceptional speaker system.\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro is a good option for power users. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nIn testing, we\u2019ve found that the M2 Max provides several additional hours of battery life over the M1 Max that powered the 2021 MacBook Pro 16. The M2 Max also has more multicore and single-core CPU power, and a lot more graphic power, than the M1 Max did. That won\u2019t make a difference for standard home and office tasks, but can save you some time if your occupation requires a really powerful PC.\nFor more guidance on which M2 MacBook to buy, we\u2019ve got a video breaking down the M2 lineup.\nRead our MacBook Pro 16 review.\n8. MacBook Air 15\nThe best 15-inch laptop\nCPU: M2 / GPU: M2 / RAM: 16GB, 16GB, 24GB / Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB / Display: 15.3-inch IPS display, 2880 x 1864, 60Hz no touch option / Dimensions: 13.4 x 9.35 x 0.45 inches / Weight: 3.3 pounds\nThe MacBook Pro 15 is the 15-inch laptop that a lot of people have been waiting for. It\u2019s got a large, gorgeous screen, but it\u2019s much lighter and less expensive than the 16-inch MacBook Pro models that are currently available. It has the same M2 chip that powers the 13-inch MacBook Air further up this list, but its larger chassis allows for a bit of extra cooling (and therefore, slightly more performance). For those who like the portability of the 13-inch MacBook Air but want more screen space to work with, the Air 15 is the option.\nThe MacBook Air 16 is a lightweight, big-screen laptop. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nThe 15-inch Air does have a few compromises that the 14-inch and 16-inch Pro don\u2019t. Most importantly, its port selection is limited to two USB-C Thunderbolt, one MagSafe, and one headphone jack, and all but the headphone jack are crammed onto the left side. It also only supports one external display, which is a frustrating limitation for some. Nevertheless, as a more affordable and portable option than Apple\u2019s other big-screen offerings, the Air will still be the best choice for a lot of people.\nRead our MacBook Air 15 review.\n9. Framework Laptop\nA repairable laptop for DIYers\nFramework Laptop 13 $ 849 The Framework Laptop 13 is the best laptop for those who want full control of their experience. Everything from the processor and RAM to the keyboard and bezels is user-upgradeable. $849 at Framework\nCPU: Intel Core i5-1340P/i7-1360P/17-1370P, AMD Ryzen 7 7840U / GPU: Intel UHD/Iris Xe, Radeon 700M / RAM: 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB / Storage: 250GB, 500GB, 1TB, 2TB / Display: 13.5 inch IPS, 2256 x 1540, 60Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 11.68 x 9.01 x 0.62 inches / Weight: 2.87 pounds\nIf you want a 13-inch laptop that you can configure and assemble yourself, from the ground up, the Framework Laptop 13 is pretty much your only option. The Framework is a modular laptop that users can repair and upgrade over the length of their ownership. Everything from the RAM, to the storage, to even the processor can be upgraded down the line. The company has even come out with upgrades for parts like speakers and hinges that you can install yourself. Not only can you buy it as a prebuilt system, but you can also order it as a DIY kit, allowing you to assemble the entire thing yourself and swap out parts as you please.\nRepairability aside, the Framework has a number of laudable features as a laptop itself. The display is bright and high-resolution, the speakers are great, and the chassis is quite portable, coming in at under three pounds. The 3:2 aspect ratio provides a lot of room to work, and still a somewhat rare find on today\u2019s market.\nThe Framework Laptop 13 is one of very few 13-inch laptops with this degree of repairability. Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge\nThat said, I won\u2019t pretend that this is the best 13-inch laptop you can buy; on its own merits, it is an unremarkable system with a somewhat generic look and plasticky build, particularly compared to others in its price category. Nevertheless, the Framework\u2019s standout feature is the unprecedented access it allows its users to replace and repair its parts. We\u2019d love to see more companies make that kind of commitment to sustainable design.\nRead our Framework Laptop 13 review.\n10.

Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. At well under three pounds and just over half an inch thick, it\u2019s a dream for travel and on-the-go work.\nThe specs of our test unit (a Core i5 configuration) were just fine for the work tasks I needed to do. I do recommend using the Silent cooling profile if you don\u2019t need heavyweight performance, as the fans get going very easily on this model.\nThe Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops of 2023. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nThere is also a fancier Dell XPS 13 Plus available for purchase, which includes all kinds of new features the XPS 13 doesn\u2019t have including an OLED display option, borderless haptic touchpad, and LED touch function keys, as well as a more powerful P-series processor. I don\u2019t recommend that model over this one for most people, but it\u2019s worth looking into if you want something a bit funkier with a higher-resolution screen.\nRead our Dell XPS 13 review.\n11. Asus Zenbook S 13 OLED\nThe best OLED laptop\nCPU: Intel Core i7-1355U / GPU: Intel Iris Xe / RAM: 32GB / Storage: 1TB / Display: 13.3-inch OLED, 2880 x 1800, 60Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 11.66 x 8.52 x 0.43 inches / Weight: 2.2 pounds\nIf your top priority is a lightweight laptop with an excellent screen, look no further than the Asus Zenbook S 13 OLED. Powered by Intel\u2019s new 13th-Gen processors, it\u2019s an astonishingly lightweight device with a neat, unique design. The lid doesn\u2019t pick up fingerprints, which is a very rare thing to be able to say about dark laptops.\nIn addition to its compact build, the Zenbook S 13 has a solid port selection including HDMI 2.1, USB-A, and multiple Thunderbolt ports. The OLED display is sharp and roomy, and looks quite nice.\nThe Asus Zenbook S 13 OLED is the best laptop you can buy with a 13-inch OLED screen. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nThe Intel processor in my test model did an excellent job with my multitasking workload. It can get loud while completing heavier tasks like gaming, but a built-in Whisper Mode will keep it quiet during everyday productivity work (which is the sort of workload this device is best suited for).\nRead our Asus Zenbook S 13 OLED review.\n12.

It comes with a magnetic detachable keyboard that\u2019s a breeze to pop on and off. The screen also supports USI styluses, though a stylus is not included in the price. The keyboard is included in the price, however, as is the magnetic back cover and kickstand.\nThe Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 is a great option for anyone shopping on a tight budget. Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge\nDay-to-day, this laptop is quite usable for light work and leisure. It has a sharp, bright 11-inch screen and a surprisingly comfortable keyboard and touchpad. The battery life is close to all-day. But the real draw of this device is its portability \u2014 it\u2019s just 2.09 pounds with the keyboard attached, making it quite convenient to carry around and whip out to use on the go.\nRead our Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 review.\n13. Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 (13.5-inch)\nA lower-cost thin and light option\nCPU: Intel Core i5 1235U, Core i7-1255U / GPU: Intel Iris Xe / RAM: 8GB, 16GB / Storage: 256GB, 512GB / Display: 13.5-inch IPS, 2256 x 1504, 60Hz, touch option / Dimensions: 12.1 x 8.8 x .57 inches / Weight: 2.8 pounds\nThe Surface Laptop 5 looks and feels quite similar to last year\u2019s Surface Laptop 4. Like its predecessor, the Laptop 5 is thin, light, and well built, with Microsoft\u2019s signature elegant style. Newly this year, the Laptop 5 supports Thunderbolt 4 \u2014 but unlike last year, there are only Intel models, with no AMD ones available.\nThe Surface Laptop 5 is a thin and light work machine. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nInside, the 12th-Gen processors delivery satisfactory performance, particularly single-core tasks. We felt no heat or fan noise during our testing, which was remarkable considering the device\u2019s thin profile. Our tasks looked quite sharp on the 3:2, 13-inch display as well. Our primary complaint was the battery life, which is okay, but not amazing, and a decrease from last year\u2019s results.\nRead our Surface Laptop 5 review.\n14.

Equipped with top-end chips from Nvidia and Intel, it can run most of today\u2019s\u2019 most demanding games at their highest settings with all the effects you want. Add Razer\u2019s signature suave chassis and fun (but unobtrusive) RGB keyboard, and there\u2019s little to complain about.\nBut it\u2019s not just the performance that stands out \u2014 games also look great. The Blade comes with an optional Mini LED screen.

HP Dragonfly Pro\nThe best business laptop\nHP Elite Dragonfly Pro $ 1550 The HP Elite Dragonfly Pro is one of the best business laptops for freelancers and self-employed customers.

It\u2019s powered by AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7000 series, and its performance rivaled that of the M2 MacBook Pro in our testing. Battery life, while not quite M2-level, was enough to power through a full day unplugged. There\u2019s little to object to among the other features as well. The speakers sound good, the webcam delivers a detailed picture, the keyboard is comfortable, and the screen is quite bright. In typical HP fashion, the chassis is quite well built with a sleek and professional look.\nThe HP Dragonfly Pro is the best business laptop you can buy. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nThe Dragonfly Pro comes with an optional 24/7 live support service, which you can access via a hotkey on the right side of the keyboard. It\u2019s included with the first year, and then it\u2019s $10.99 per month. This isn\u2019t something we think most people will need, but if you\u2019re interested in having access to that sort of program, this is the laptop for you.\nVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

        "body": "Apple is said to be \"scrambling\" to strike deals with movie studios in Hollywood regarding the exact prices of 4K movies in the iTunes Store, taking places just weeks ahead of the rumored debut of the new 4K Apple TV in mid-September.\nWhile the talks have been ongoing for some time, discussions have been recently hampered by disagreements over the pricing of 4K movie purchases, according to sources close to the talks (via The Wall Street Journal). Apple wants to charge $19.99 for 4K movie purchases in its digital iTunes Store, the same price it currently charges for newly-released HD films.\nHowever, many Hollywood studios it has talked with are pushing back on that price point and are looking to charge customers a premium for the new 4K content: $25 to $30 for a 4K movie in iTunes.\nApple wants to have major Hollywood films available in ultra-high definition on the new device, expected to go on sale later this year. However, it wants to charge $19.99 for those movies\u2014on par with what it sometimes charges for new HD movies, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. Several Hollywood studios want to charge $5 to $10 more for 4K movies, the people said.\nApple is said to be trying to finish these discussions well before September 12, the currently rumored date that will see the unveiling of the new 4K Apple TV, iPhone 8, iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, Apple Watch Series 3, and more software-related announcements. As iTunes loses market share to companies like Amazon and Comcast, Apple is hoping that a revitalized Apple TV streaming box with 4K content -- which many rival devices have already supported -- will help boost iTunes sales into the last half of 2017 and the new year.\nIn other Hollywood-related talks, earlier this month it was reported that multiple studios were pushing forward with a plan to offer digital movie rentals mere weeks after they appear in theaters. Studios like Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. were said to be in talks with partners, including Apple, to offer movies in iTunes as early as 17 days after their theatrical debut for about $50, or four to six weeks from release for $30.",

Apple\u2019s new method is a far more discreet way of locking out a phone, especially if you\u2019re in a situation where you\u2019re worried someone might force you to unlock your phone.\nQuickly disabling Touch ID will be useful in certain situations\nUnlocking phones with a fingerprint sensor is a hot topic for law enforcement requests, and police in Michigan even 3D-printed a murder victim\u2019s fingerprint to gain access to a device. With fears over access to devices at border control points around the world, this quick trick will at least prevent Touch ID from being used until a passcode is entered.",

        "body": "Anyone haunted by annoying link cruft will be relieved to hear that iOS 11 will transform Google AMP links back into their original forms when sharing a story from Safari. MacStories editor Federico Viticci first spotted the change, which appears to be live in the new iOS 11 beta 7.\nVery nice: when sharing AMP pages to iMessage or Reading List, iOS 11 Safari automatically removes AMP\u2019s crap from the URL. Go Apple \ud83d\udc4d pic.twitter.com/aHgSMcofUv \u2014 Federico Viticci (@viticci) August 23, 2017\nGoogle\u2019s fast-loading AMP pages are ideal for platform-agnostic consumers looking for a quick read, but publishers tend to loathe them (with good reason). Pointing users toward Google domains instead of canonical links limits a publisher\u2019s opportunities to drive further engagement by keeping a user on-site, hindering things like newsletter signups and subscription services that can be powerful monetization options for publishers.\nEarlier this year, Google announced that AMP links now load twice as fast thanks to image compression improvements and other under the hood tweaks. For the rest of us who favor purity over unbridled speed, this little iOS 11 change is just one more reason to look forward to September.",

        "body": "The U.K. home secretary Amber Rudd has argued that \"real people\" do not want secure end-to-end encryption on messaging platforms and are more concerned with usability and features than unbreakable security (via Yahoo News).\nRudd made her case in a newspaper article, published ahead of a meeting today with technology companies in San Francisco, where she will warn tech giants that their services are being misused by terrorists. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Rudd said:\n\"Who uses WhatsApp because it is end-to-end encrypted, rather than because it is an incredibly user-friendly and cheap way of staying in touch with friends and family? \"So this is not about asking the companies to break encryption or create so-called 'back doors'. \"Companies are constantly making trade-offs between security and 'usability', and it is here where our experts believe opportunities may lie. \"Real people often prefer ease of use and a multitude of features to perfect, unbreakable security.\"\nRudd's comments were immediately criticized by privacy campaigners, with civil liberties organization Big Brother Watch calling her viewpoint \"at best na\u00efve, at worst dangerous\".\n\"Suggesting that people don't really want security from their online services is frankly insulting,\" said Renate Samson, chief executive of BBW. \"What of those in society who are in dangerous or vulnerable situations, let alone those of us who simply want to protect our communications from breach, hack or cybercrime.\"\n\"Once again the government are attempting to undermine the security of all in response to the actions of a few. We are all digital citizens, we all deserve security in the digital space.\"\nRudd is due to give her speech to tech companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Microsoft, in which she will urge them to do more to remove extremist content online or face new laws forcing them to do so.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Rudd said she wanted to work more closely with companies on encryption so that \"where there is a particular need, where there is a targeted need\" the government should be given access to metadata and encrypted content.\nBut Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, pushed back against that argument, and warned about pushing criminals into even harder to reach parts of the internet.\n\"If people move off those encrypted services to go to encrypted services in countries that won't share the metadata, the government actually has less information, not more,\" she said.\nTuesday's summit is the first gathering of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, an organization set up by the major tech companies following recent terror attacks. Organization members are likely to resist any action that would result in compromised encryption, however.\nIn a joint statement, the companies taking part said they were co-operating to \"substantially disrupt terrorists' ability to use the internet in furthering their causes, while also respecting human rights\".",

        "body": "Popular and well-known iOS weather app AccuWeather has been caught collecting and sharing user location data even when location sharing permissions are turned off, according to a blog post recently shared by security researcher Will Strafach.\nAccording to Strafach, AccuWeather was partnering with data monetization firm Reveal Mobile to collect GPS coordinates, including speed and altitude, the name and BSSID of a user's Wi-Fi router, and whether a device has Bluetooth on and off, all of which was available to Reveal Mobile when location services were enabled.\nWith location services disabled, AccuWeather was still sending the Wi-Fi router name and BSSID, which still offered Reveal Mobile location data.\nDuring a testing period of 36 hours, specifically while the AccuWeather application was not in the foreground, my test iPhone (located on a desk in an office building) sent the above information to RevealMobile a total of 16 times, occuring roughly once every few hours.\nReval Mobile is a firm that uses location data to gather information on a user's home, work, and frequently visited locations, pairing that data with demographic targeting criteria to allow retailers to deliver targeted ads. From the company's website:\nBy expanding the use case of location data to pre- and post-shopping experiences, entirely new possibilities open up for online and offline retailers. The value lies in understanding the path of a consumer and where they go throughout the day. Traveling from home to work to retail to soccer practice to dinner is vital to knowing the customer, and represents the new opportunity of mobile location data.\nIn response to Strafach's blog post, Reveal Mobile says the data it collects is anonymized and grouped into audience segments. \"We offer no product or service that permits anyone to see an individual device's location data,\" reads a statement on the Reveal Mobile website. The company also says it does not reverse engineer a device's location when location sharing is turned off.\nWe do not attempt to reverse engineer a device's location based upon other data signals like Bluetooth when location services are disabled. In looking at our current SDK's behavior, we see how that can be misconstrued. In response to that, we're releasing a new version of our SDK which will no longer send any data points which could be used to infer location when someone opts out of location sharing. We do collect IP address, but do not use this data to determine location, as covered in our privacy policy.\nAccuWeather vice president of emerging platforms David Mitchell told ZDNet that AccuWeather will use data through Reveal Mobile for \"audience segmentation and analysis, to build a greater audience understanding and create more contextually relevant and helpful experiences for users and for advertiser.\"\nFollowing Strafach's discovery, many people have been uninstalling the AccuWeather app, and given the wealth of weather apps available in the App Store, this is not surprising. AccuWeather does not apparently have plans to end its relationship with Reveal Mobile, so users may want to find another weather app.\nUpdate: AccuWeather and Reveal Mobile have provided a joint statement on the issue:\nDespite stories to the contrary from sources not connected to the actual information, if a user opts out of location tracking on AccuWeather, no GPS coordinates are collected or passed without further opt-in permission from the user. Other data, such as Wi-Fi network information that is not user information, was for a short period available on the Reveal SDK, but was unused by AccuWeather. In fact, AccuWeather was unaware the data was available to it. Accordingly, at no point was the data used by AccuWeather for any purpose. AccuWeather and Reveal Mobile are committed to following the standards and best practices of the industry. We also recognize this is a quickly evolving field and what is best practice one day may change the next. Accordingly, we work to update our practices regularly. To avoid any further misinterpretation, Reveal is updating its SDK and pushing out new versions of the SDK in the next 24 hours, with the iOS update going live tonight. The end result should be that zero data is transmitted back to Reveal Mobile when someone opts out of location sharing. In the meanwhile, AccuWeather had already disabled the SDK, pending that update. Reveal has stated that the SDK could be misconstrued, and they assure that no reverse engineering of locations was ever conducted by any information they gathered, nor was that the intent. AccuWeather will work with Reveal to restore the SDK when it has been amended and will continue to update its ULAs to be transparent and current with evolving standards. AccuWeather and Reveal continue to enhance methods for handling data and strive to provide superior, seamless, and secure user experiences. We are grateful to have a supportive community that highlights areas where we can optimize and be more transparent.\nUpdate 2: AccuWeather has updated its app to remove the Reveal Mobile SDK.",

The latest from Rambo is that the iPhone 8 could leverage the widely rumored front-facing 3D sensor on the device to allow for the phone to detect whether or not a user is actively using the phone, and to silence notifications if you are ( via 9to5Mac ).\nAs to whether or not Rambo\u2019s conclusions of the feature are correct, it\u2019s certainly an interesting and useful sounding addition.

        "title": "Apple Watch sales up over 50% since last year",
        "body": "Apple Watch sales are up more than 50 percent since last year, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. He mentioned this when discussing Apple\u2019s strong third-quarter results on the investor call Tuesday.\nOverall, Apple beat analyst expectations with $1.67 per share, versus the anticipated $1.57 per share. Revenue was $45.4 billion, when Wall Street forecast $44.89 billion.\nShares were quickly up 5 percent in initial after-hours trading on the good news, but one often overlooked category is \u201cother products,\u201d where they group in the performance of things like Apple Watches, Apple TVs, Beats electronics, iPods and Apple-branded accessories.\nThis category brought in $2.74 billion in revenue and is up 23 percent since the same period last year. One product that is contributing to the annual revenue growth is AirPods, the wireless earbuds that Apple released in December of last year. (I personally think they look a tad dorky, but everyone I know who has them loves the sound quality.)\nSince all AirPod revenue is new and the Apple Watch is up more than 50 percent since last year, that means most of the other products in the category likely saw much slower growth or even some declines since the weighted average is lower, at a positive 23 percent. But without knowing approximately what revenue percentage Apple Watch accounts for, we don\u2019t know for sure.\nOne analyst, Ben Bajarin from Creative Strategies, estimates that Apple Watch sold two to three million devices.\nSeems both 1Q and 2Q 2017 Apple Watch sales up 50% YoY meaning between 2-3 million units. Nice start for Watch in 2017. \u2014 Ben Bajarin (@BenBajarin) August 1, 2017\nIt\u2019s not clear why sales are up so significantly. Some people have suggested that compatibility with AirPods have helped sales. It also probably helps that fitness trackers like Fitbit are struggling and Jawbone is going out of business. Also, since the release dates were staggered, a September 2016 watch is more current than an April 2015 watch was in the same period last year.\n\u201cOther products\u201d is down 5 percent since quarter two of this year, but there tends to be a seasonality to retail products. Also it\u2019s been a while since the September 2016 release of the Apple Watch second generation product and Apple TV hasn\u2019t had a new product since October 2015, so a quarterly decline is not surprising.\nThen there\u2019s Beats Electronics, which the company spent $3 billion to buy in 2014. The Dr. Dre-branded headphones have a cult following, but there\u2019s also a lot of competition.\nAs for iPods, most Apple fans own an iPhone by now, so it\u2019s hard to see why people would buy a separate product with overlapping capabilities.\nLet\u2019s hope Apple gives us a more detailed breakdown of all the \u201cother products.\u201d",

Yesterday, a true internet hero named Samir Mezrahi released a song on iTunes that's just 10 minutes of silence -- and he named it \"A a a a a Very Good Song.\" Since the iPhone starts playing music alphabetically when you plug it in to many car stereos, that usually means there's one song that you hear whether you want to or not. Many songs starting with the letter A have probably been ruined thanks to this quirk -- but if you download Mezrahi's creation, you'll instead have plenty of time to queue up the songs you want to hear.\nhey I released a blank song that will play 1st so that *one* song won't play every time u plug ur phone into ur car https://t.co/FL83YUOOcz \u2014 #1 samir (@samir) August 9, 2017\nIn less than a day, it's become clear that Merahi's trick is resonating with a lot of people -- his tweet announcing the track has over 12,000 likes.

Right now it sits at #67, ahead of tunes by artists like Kendrick Lamar, Kesha, Selena Gomez, The Chainsmokers and a number of other popular, well-established acts. (It's worth noting that Rezhami's silent song is hardly the first to gain notoriety, though I don't think that John Cage's composition ever made a run up the iTunes charts.)\nNOT ALL HEROES WEAR CAPES https://t.co/93s4TDXG4c \u2014 ellie\u2728 (@j_elliebean) August 9, 2017\nThe question now is whether or not Apple will remove the track from the iTunes Store. On the one hand, it's clearly a joke, but on the other Apple benefits from every sale. Of course, Mezrahi is also laughing his way to the bank, but you can't blame a man for having a good idea. Many will surely point out that this hack could be done by manually making your own blank song and adding it to your phone, but the convenience of spending 99 cents on this to make the problem go away is a tradeoff that seems worth it.\nIf you're an Apple Music user, we have even better news for you -- you can just add the song to your library there as part of your subscription. But it might be more fun to pay the buck and see if the world can get a blank track of silence to the top of the iTunes charts.\nSubscribe to the Engadget Deals Newsletter Great deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget\u2019s editorial team.

        "body": "Apple shipped an estimated 2.8 million Apple Watch units in the June quarter, an increase of 56 percent from an estimated 1.8 million shipments in the year-ago quarter, according to a new report by research firm Strategy Analytics.\nStrategy Analytics previously estimated Apple Watch shipments totaled 13.6 million in 2015, 11.6 million in 2016, and 3.5 million last quarter, suggesting Apple shipped its 30 millionth Apple Watch at some point in the past three to four months.\nSpecifically, Apple Watch shipments have now reached an estimated 31.5 million units over the product's lifetime.\nDespite the milestone, Strategy Analytics claims Apple trails Fitbit and Chinese company Xiaomi, estimated to be the world's largest wearables vendor, but both sell less expensive fitness trackers.\nXiaomi shipped an estimated 3.7 million wearables in the June quarter, according to Strategy Analytics, while Fitbit on Wednesday reported sales of 3.4 million devices in the same period, down from 5.7 million a year ago.\n\"Apple has for now lost its wearables leadership to Xiaomi, due to a lack of presence in the sizeable fitness band subcategory,\" said Cliff Raskind, Director at Strategy Analytics. \"However, the rumored upcoming Watch Series 3 launch with enhanced health tracking could prove to be a popular smartwatch model and enable Apple to reclaim the top wearables spot later this year.\"\nIt's important to acknowledge these are estimated figures, and that shipments do not necessarily reflect sales. And, as mentioned, Xiaomi doesn't participate in the high-end smartwatch market, and Apple doesn't compete in the low-end fitness tracker market. It's essentially an apples to oranges comparison.\nApple doesn't break out Apple Watch sales like it does with iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Instead, it groups the wearable under its \"Other Products\" category, alongside Apple TV, AirPods, Beats, iPods, and other accessories.\nApple reported \"Other Products\" revenue of $2.7 billion in the June quarter, up 23 percent on year.\nIn its post-earnings conference call, Apple CEO Tim Cook once again talked up how well Apple Watch is supposedly selling.\n\"Sales of Apple Watch were up over 50 percent in the June quarter,\" said Cook. \"It's the number one selling smartwatch in the world by a very wide margin.\"\n\"Apple Watch is having a positive impact on peoples' health and daily lives, and motivating them to sit less and move more,\" he added. \"With features like built-in GPS and waterproofing, Apple Watch Series 2 is the perfect companion for hiking, running, and swimming.\"\nCook has made similar statements in the past. In the March quarter, he noted that sales of Apple Watch nearly doubled year over year. In the December quarter, he announced that Apple Watch had its best quarter ever.\nStrategy Analytics doesn't disclose its exact methodology of calculating Apple Watch shipments for competitive reasons, but executive director Neil Mawston has told MacRumors the research firm uses \"a blend of channel checks, financial analysis, and other sources\" when asked in the past.\n\"It is the same methodology we have used for phones since the 1990s and for wearables since the modern market first emerged circa 2013,\" he added.\nThe focus now turns to the fall, when Apple is rumored to debut Apple Watch Series 3 models, potentially alongside its new lineup of iPhones.",

        "title": "Today in Apple history: Rainbow Apple logo gets a modern overhaul",
        "body": "August 27, 1999: Apple replaces its striped, multicolored logo used since 1977 with a new single-color version.\nThe replacement of the iconic logo shocks many longtime Apple fans. However, it is part of a sustained, company-wide overhaul by Steve Jobs. The makeover includes new products, the \u201cThink Different\u201d ad campaign and, eventually, the removal of the word \u201cComputer\u201d from the company\u2019s name.\nThe birth of the \u2018bitten apple\u2019 logo\nApple\u2019s very first corporate logo was actually not the memorable \u201cbitten apple\u201d logo at all. A riff on a Victorian woodcut, Cupertino\u2019s original logo portrayed Sir Isaac Newton sitting beneath a tree with a solitary apple dangling over his head.\nA quotation from William Wordsworth\u2019s The Prelude ran around the image\u2019s border: \u201cA mind forever wandering through strange seas of thought, alone.\u201d (Apple\u2019s third co-founder, Ron Wayne \u2014 who sold his stake in the company for just $800 \u2014 designed the original logo.)\nAfter less than a year, Apple replaced that logo with the outline we know today. Designed by 29-year-old Rob Janoff, it coincided with the debut of the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire, which marked Apple\u2019s graduation from a small startup to a serious business. Janoff was a junior art designer at Regis McKenna, a firm that handled a lot of Apple\u2019s early marketing and publicity.\nSteve Jobs and the Apple logo\nJobs gave Janoff \u2014 who does not receive any royalties for his design \u2014 two directions for the Apple logo. One, don\u2019t make it cute. And two, find some way to visually incorporate the Apple II\u2019s revolutionary 16-color display.\nJanoff added the bite in the apple to give it a sense of scale when reproduced at different sizes. (It was also a play on the word \u201cbyte.\u201d) The colorful stripes showed off the Apple II\u2019s big feature, while embracing the countercultural tenor of the times.\n\u201cI had a big hippie influence myself, having grown up in North California in the late \u201960s,\u201d Janoff told me for my book The Apple Revolution. \u201cI\u2019d dabbled in all the psychedelic stuff, as well as the music and the visuals. To me, it was more interesting to draw it like that than, say, a red apple. The idea was to make it appealing, and to differentiate it from everything else that was out there.\u201d\nFor anyone paying attention after Jobs\u2019 return to Cupertino in the late 1990s, the new Apple logo came as no surprise. The earlier iMac G3 featured a single-color logo as part of its case design, although the striped logo continued to show up in Apple\u2019s software \u2014 for example, in the \u201cApple menu.\u201d\nNew Apple logo, new direction for Apple\nOn August 27, 1999, Apple officially scrapped the rainbow logo, telling vendors not to use it anymore. Cupertino replaced it with single-color versions of the logo in different colors. Vendors could choose between black and red versions of the flat logo.\n\u201cLike our products and our customers, the Apple brand continues to evolve,\u201d Apple wrote in its marketing guidelines, which spelled out the thinking behind the logo change:\n\u201cTo reflect this, we\u2019ve made some important changes to the Apple logo and how we use it, and how we expect our channel to use it, too. Don\u2019t worry: We haven\u2019t replaced the logo, just updated it. We\u2019ll continue to reflect who we are and what we stand for as a company in the same timeless symbol: an apple with a bite taken out of it. We\u2019ve reduced some of the clutter in the original design, however, and updated the way we use color and light. In other words, we\u2019ve taken the same standards of style and innovation that make our products and our design unmistakable and applied them to the company logo. Instead of rainbow stripes, solid colors. Instead of just one solid color, a palette of logo colors to suit a variety of uses. Solid colors emphasize the timeless shape of the Apple logo.\u201d\nApple later upgraded the single-color logo. The new polished-metal look reflected materials used by Apple design chief Jony Ive.\nWhich version of the Apple logo do you prefer? Leave your comments below.",

        "body": "The official Wikipedia app for iOS [Direct Link] has been updated this week with an all-new dark mode, letting users adjust the app for better Wikipedia browsing and reading in low-light environments. Aside from expected darker colors, the new dark mode is said to include \"image dimming,\" so brighter pictures aren't as harsh when scrolling through Wikipedia entries.\nA separate option in sepia colors is available now as well, and Wikipedia said that users will also be able to adjust text size in appearance controls.\nDark mode! Read in comfort with new Appearance controls, including dark colors and image dimming. Make those late night Wikipedia sessions easier on the eyes. Choose between sepia, dark or white themes to read Wikipedia your way!\nThe version 5.6 update also introduced an iMessage sticker pack for Wikipedia users, and a few new ways for readers to explore and discover new articles. In the Explore feed, an \"on this day\" card will highlight interesting events that happened on the day in question throughout history, with a timeline that users can scrub through to see other events on the same day.\nStandalone iOS apps have been gaining support for dark mode individually over the years, although a system-wide solution introduced on Apple's part remains omitted from any version of iOS. The upcoming launch of iOS 11 will include a new \"Smart Invert\" feature in accessibility options, reversing the display's colors with an overall effect that's similar to what users want out of dark mode. But the feature doesn't extend to all UI elements in iOS 11, including exceptions related to images, media, and some apps.\nThe official Wikipedia app is available to download for free from the iOS App Store.

        "title": "Foxconn exec says \u2018estimated iPhone 8 is not cheap\u2019 as new copper gold case image surfaces",
        "body": "Over the weekend, there were a couple interesting stories about the upcoming iPhone 8 originating from Weibo. A Foxconn vice president posted to his public social feed that the iPhone 8 will not be cheap, as yields of the OLED display are low (40% failure rate) due to the \u2018special design\u2019 (the custom top notch).\nSeparately, photos of a new iPhone 8 rear case color appeared online although the validity of the image is not clear. In addition to the usual black and white, the photos depict an OLED iPhone in a copper gold color. More photos after the break \u2026\nA certain Foxconn exec seems to have been slightly too open about Apple\u2019s upcoming iPhone, via MyDrivers.\nIn a post to social networking site Weibo, that has since been deleted, Luo Zhongsheng said that the yield of Apple\u2019s unusually-shaped OLED screen is only 60%, as cutting to non-uniform size is difficult.\nHe goes on to predict that the iPhone 8 will be not be sold cheaply, given the higher manufacturing costs.\nThe special shape he is referring to is obviously the notch/forehead display we have seen leaked so much by now, even by Apple itself. The phone will be almost bezel-less on the left, bottom and right sides with the top center featuring a non-uniform cutout for the camera, earpiece and infrared sensors to reside.\nHere\u2019s a screengrab of the original post before it was pulled (rough translation: \u2018The OLED yield is only 60%! It looks like difficulty of special-shaped cutting is indeed great, the cost will not be cheap. Estimated iPhone 8 is not cheap.\u2019)\nRather amusingly, the Zhongsheng has a social media post from July 27th that blatantly discusses how companies are making bezel-less phones, even including a diagram of notch screen phone designs. The exec also corroborates supply chain reports that the OLED iPhone panel is being made by Samsung Display.\nSeparately, unconfirmed photos from Weibo depict a possible new case color for the iPhone 8. It\u2019s unclear whether these are supposed to be actual leaks of Apple case components or simply dummies made by a third party, but the choice of color scheme is interesting. Even if it is a dummy, they are often informed by real information coming from the supply chain.\nAlongside the typical black and white case colors, there is an iPhone supposedly touting a brand new color: copper gold. It\u2019s an interesting shade, not quite orange and not quite gold but somewhere in between. We can\u2019t confirm the nature of these pictures, but it\u2019s interesting to think about Apple changing up the available device finishes. More evidence of a new \u2018copper gold\u2019 color, beyond this single isolated set of photos, would be needed before giving it serious credibility.\nKGI\u2019s Ming-Chi Kuo has previously claimed that the OLED iPhone would be sold in fewer colors than current iPhone models, but did not exactly specify what variants Apple would offer. Other rumors have indicated the existence of a mirror finish iPhone 8 option, not portrayed in these recent photos.\nOne final image making the rounds this weekend is a supposed photo of a Foxconn facility, showing a box filled with new iPhone models that feature a rear fingerprint sensor.\nThe most likely explanation for this picture is that is fictional, or depicting a Chinese iPhone lookalike clone product. We give this image almost no credibility as an indicator of the 2017 iPhone lineup; we do not believe the iPhone 8 or iPhone 7s devices feature a rear fingerprint sensor. Apple has reportedly gone all-in on face recognition biometrics for the iPhone 8 and the 7s will continue to feature a physical Home Button on the front face.\nApple will announce the new iPhone lineup at a media event in September; invites for that event should go out later in August. Until then, expect more of these kind of leaks as production ramps. What do you think about the possible new \u2018copper gold\u2019 iPhone color?

        "title": "US Teens engage with iMessage more than any other social platform",
        "body": "Let\u2019s face reality: US Teens engage with iMessage more than any other social platform Giuseppe Stuto \u00b7 Follow Published in HackerNoon.com \u00b7 \u00b7 Aug 16, 2017 15 min read -- 12 Listen Share\nNo one really seems to talk about it or acknowledge it, but iMessage is where a lot of mobile usage is trending towards, particularly for Gen-Z, and there are many good reasons why.\nLet me preface this piece with three important points, a) the qualitative / quantitative observations I\u2019m talking about here are with direct regard to US based teens / Gen-Z, not international, b) full disclosure that our main product, Fam, is currently premised on the iMessage platform. By no means do I intend to be biased in anything I say with regard to iMessage (hard to believe, but trust me). These insights are based off of quantitative data and now years of observing Gen-Z behavior within the context of mobile, and c) given the limited public information on most of the platforms mentioned in this piece, I had to derive several data points based on the metrics that have been historically disclosed by these companies. You can find the references and derivations here.\nBefore diving into the actual qualities and data points surrounding iMessage itself, let\u2019s spend some time diving into some data on iPhones vs Androids and quickly dispel misleading assertions that drive our attention away from two important truths.\nMajority of US based teens have iPhones, and it\u2019s only trending upwards. Yes, really.\nFor some odd reason, too many times do I hear people baselessly point out that \u201cthere\u2019s no way\u201d most teens have iPhones. Citing \u2018obvious\u2019 reasons such as \u201cThey\u2019re just too expensive!\u201d or \u201cLook, Droid owns the overall market share!\u201d Although those two points may be true, it still doesn\u2019t change the fact that teens here in the US have made it very clear \u2014 today, they prefer iPhones. For the purposes of this entire article, US teens will be defined as individuals 10\u201319 years of age.\nPiper Jaffrey semiannual US teen survey (1)\nThe Piper Jaffrey data shows how commanding iPhones are in today\u2019s smartphone landscape for teens. This is in line with our various surveying here at Fam, in which we have approximated over the past year that 75% of US teens use iPhones. In terms of why this may be the case, there are several factors to consider: design, iTunes, network effects, and of course what we believe to be the most important one, iMessage.\nBy no means am I commenting on what device is better, more powerful, better looking, or any of that. Simply laying the groundwork for this thesis at large.\niMessage IS a social platform for teens. It\u2019s currently the center of their immediate, social universe.\nAnother thing that is far too often over looked is what iMessage actually is to teens. Given the trend over the past several years with the rise of various messaging apps, e.g. WhatsApp, Messenger, Snapchat, Kik, most people now glance over traditional SMS as being much of a social experience, and understandably so. The only problem is many people consciously / subconsciously view iMessage as synonymous to traditional SMS. I can see why this is the case \u2014 after all, iMessage is a pre-installed platform on every single iPhone so obviously it will naturally have a ton of engagement. But it being pre-installed should not be a reason to discount it, especially when taking into account the level of saturation within the Gen-Z demographic and its dynamic user experience to date (relative to traditional SMS). Of course this is more of a subjective premise, however, after first hand observing how teens use iMessage over the past few years it is clear that they treat it as much more than a basic text message delivery service. It\u2019s the center of their mobile social life, whether they themselves realize that or not.\nYes, they still spend hours on apps such as Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr, or whatever else, but they constantly come back to their iMessage chats, whether it be 1v1 or group chats. They see someone posted about a party on their Insta or Snap story, they go back to their iMessage group chat and talk about it. They get 100 likes within an hour on their latest upload to Insta, they go back to their iMessage group chat and talk about it. They see that two or more of their friends are \u2018live\u2019 in their group chat \u2014 they sit there for an hour worried about missing out on whatever conversation is going on that made the chat \u2018live\u2019 to begin with. This is a very unique yet common, hyper active use case that just doesn\u2019t exist on any other platform.\nI am purposely leaving out the more dynamic use cases that have become quite popular over the past year or two within iMessage of sending gifs, playing games, video expression, etc, and how they\u2019re only going to become more powerful as the platform itself progresses. I\u2019ll touch a little on that later on. What\u2019s important for now is that you have an idea of how immersed teens are within iMessage and the level of intimacy that exists within it relative to other social platforms among this core demographic (teens).\nThese are all great qualitative viewpoints, can we get into some data now?\nNow that we have safely established that the majority of US based teens have an iPhone and that iMessage, in theory at least, stands for more than just a basic SMS experience, let\u2019s see how it sizes up to some other popular US messaging platforms. The key to keep in mind here is that if you believe that teens behaviorally treat iMessage like a social experience and couple that with some of the iMessage app enhancements that Apple is implementing with this Fall\u2019s release of iOS 11, that the biggest function of this equation now becomes its current core usage relative to some of these other social messaging platforms that possess all the spotlight today.\nAfter exhaustively searching, it\u2019s surprising that no one has ever taken the time (to my knowledge) to compile these metrics in a comparative fashion to other popular messaging platforms. I\u2019ve done my best to keep this as much of an \u2018apples to apples\u2019 comparison by keeping all the platform data derived within the 2016 time period.\nDerived data, multiple sources (2\u20139)\nNote: There is more recent public data that can be used from Snap, such as how it now boasts 3B snaps sent per day, however, I am staying in line with my previously mentioned goal of keeping things within a snapshot of a similar time period as possible. We can all reasonably assume that the number of messages sent per day for each platform has grown since any time in 2016, which is the time period that the messages sent per day data is reported for. As for Messenger, it is important to keep in mind that given how common place having a Facebook account has become for all demographics, that the numbers cited may very well be higher than I derived. Feel free to jump into the references linked at the bottom to check my calculations \u2014 I did my best given the limited public data available. What matters here is to establish a high level framework for understanding the landscape itself.\nWhen comparing these three messaging platforms, if we view sending a message as the true core action, then iMessage on average is by far the more engaging messaging platform of these three. There is the fair argument to be made that Snap\u2019s core action isn\u2019t just sending a message and that it is now also posting / consuming a story and all the other rich content on the platform. In all honesty though, the root piece of engagement that commences and sustains the virtuous loop for most, if not all, social apps is some form of content creation, therefore, consumption becomes a consequential action. So long as the content is continuously created, the platform itself (or the developers building on that platform) can modify the environment to cater to a better consumption experience \u2014 this will in turn result in what I just described as a \u201cconsequential\u201d action. As the platform provider you can create a better consumption experience, but if you don\u2019t have users creating the content to begin with then you are out of luck.\nWe have now proven with data that iMessage is definitely up there with two of the other leaders in the US mobile messaging space, now what about within the context of teens? Well, unfortunately there\u2019s little direct evidence as to what proportion of overall usage is performed by teens, but most can empirically conclude that teens are the most active demographic when it comes to messaging and most other social mobile behaviors. For example, according to a Snapchat insider in late 2013 the more active users (teenagers) sent upwards of 50\u2013150 snaps per day \u2014 that\u2019s well over 6x-10x the current average number of snaps sent per user per day.\nWith this \u2018teens are generally more active\u2019 presumption in mind, it makes total sense that iMessage is ahead in terms of most messages sent on a per user and aggregate per day basis. Based on this data, there are several million more teens consistently active on iMessage than on Snapchat and Messenger as of 2016, and this IMO explains the big difference in general engagement (avg. messages sent per user per day). From a product capability standpoint, iMessage is behind Snap and Messenger with all the different bells and whistles, e.g. filters, and it still somehow manages to be ahead. The continued teen craze over iPhones coupled with the clear trend in iMessage becoming a more interactive social networking platform gives more than enough credibility to the argument that this is a central part of future teenage social mobile behavior, at least for the foreseeable future.\niMessage app drawer in new iOS 11 release, Photo Credit: iGeeksBlog, (10)\nOne of the biggest takeaways here is that all of this engagement on iMessage does not even factor in the impact that iMessage apps have had and will continue to have since it debuted in September 2016. Even if you assume that the iMessage apps that have been created to date for iMessage have had minimal impact, the network effect that exists within iMessage and the enhancements that are to come with iOS 11 setup a fantastic environment for providing an immersive messaging experience for teens.\nWhy is the focus only on apps whose core action is to send a message? What about Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, and Twitter?\nFor teens, the core level of activity is sending a message. Creating a post or uploading a photo somewhere is definitely engaging, however, back and forth messaging is the center of their lives and the way they have grown up for most aspects of their social life. But let us digress and look at the overall social networking landscape, including platforms whose core action is not to send an immediate direct / group message of sorts \u2014 this time, keeping in mind the key premise to this piece, that iMessage is a social platform.\nSource: eMarketer survey (11)\nSource: University of Chicago (12)\nI\u2019ve put two different sources of information here for the US teen high level social media breakdown. Reason for including both is because IMO this is the least substantiated statistic of all those which I\u2019ve cited given the nature of how this finding is typically determined, and because I felt it was important to show the possible shift / growth of each social media platform\u2019s teenage popularity from 2016 to 2017. I\u2019ve seen the eMarketer data cited more often relative to the University of Chicago data, but I\u2019ll leave it up to you to decide how you want to weigh it within that range. (Note: I did not use the University of Chicago, 2017 data as part of the previous teen user breakdown of Messenger and Snapchat because all the data cited in the previous section\u2019s appendix is from 2016.)\nWhen you put iMessage into context with other leading destination apps for teens and factor in the rate at which it is expected to grow over the next year or two (expected to jump to a 81% saturation rate as previously noted), regardless of which survey you look at iMessage is the consistent leader from a network saturation standpoint. As Sarah Tavel points out in her \u2018Hierarchy of Engagement\u2019 piece, the strongest virtuous loop for any social product is a network effect. The reason why you keep coming back to Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat day after day is primarily because you know that the clear majority of those who matter to you or who are in your closest network are on those platforms and they are actively using them.\nLet\u2019s apply this same logic to iMessage and let it sink in for a moment. 76% of US teens are on it today, 81% expect to be on it next year, and the iMessage platform itself is still in its infancy from an interactive framework standpoint. Not to mention, the switching cost of jumping ship on any of these social media platforms is a nano fraction that of just deciding to throw your iPhone away and getting a non-iOS smartphone. It\u2019s starting to sound like we may indeed be at the cusp of an iMessage revolution.\nLet\u2019s be real though, as with all things in life not everything when it comes to iMessage is rainbows and butterflies. You haven\u2019t mentioned time spent!\nDerived data, multiple sources (13\u201314)\nThere is no data on actual time spent within iMessage on a daily basis, so I went ahead and used WhatsApp as a proxy to derive that data. As of 2015, I was able to derive that approximately 29 minutes on average are spent on WhatsApp by the average user, sending on average 66 messages per day. I did quite a bit of digging and pro-rated estimations to come to the average messages sent per day figure, so feel free to dig into the citations if you\u2019re interested. Given that iMessage and WhatsApp had comparable features during the same time period snapshot, we will use the 2016 iMessage figures previously stated in which the average iMessage user sends 25 messages per day. For the purposes of these two messaging experiences in 2015, I think its reasonable to assume that messages sent per day is highly correlated to average time spent per day. Therefore, one can assume that the average time spent on iMessage per day is approximately 11 minutes (keep in mind that this is for the average iMessage user, not exclusively teens).\nSource: Recode (14)\nIf you take this overall user average of 11 minutes per day into context with arguably the two most engaging social mobile experiences for US teens today, Instagram and Snapchat, it is clear that iMessage is behind on a time spent per day basis. Time spent is definitely a strong function of the volume and quality of content shared on the respective platform and IMO the difference in the type of content shared between teens and non-teens on iMessage is drastically greater than the difference that exists on platforms such as Snapchat and Instagram, given the respective environments of each of these platforms. Instagram helps you make all of your posts beautiful and artistic in nature. Snapchat lets you add dynamic and highly interactive filters with just one tap. iMessage just isn\u2019t there, yet.\nThe richer the content that is created and shared on iMessage becomes, the longer the session times will become. iMessage has a lot of potential given that its developer platform is still less than a year old, but this potential will have to be materialized in the form of enhanced tools, presumably supplied by outside developers if it is to compete with the likes of Instagram and Snapchat on an overall time spent basis.\nOk we get it, iMessage is very important to teens on an overall basis, so what?\nWith the advent of critical technical advancements such as iOS 11, coupled with the aforementioned clear trend in both the popularity and usage surrounding iMessage, its important for people to recognize that this is a real movement. Take some anecdotal evidence, which I personally take as partially conclusive based on my experience and time working with this demographic:",
