        "body": "A file that Apple updated on its website last month provides the first acknowledgment that it's relying on Google 's public cloud for data storage for its iCloud services.\nThe disclosure is fresh evidence that Google's cloud has been picking up usage as it looks to catch up with Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud infrastructure business.\nSome media outlets reported on Google's iCloud win in 2016, but Apple never provided confirmation.\nApple periodically publishes new versions of a PDF called the iOS Security Guide. For years the document contained language indicating that iCloud services were relying on remote data storage systems from Amazon Web Services, as well as Microsoft's Azure.\nBut in the latest version, the Microsoft Azure reference is gone, and in its place is Google Cloud Platform. Before the January update, Apple most recently updated the iOS Security Guide in March.\nThe latest update doesn't indicate whether Apple is using any Google cloud services other than core storage of \"objects\" like photos and videos. The document also doesn't make it clear when Apple started storing data in Google's cloud. Microsoft declined to comment. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.\nEarlier this month Google said its public cloud and its G Suite line of cloud-based productivity apps contribute $1 billion in revenue per quarter. In the fourth quarter, market leader Amazon Web Services brought in $5.11 billion in revenue.\nIn addition to Apple, other Google public cloud customers include Kroger , PayPal , Snap and Spotify.",

        "body": "Article Hero Image\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S9 has a slower processor than the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X, according to early benchmarks of Samsung's new device, after tests of the Android smartphone's Exynos 9810 chip reveal it to lag far behind the Apple-created A10 and A11 processors.\nBenchmarking of a demonstration handset at the Samsung Galaxy S9 launch event by Anandtech shows the Exynos 9810 to be a fast chip, but not as fast as the A10 and A11. Across the battery of tests, Samsung's newest processor, unveiled in January, does outperform its predecessor, but Apple's chips continued to dominate in most of the results.\nAn initial GeekBench 4 single core test recorded integer and floating point scores of 3,734 and 3,440 respectively for the Exynos 9810, but by comparison the A11 scored 4,630 and 3,958 respectively. The A10 also beats Samsung's chip for the Integer score, achieving 4,007, but is just 95 points behind for floating point performance at 3,345.\nThere is no change in position between the three chips when breaking down the scores to a per-megahertz level, as comparing the integer scores reveal the Exynos 9810 scoring 1.38 per megahertz, while the A10 scores 1.71 per megahertz, rising to 1.94 for the A11. For the floating point score, it's the sames story, with the 9810 getting 1.27 points per megahertz compared to the 1.43 points of the A10 and 1.66 of the A11.\nGraph from Anandtech\nUsing different benchmarks for the phones themselves instead of narrowing down to the processor, the results stayed fairly similar with the iPhone 8 and iPhone X beating the Galaxy S9 Plus. Using WebXPRT 2015, the iPhone X and iPhone 8 score 352 and 349 respectively, almost double the 178 points achieved by the Galaxy S9 Plus.\nUnder Speedometer 2.0, the gap between the devices extends, as the Galaxy S9 Plus scored just 26.70 in the benchmark compared to the 88.90 of the iPhone 8 and 87.20 of the iPhone X.\nIn both of these tests, the iPhone 7 also manages to best the Galaxy S9 Plus, achieving 199 under WebXPRT 2015 and 55.20 under Speedometer 2.0.\nGraph from Anandtech\nAndrei Frumusanu of Anandtech believes there may have been an issue with the device being tested, as it was \"barely able to distinguish itself from last year's Exynos 8895.\" While noting the larger cores were reaching their maximum set clock speed, Frumusanu suggests it could be issues with the scheduler and the DVFS configuration that's causing the handset on show to underperform.\nA Samsung spokesperson did confirm that the demonstration units were running special firmware for Mobile World Congress, adding that it may not be optimized to the hardware as of yet. Frumusanu considers it hard to believe Samsung would limit the performance for their flagship smartphones for the show, nor that the company would alter its scheduler settings for the occasion.\nAnother notable element is that Samsung has clocked the four performance cores used in the Galaxy S9's processor at 2.7 gigahertz, down from the maximum 2.9 gigahertz claimed at the launch of the chip.\nTesting the Mali G72MP18 GPU included in the Galaxy S9 Plus revealed the same story, with its score of 45.70 peak frames per second on GFXBench Manhattan 3.1 beaten by the iPhone 8's 60.34 and the iPhone X's 64.19. Not much change was seen under the GFXBench T-Rex 2.7 test, with the Galaxy S9 Plus peaking at 143.4 frames per second while the iPhone 8 and iPhone X got 171.4 and 176.6 peak framerates.",

The combined Samsung-Amazon total of 41.6 million tablets is 2.2 million lower than iPad sales.\nApple captured a 26.8 percent share of the tablet market in 2017, meaning that roughly one in every four tablets sold last year was an iPad. Apple's tablet market share rose 2.5 percentage points year-on-year.\nLast week, Apple reported revenue of $5.8 billion from iPad sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing growth of six percent compared to the year-ago quarter. Apple's average selling price of an iPad was $445, up slightly from $423 in year-ago quarter, suggesting more higher-priced iPad Pro sales.\nApple's growth in iPad sales, albeit relatively flat, contrasted with the overall tablet market's 6.5 percent decline in shipments in 2017 compared to 2016. iPad has been the world's most popular tablet since shortly after it launched.\nShifting focus to this year, Apple is rumored to launch at least one new iPad Pro model with slimmer bezels, no home button, and Face ID. We haven't heard much about the lower-cost 9.7-inch iPad and iPad mini, but each could certainly receive a routine speed bump this year among other upgrades as well.",

Initially purchased in 2014 as part of a $160 million program to modernize police operations, the Nokia phones running Windows Phone will be collected, wiped and sold back to the company.\nThe move to iPhone 7 comes at no cost to the NYPD, as the handsets are considered upgrades under the agency's contract with AT&T.\nNYPD's rollout began last month when officers patrolling the Bronx and Staten Island swapped their obsolete Nokia smartphones for Apple devices. The department is handing out about 600 iPhones per day, according to NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Information and Technology Jessica Tisch.\nOfficers armed with iPhone will be able to access 911 dispatches, perform criminal background checks, access criminal histories when responding to calls, view video and surveillance photos, and fill out beat reports. The smartphones also make patrolling much safer, as cops responding to a job are provided detailed information about a given address and its potential dangers.\n\"I truly feel like it's the ultimate tool to have as a patrol cop,\" said officer Christopher Clampitt. \"We get to the location a lot quicker,\" he said. \"By the time the dispatcher puts out the job (on the radio) we're already there.\"\nNYPD dispatches are pushed to the department's 911 app before they reach radios, and can be geofenced to reach only those officers located in a specific neighborhood. Last year, for example, Clampitt and his partner were alerted to, and stopped, a robbery in progress before the dispatcher put word out over radio channels.",

        "title": "The size of iphone apps has increased by 1000% in 4 years",
        "body": "As the minimum storage capacity of iPhone continues to increase\u2014it sits at 32 GB today on the iPhone 7, double the the iPhone 5S's 16 GB circa 2013\u2014it's not surprising that the size of apps themselves is getting larger. In fact, Apple raised the app size cap from 2 GB to 4 GB in early 2015. What's surprising is how much faster they're increasing in size compared to device storage itself.\nAccording to Sensor Tower's analysis of App Intelligence, the total space required by the top 10 most installed U.S. iPhone apps has grown from 164 MB in May 2013 to about 1.9 GB last month, a 12x or approximately 1,100 percent increase in just four years. In the following report, we delve deeper into which apps have grown the most.\nMost Growth Has Occurred in the Past Year\nAs you can see in the chart below, while none of the top 10 apps\u2014which include Facebook, Uber, Gmail, Snapchat, Spotify, Messenger, Google Maps, YouTube, Instagram, and Netflix\u2014are larger than a few hundred megabytes individually, they all began to increase in size after Apple raised the maximum app size to 4 GB in February 2015.\nBefore this point, apps were limited to a maximum of 2 GB, with the core executable capped at 100 MB of that (the latter is still the case). Of course, apps can take up additional storage on a user's device; Apple's limit applies to what can be initially downloaded from the App Store. For the purposes of our analysis, we only looked at the core app size, not the total storage footprint of an app plus additional content.\nAlso noticeable above is a further acceleration in app size increase following the September 2016 rollout of iOS 10, but as we'll get to in the next section, there's a more specific reason for a lot of this growth among the top 10 apps in particular.\nSome Apps Have Grown More Than Others\nOf the top 10 most popular U.S. iPhone apps, the minimum growth we saw in app size since May 2013 was 6x for Spotify. As the chart above shows, other apps, especially Snapchat, have grown considerably more.\nIn fact, Snapchat is more than 50 times larger than it was four years ago, clocking in at 203 MB versus just 4 MB at the start of the period we looked at. It's not the largest app among the top 10, however. That distinction goes to Facebook, which, at 388 MB, is 12 times larger than it was in May 2013 when it occupied 32 MB. It grew by about 100 MB in one update during September of last year.\nGmail is another standout in terms of sudden app size growth, having grown from 41 MB last October to 197 MB in November (an almost 5x or 380 percent increase) after a redesign.\nWe see the often sudden growth in size exhibited by apps such as Facebook and Snapchat as directly tied to the intense competition between them, which necessitates a steady rollout of new and more space-intensive features. Of course, some apps have likely grown in size simply due to a reduced need (or perception of a need) for optimization.\nGames Grew Too, As Expected\nUnlike an email app, mobile games are expected to increase in size as both their complexity and the amount (and quality) of their audiovisual content increases over time to match the fidelity of the newest devices.\nLooking at two specific examples, the ever-popular top 10 title Clash of Clans has grown from 49 MB to 116 MB over this period (a bit more than 2x) and Candy Crush Saga has grown about 4.6x from 48 MB to 223 MB. Meanwhile, the initial download for a graphically cutting-edge game, such as the recently launched Injustice 2, sits at 1 GB\u2014more than the entire top 10 grossing list from May 2013.\nApple's Answer: Smarter Storage\nApple is clearly aware of the storage requirements being placed on modern iOS devices by developers. In fact, iOS 11 will introduce new features to help users make the most of the storage they have, including offering suggestions about infrequently used apps and the option to offload them\u2014removing the core app while retaining all its settings and data for when they're needed again. This should help owners of storage-strapped devices and those whose downloading habits are well above average.",

I noticed it was still showing up in my Find My iPhone app. Well, at first I didn\u2019t realize it was that particular Mac. I just happened to notice there was a computer I didn\u2019t recognize in Find My iPhone called \u201cMichael\u2019s iMac\u201d.\nI clicked in and saw a computer that wasn\u2019t mine showing up on a map about 100 miles north of my house.\nblurred for privacy\nI vaguely remembered selling an iMac on Craigslist 3 years ago, and figured that was this one. Then I realized that meant for over 3 years, I had access to this person\u2019s exact location. That\u2019s insane to me.\nHow the hell did that happen?\nBefore selling, I erased the computer and re-installed a fresh MacOS\nI did a hard erase of the computer and reinstalled MacOS factory fresh. The mistake I made was that before erasing the computer, I didn\u2019t sign out of iCloud / Find My Mac. I figured erasing the computer would do that. It didn\u2019t.\nI sold the computer and the user didn\u2019t log into iCloud\nFor whatever reason, this person didn\u2019t need to sign into iCloud. So this meant that Apple still associated the computer hardware with my iCloud account. The computer wasn\u2019t logged into my iCloud account, but was still associated with my account, so I still could track the computer\u2019s location in real time.\nFor me (the seller), this isn\u2019t much of a security risk\nThe buyer won\u2019t see or have access to any private iCloud data; the hardware is just associated with it. But the seller can\u2019t disassociate it without the buyer\u2019s help (and I didn\u2019t have any way to contact them), so it\u2019s a pain.\nNo, logging all devices out of iCloud doesn\u2019t work. And no, this has nothing to do with if the computer is in your Support Profile.\nThe only options I had were Play Sound, Lock, and Erase.\nFor the buyer, there are massive privacy concerns\nThe biggest privacy issue is for the buyer.

        "title": "Truly wireless earbuds haven\u2019t caught up to AirPods after more than a year",
        "body": "AirPods are the best truly wireless earbuds available because they nail the essentials like ease of use, reliability, and battery life. There are alternatives that definitely sound better from Bose, B&O Play, and other. But they often cost more and all of them experience occasional audio dropouts. AirPods don\u2019t. I\u2019d argue they\u2019re maybe the best first-gen product Apple has ever made. Unfortunately, I\u2019m one of the sad souls whose ears just aren\u2019t a match for the AirPods \u2014 and I\u2019m a nerd who likes having both an iPhone and Android phone around \u2014 so I\u2019ve been searching for the best non-Apple option.\nBut some 14 months after AirPods shipped, there\u2019s still no clear cut competitor that\u2019s truly better at the important stuff. They all lack the magic sauce that is Apple\u2019s W1 chip, which improves pairing, range, and battery life for the AirPods. At this point I think it\u2019s fair to say that Bluetooth alone isn\u2019t enough to make these gadgets work smoothly. Hopefully the connection will be more sturdy once more earbuds with Bluetooth 5 hit the market. And Qualcomm is also putting in work to help improve reliability.\nThat\u2019s not to say these options are all terrible; they\u2019re not. If you\u2019re using them in a place where you\u2019re unlikely to deal with much signal interference, several are fine choices. Samsung, Sony, Bragi, Bose, and others are worth looking at. Each has its own advantages and drawbacks. All of them are more flexible in regards to fit with different options (including Comply foam tips in some cases). The Bose SoundSport Free has the best bass response of the bunch, for example, but they\u2019re basically useless for video since there\u2019s a substantial audio delay. That\u2019s an issue shared by several of these, and some of them only route phone calls to one ear, which can be annoying. A few provide built-in fitness tracking, but I\u2019ve got enough devices that are capable of that. I just want the things to work great and sound nice. The second half is already there \u2014 and many of these earbuds let you customize the EQ \u2014 but I need rock-solid playback.",

        "title": "Designing a better notification experience for iOS [Concept]",
        "body": "Designing a better notification experience for iOS\nAs a huge tech fan and someone that works in the industry, I own of a lot of gadgets, especially smartphones. I have devices that run Android, Windows or even Ubuntu Touch, however my daily driver is an iPhone X simply because iOS is by far my favourite operating system to use. It works seamlessly with my Mac and iPad, it receives frequent software updates and the quality of apps in the store is just great. I really like the ecosystem, however there are some areas it could definitely improve on. This article is about exploring some of the opportunities around the current notification system to make it even better.\nThe problem\nThe iOS 11 notification system, oh boy. Especially the messages that sit on your lock screen. They play such a big role in the user experience of your phone. We spend around 4 hours on our phones every day. We have multiple apps installed that constantly try to communicate with us in a form of a notification and processing all that information can be quite overwhelming.\nIncoming messages on a normal day on iOS (courtesy of WeezyWally)\nI\u2019d love if my phone could help me filter out the noise and understand all these messages quickly and easily. The way the current system works just seem to make people frustrated. A lot of users complain about this information overload and how much they would love this to be fixed on iOS. You can find threads and videos where people express their strong opinions on the matter as notifications can be quite unreadable in this current form.\nMany apps don\u2019t follow the Apple guidelines either and send out multiple, repetitive notifications meaning that frequency is definitely something iOS needs to start optimizing for. There are just so many opportunities for improvements.\nAt the moment single notifications take up a lot space visually \u2014 and depending on your device \u2014 even 4 notifications can fill up your whole lock screen. When you have double or triple this amount, you will then enter the scrolling game and it becomes very easy to miss messages.\nCurrent iOS 11 Notifications\nIf you\u2019re a light user or limit the number of notifications you receive, you\u2019re probably okay with this current system. As humans we get used to things, even if it\u2019s not well designed. However if you're a heavy user and receive dozens of new notifications a day, you\u2019re starting to see why this is such a problem, its almost a guarantee that it will make you frustrated.\nThe current solution to this today is to switch notifications off completely or change your preferences within the apps, but none of these seem to the best ways to approach the problem as you will be missing out on quite a lot that might be relevant to you. I believe there are 2 better ways this could be solved and it wouldn't require an entire restuctre from Apple to build this on top of iOS 11.\nGroup by App\nFirst off: the \u2018Group by App\u2019 feature. A couple years ago iOS 9 had this option and allowed you to group notifications by app. Why was this good? Well, messages were much easier to read through as they were organzied in such a nice manner. It was just easier to undertsand what\u2019s going on and what really needs your attention. Meaningless notifications were easier to dismiss and important ones stood out more. But the decision was in your hands and you were in control on how you prioritise.\niOS 9 Notifications\nAnd because of that, I knew that many long-time users already had an idea of this system, how it works and why to use so this was definitely an inspiration.\nI\u2019ve tried to look at dozens of different variations and ways to go about solving the problem for the sake of making sure the solution is as simple, intuitive and familiar as possible. These 3 pillars were always at the front of my thinking.\nVersion 1\nI\u2019ve been thinking about how version 1 of this new feature might work in iOS 11 because I didn\u2019t want to drastically change the current system so the learning curve would be smaller for users. Bigger changes could be rolled out overtime, incrementally if needed.\nSo what changes would be absolutely essential for the first release?\nPen and paper is still my favourite approach to sketch out some rough ideas to see what solutions I can come up with. After heavy research, I\u2019ve had a few iterations that looked quite good on paper and made a lot of sense so I decided to turn them into wireframes. I\u2019ve used Sketch Mirror to send these to my phone and see how it feels. There were around 4 versions that also made it into a prototype in an attempt to try to making it even more realistic.\nBut like I mentioned before, the solution had to be simple, intuitive and familiar, so many just didn\u2019t fit all 3. They either wouldn\u2019t fit the current visual style, wouldn\u2019t accommodate some edge-cases or were quite tricky to quickly understand how it works. However I had two at the \u2018end\u2019 that stood the challenge so I went onto testing it with a wide range of apps to see if the framework would fit them but also emailed a bunch of people that I know uses an iPhone to gather some intial feedback from them. Finally I had something I could work with.\nLimitations\nWhat made this excersise challenging was the limitations. Notifications have to fit many different needs so there are a lot of them. They have work cross-platform (Mac, iPad, Watch, iPhone), fit the current visual system, be intuitive and most importantly, accommodate the needs of so many applications and use cases. Some apps send short and concise messages, some like to attach rich media files and add a lot of text that makes them large and look crowded.\nAnd then there are also times when you have several notifications from multiple senders within the same app or have a dozen from only one sender, how would you group those? What if you have have 20 or 30 incoming messages from one app only, how would that look like? But there are so much more I probably wouldn\u2019t even know without working there like technicaly constraints.\nThe new system\nKeeping all of the above in mind, I\u2019ve created a new system that I believe works well across all of these scenarios. Compared to iOS 11, the changes are not drastic for single notifications. I brought the header back from iOS 10 so it looks somewhat similar to the current widgets. I have also moved the timestamp into the content area to indicate when a specific notification was sent out and also create space for expand indicator which I will explain later in the multiple notifications section. Slight, but very important changes.\nA closer look\nLet\u2019s take a look at the notification breakdown. This is the anatomy of individual notifications so you would only see this them in this form if you receive less then 2 notification from one app or not have the Group by App feature enabled at all.\nI separated the notification into 2 parts: header and content. Every notifications will have both of these areas. The header helps seperate the app and its content so now theres more focus on the latter. By simply removing the timestamps from the header and attaching it to the content itself, we now have the opportunity to place multiple messages into the content area instead of just a single one but it also makes room for expand indicator in the header when we it comes to grouping messages.\nLike I mentioned before, iOS 9 allowed you to group notifications by app as an optional feature and I would be bringing this back. A single on/off toggle that would easily active or deactivate the grouping feature. Not everyone would prefer this system so having flexibility is definitely great.\nNow let\u2019s look at how the grouping would actually look like. After you enable the \u2018Group by App\u2019 toggle in Settings, you will need to receive at least 2 notifications from one app to see the grouped container appear. Notifications would be merged by creating 1 container that holds all of the content inside. It would have the app header and counter in the content area with the amount of unread notifications you currently have. You would also see an expand indicator appear (Show More/Show Less) which looks and works the same way as it would for a widget.\nAnd with this, now you have the option to open the container to see more or keep them hidden depening on your preferences. One thing to mention here is that once messages are grouped, you won\u2019t be able to interact with individual messages (quick response, archive etc), so any action you now take would affect the whole group as one. Open, respond, clear etc. I felt that when you have multiple notifications, the two most common actions would be to open the app or dismiss the messages so I didn\u2019t think the need for that level of detail would be essential for version 1.\nThis is how it looks like in action when you only have a few messages grouped:\nSmall group\nAnother use case of this feature is when you receive 10 or more notifications from one app. In this case you will have a call-to-action indicating the total amount and prompting you to open the app to see all of them. Chances are, when you have that many, you would like to react to them so you would need to open the app or dismiss all you don\u2019t have to think about it at that moment.\nThis version would allow you to do both. A single swipe can get rid of all your grouped notifications instead of having to close each of them one by one. And all the notifications are in order with the most recent on top so you can be up-to-date on your lock screen just like today.\nLarge group\nAnd now instead of a long list, you have a much cleaner and organised look. Of course, your screen could still look very crowded if you receive a lot of messages, but it\u2018s much easier and less time consuming to go through the list when the information you see in front of you is well-organized.\nCurrent iOS 11 vs New Group by App feature\nMute notifications\nAnother feature the \u2018Group by App\u2019 system would make possible is the to option mute or snooze notifications temporarily for a short period of time.\nOn iOS 11, you have the option to disable all easily if you really want to focus on something. Apple introduced the Do Not Disturb While Driving mode not long ago which is great and very useful, but I would love to see even more flexibility. What if you\u2019re working, studying or doing something else that requires a level of focus? An on/off solution doesn\u2019t always work well in all situations and muting only certain notifications would come very handy at times. It would give you more flexibility and even more control of you lock screen.\nLet\u2019s say you upload a new photo to Instagram or tweet something that receives a lot of attention for an hour or two. You will receive a ton on new notifications and it can quickly become very annoying. At the moment its a very binary option, you either have notifications turned on or turned off so you decide completely disable them then you have re-enable them later on. Every app, every time.\nI think this feature could be introduced quite seamlessly once you have the \u2018Group by App\u2019 system enabled as it would sit nicely in the swipe left gesture, in-between the current View and Clear options. One you select it, a simple modal could prompt you to select a timeframe you would like to mute them for and all done. Users could also change or revert changes in Settings anytime they prefer.\nI believe that with the combination of these two features, it would be a pretty good first step into making the overall user experience even better and provide a system that honestly cares about the people behind these devices and value their time more.\nThere are of course more features that could make the notification system even better that I didn\u2019t touch on this time like security, better quick action gestures or notification sounds/lights to keep it shorter, but I see myself touching on those points as well later on.\nFeedback\nI realise that this might be a quick fix and woud need some further research and testing to be done in order to find a truly great system that works even more seamlessly, however I do not work for Apple so this is just a brief suggestion. And I\u2019m sure they\u2019re already working on this.\nAlso, I would love to hear your feedback.\nIf you\u2019re an iPhone user or someone that works at Apple, do you think this is a problem? If so, what do you think of this solution?\nThank you for reading and don\u2019t forget to say hi on Twitter!",

Artificial intelligence is also a point of advantage for Apple, where Fast Company says the company \u201chas made major inroads\u201d despite competition from Google and Amazon.\nSpecifically, Fast Company notes Apple\u2019s privacy-centric approach to artificial intelligence, where most of the work is done on the device itself:\nFor instance, it uses AI techniques to wring as much life as possible out of the iPhone\u2019s battery. Because of Apple\u2019s privacy-driven decision to limit the amount of information it aggregates and analyzes in the cloud, it also does much of its AI right on the devices rather than using massive server farms.\nComing in behind Apple on the most innovative company list is Netflix in second place, Square in third, Tencent in fourth, and Amazon \u2013 last year\u2019s winner \u2013 in fifth.

        "body": "According to Cardiogram founder Brandon Ballinger\u2019s latest clinical study, the Apple Watch can detect diabetes in those previously diagnosed with the disease with an 85 percent accuracy.\nThe study is part of the larger DeepHeart study with Cardiogram and UCSF. This particular study used data from 14,000 Apple Watch users and was able to detect that 462 of them had diabetes by using the Watch\u2019s heart rate sensor, the same type of sensor other fitness bands using Android Wear also integrate into their systems.\nIn 2015, the Framingham Heart Study showed that resting heart rate and heart rate variability significantly predicted incident diabetes and hypertension. This led to the impetus to use the Watch\u2019s heart rate sensor to see if it could accurately detect a diabetic patient.\nPreviously, Ballinger and his colleagues were able to use Apple\u2019s Watch to detect an abnormal heart rhythm with up to a 97 percent accuracy, sleep apnea with a 90 percent accuracy and hypertension with an 82 percent accuracy when paired with Cardiogram\u2019s AI-based algorithm. Most of these discoveries have been published in clinical journals or abstracts and Ballinger intends to publish the latest findings shortly after presenting at the AAAI 2018 conference this week.\nDiabetes is a huge \u2014 and growing \u2014 problem in the U.S. More than 100 million U.S. adults are now living with pre-diabetes or diabetes and more than 1 in 4 of them go undiagnosed, according to the CDC. Part of the problem is the pain that goes into checking blood glucose levels. A patient must prick themselves after every meal and correctly take the right amount of insulin to keep themselves in balance.\nEarly detection could also help in cutting down on diabetes-related diseases before they get out of hand. While there have been other attempts to build special-purpose glucose-sensing hardware, this is the first large-scale study showing that ordinary heart rate sensors\u2014when paired with an artificial intelligence-based algorithm\u2014can identify diabetes with no extra hardware.\nSo what\u2019s next? Ballinger and his colleague on the study Johnson Hsieh mentioned they could be looking at a number of diseases to detect through heart sensors, possibly even gestational diabetes. Hsieh also cautions that those tested were already known to have diabetes or pre-diabetes and that anyone who thinks they might have it should go to their doctor, not just rely on the Watch to tell them what\u2019s going on.\nBut the results are promising. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see what else the Apple Watch and other fitness monitors with a built-in heart rate sensor are able to tell us about ourselves next.",

If so, how many?\nGood news for Apple employees: the HomePod will be 50% off for next two months. They previously did this for the Apple Watch when it launched. \u2014 Mark Gurman (@markgurman) February 3, 2018\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "Berkshire Hathaway doubles down on Apple stock and dumps IBM",
        "body": "Warren Buffett's conglomerate has increased its stake in Apple \u2014 and gotten rid of almost its entire IBM stake \u2014 a big move for a legendary investor who rarely bets on tech.\nBerkshire Hathaway revealed Wednesday that it increased its Apple holdings by 23.3 percent to 165.3 million shares, according to SEC filings, and dumped about 94.5 percent of its IBM holdings, leaving just 2.05 million shares.\nLast year, Buffett told CNBC that he was more sure about Apple's future than IBM's, and that he has continued to put his money where his mouth is (even if he still carries a flip phone).\nIn November, Berkshire reported that it cut its IBM stake by 32 percent, and upped its Apple stake. Before Wednesday's revelation, Berkshire was already the fourth-largest Apple shareholder, according to FactSet.\n\"IBM is a big strong company, but they've got big strong competitors too,\" Buffett told CNBC last year.\nStill, Berkshire's latest announcement comes at an interesting time for both Apple and IBM.\nRivals in the 1980s, IBM and Apple have taken very different paths over the years: IBM has struggled with trends in enterprise technology, while Apple has become a dominant force in consumer electronics.\nBut Big Blue revenue grew in January for the first time in 23 quarters, perhaps a sign that the company's pivot to analytics, cloud, mobile and security has taken hold. Wall Street-darling Apple, meanwhile, has faced an unusual level of criticism, amid product issues like production delays, security patches and battery replacements.\nIBM told CNBC that it doesn't comment on specific shareholders, but the company is \"very focused on delivering shareholder value.\"\n\"That's why we have shifted our investment strategy to drive leadership in the key, high-value segments valued by our clients, including Cloud, AI, security, blockchain and quantum technologies,\" IBM said.",
