        "title": "Apple is becoming an ad company despite privacy claims",
        "body": "Published on November 24, 2022\nFor years, Apple watched Google and Meta make billions by collecting every scrap of people\u2019s data to target them with ads. Now it appears it was just taking notes.\nApple\u2019s advertising operation follows the surveillance capitalism model of its rivals, using data it collects from various Apple services and your Apple account to show you ads in the App Store as well as its News and Stocks apps. Notably, these are all platforms or services that Apple has complete control over, allowing it to lock out its competitors.\nApple currently brings in roughly $4 billion from advertising(new window) and is forecasted to bring in as much as $30 billion by 2026(new window). While these amounts are an order of magnitude smaller than the $210 billion Google made from its ad services, they represent a change in philosophy for Apple, which only earned around $300 million for ads in 2017(new window).\nThis new emphasis on advertising also undermines Apple\u2019s claims about privacy with its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature and its \u201cPrivacy. That\u2019s iPhone\u201d ad campaign. In fact, it appears ATT may have been more about blocking competitors than protecting user privacy. Since Apple introduced ATT, its ad revenue has skyrocketed, leading German regulators to investigate(new window) Apple to see if it\u2019s abusing its power.\nHow Apple\u2019s tracking works\nOn Nov. 20, a pair of iOS developers known as Mysk(new window) discovered that Apple has a specific identifier (a \u201cdirectory services identifier\u201d or DSID) for every Apple iCloud account. It uses DSID to collect detailed information about your behavior in Apple apps and the App Store, and there\u2019s no way for you to turn it off.\n6/6\nIt is worth noting that the DSID is also sent by other Apple apps for analytics purposes.\nYou just need to know three things:\n1- The App Store sends detailed analytics about you to Apple\n2- There's no way to stop it\n3- Analytics data are directly linked to you \u2014 Mysk \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea (@mysk_co) November 21, 2022 (new window)\nThis technically doesn\u2019t violate Apple\u2019s privacy policy because it has multiple privacy policies, one for its device, one for the App Store, and one for each Apple app. The Apple device privacy policy(new window) states that Apple doesn\u2019t collect personal information or it anonymizes it.\nHowever, the privacy policies for the App Store(new window) and the Apple News(new window) and Stocks(new window) apps all state plainly that those services collect a wealth of information about your \u201cbrowsing, purchases, searches, and downloads\u201d. It goes on to say, \u201cThese records are stored with IP address, a random unique identifier (where that arises), and Apple ID when you are signed in to the App Store or other Apple online stores\u201d.\nApple monitors your every move in the App Store and its News and Stocks apps and then uses that data to sell ads targeting you in those same apps. To meet its growth forecasts, experts expect Apple to start selling ads in its Maps, Podcast, and Books apps, meaning it could replicate this model across more of its services. Much more of your activity could be monitored in the future.\nYou can disable ad personalization on your iPhone. However, this doesn\u2019t prevent the App Store or News and Stocks apps from collecting and using your data, nor does it prevent Apple from using other information it has on you, such as your network provider or device type, for ads.\nApple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency and walled garden give it an ad-vantage\nThis all might seem surprising given Apple\u2019s various claims about privacy, \u201cWhat happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone\u201d, and ATT. However, ATT targeted a very specific niche of data collection. An app only needs to ask your permission to collect data if it has trackers that follow you outside the app(new window) onto another app or website. ATT doesn\u2019t prevent companies from monitoring your activity within an app and collecting that data, like Apple does with the App Store and its News and Stocks apps.\nStill, this limited tracker blocking has had an effect. Meta predicted it would lose $10 billion in ad revenue(new window) in 2022 because of ATT. Twitter, Snap, YouTube, and data brokers have also complained that ATT gives Apple an unfair advantage. But Apple\u2019s walled garden is equally important to Apple\u2019s rapidly forming ad empire.\nTake the App Store as an example. The App Store is the only way to get apps on your iPhone or iPad. Now that third-party trackers have been eliminated, Apple is the only company that has access to users\u2019 behavior in the App Store. And it is using its data and captive audience to great effect. According to reports, Apple\u2019s search ads in the App Store were responsible for driving 58% of app downloads(new window) attributable to ads in Sept. 2021, up from 13% in Jan. 2020.\nApple wants to keep your data for itself\nUnfortunately, this is another example of Big Tech introducing privacy measures that prevent competitors from accessing your data so that it can keep it all for itself. To these companies, privacy means \u201cno one can access your information but us\u201d.\nThis type of reasoning eventually spills over into other fields as well. Apple originally made its name by offering an unrivaled user experience on its devices. However, the logic of a walled garden means you can serve ads in places you know people must go and where no competitors can reach. That\u2019s how you end up with ads in a Settings menu.\nSettings in iOS is now a place for ads. Just awful. The part I care about is pushed to third place. This is what happens when pushing services becomes more important than providing me with the best computing experience. pic.twitter.com/GyGt4uQQ5M(new window) \u2014 Ken Kocienda (@kocienda) August 4, 2022 (new window)\nRight now, Big Tech is telling internet users they can choose which data captor they want and calling it freedom. But the only way to be truly free and private is to choose services that treat you like a person rather than a product.\nWe began Proton, not because we wanted to find the most efficient way to sell ads, but because we wanted to give everyone the ability to protect and control their information. We don\u2019t want your data, which is why we encrypt as much of it as possible and only make money through paid subscriptions to our premium plans.\nAt Proton, privacy means what it really means. No one but you can access your information. Period.",

        "title": "Elon Musk Will Make an \u2018Alternative Phone\u2019 if Apple, Google Boot the Twitter App",
        "body": "Elon Musk said on Friday afternoon that he will \u201cmake an alternative phone\u201d if Apple or Google decide to kick Twitter off the App Store or Play Store, their respective mobile app marketplaces.\n\u201cI certainly hope it does not come to that, but, yes, if there is no other choice, I will make an alternative phone,\u201d Musk said in a Friday tweet, responding to a question on the subject from political commentator and podcast host Elizabeth Wheeler.\nI certainly hope it does not come to that, but, yes, if there is no other choice, I will make an alternative phone \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 25, 2022\nMusk last week hired George \u201cGeohot\u201d Hotz, the original iPhone hacker, who could probably help if it ever comes to that.\nPhil Schiller, an Apple Fellow and the company\u2019s App Store chief, deactivated his Twitter account sometime after Musk\u2019s takeover of the social network last month. Schiller\u2019s departure provides a window into what at least one high-ranking Apple executive thinks about Musk\u2019s Twitter.\nBloomberg\u2018s Mark Gurman said last week that Musk\u2019s plans to turn Twitter into a \u201csubscription service\u201d could eventually lead to the company clashing with Apple and Google over their exorbitant App Store and Play Store commissions.\nMusk has publicly criticized Apple\u2019s 30% take of all App Store transactions in the past. It\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll want to give 30 cents of every dollar Twitter makes through its planned subscriptions to Apple or Google.\nAlthough Twitter has indefinitely delayed the relaunch of its $9.99 CAD Twitter Blue subscription with account verification, Musk has made it clear he wants to monetize the platform with subscriptions. Twitter\u2019s advertising revenue has dipped significantly as of late, and the company is crunched for cash.\nThere\u2019s a real (albeit small) chance that Musk\u2019s Twitter could end up suffering the same fate as Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite and being booted from the App Store and Play Store \u2014 if not for butting heads with Apple and Google over their commission on sales, then for content moderation if things on the platform get too wild.\nMusk last week began reinstating Twitter accounts that had previously been permanently suspended for various offences. He started by unbanning comedian Kathy Griffin, Canadian media personality Jordan Peterson, and satirical news publication The Babylon Bee, but he also reinstated former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s account about a day later.\nTwitter\u2019s new owner and CEO has also announced a new \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d policy for Twitter, although that doesn\u2019t guarantee \u201cfreedom of reach\u201d for anything users post on the platform.\nWhat do you think an \u201calternative phone\u201d developed by Musk would look like?

        "title": "Spotify is going to war with Apple after the App Store rejected its big new feature",
        "body": "New York CNN Business \u2014\nSpotify is looking to give Apple a good bruising in the press.\nThe music streamer is taking its grievances with the Silicon Valley goliath public, openly lashing out at the company over a dispute that centers on the 30% App Store fee Apple charges for in-app digital services transactions.\n\u201cWe are talking about this because it is reflective of Apple\u2019s anti-competitive practices across the board,\u201d Harry Clarke, associate general counsel and Spotify\u2019s lead competition lawyer, told CNN in an interview Tuesday.\nHere\u2019s the backstory: Spotify (SPOT) simply refuses to fork over the whopping 30% cut of its business to Apple. That means that the company cannot sell audiobooks, a business it is trying to break into, inside its iOS app. Spotify (SPOT), instead, came up with three workarounds, which it believed were consistent with Apple\u2019s policies. But they were all ultimately rejected after undergoing reviews for the App Store, forcing the company to essentially abandon offering its customers an avenue for audiobook purchases in its iOS app.\nA version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\nThe effect is clear to would-be book buyers. iOS users who scroll through Spotify\u2019s audiobooks library and tap on a selection are greeted with a message: \u201cWant to listen? You can\u2019t buy audiobooks in the app. We know it\u2019s not ideal.\u201d (Apple, of course, also sells audiobooks via its pre-installed Apple Books.)\nWhile Spotify has no real recourse to compel Apple to accept its app featuring its audiobooks workaround, it is using the skirmish to assail Apple in the media and focus attention on the company\u2019s 30% in-app tax, which has long been criticized by the streamer and others. In recent days, Spotify has issued a blistering press release and participated in a lengthy story about the matter with The New York Times.\n\u201cWe think it is critical that users, policymakers, and competition authorities really understand what is happening,\u201d Clarke explained when asked about why Spotify is creating so much noise around the issue. \u201cBecause we have found that once they do understand what is happening, there is almost unanimous agreement that it is unfair.\u201d\nClarke said it is important for the company to raise the issue in the press because Spotify users might not understand why the audiobooks experience in the iOS app is so cumbersome. \u201cOne of the challenges of Apple\u2019s rules is that they effectively put a gag order on us to talk about this in the app,\u201d Clarke said, adding that many users \u201caren\u2019t aware\u201d of the back-and-forth the company has had with Apple.\nApple, for its part, is not directly addressing Spotify\u2019s PR campaign against it. The company referred CNN to a general statement about the dispute, in which it said that it had \u201cno issue with reader apps adding audiobook content,\u201d but that Spotify\u2019s workaround \u2014 its in-app purchase method \u2014 broke its rules.\nSpotify\u2019s public war on Apple is part of a larger trend lately, with other Big Tech companies taking aim at the iPhone maker. Mark Zuckerberg recently took a shot at Apple\u2019s iMessage security features, arguing that his WhatsApp is more secure. And Google has been hammering Apple for refusing to play ball with Android on texting.\nAnd it\u2019s unlikely these types of pressure campaigns will fizzle out anytime soon. Spotify said that it plans to continue to publicly pressure Apple on the matter. \u201cWe are going to continue to amplify this issue,\u201d Clarke said, \u201cto help people understand the negative impact Apple\u2019s policies are having.\u201d",

        "title": "New EU Law Could Force Apple to Allow Other App Stores, Sideloading, and iMessage Interoperability",
        "body": "New EU rules came into force today that could compel Apple to let users access third-party app stores and permit app sideloading on iPhones and iPads, among other sweeping changes designed to make the digital sector fairer and more competitive.\nUnder the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the rules will apply to tech giants that meet its \"gatekeeper\" criteria and force them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers.\nApple is almost certain to be classified as a \"gatekeeper\" due to the size of its annual turnover in the EU, its ownership and operation of platforms with a large number of active users, and its \"entrenched and durable position\" due to how long it has met these criteria, and will therefore be subject to the rules set out in the DMA.\nThe DMA could force Apple to make major changes to the way the App Store, Messages, FaceTime, and Siri work in Europe. For example, it could be forced to allow users to install third-party app stores and sideload apps, give developers the ability to closely interoperate with Apple's own services and promote their offers outside the \u200c\u200cApp Store\u200c\u200c and use third-party payment systems, and access data gathered by Apple.\nOne of the more recent additions to the DMA is the requirement to make messaging, voice-calling, and video-calling services interoperable. The interoperability rules theoretically mean that Meta apps like WhatsApp or Messenger could request to interoperate with Apple's iMessage framework, and Apple would be forced to comply within the EU.\nThe DMA was proposed by the European Commission in December 2020 and agreed by the European Parliament and the Council in record-time, in March 2022. It now moves into a six-month implementation phase and will start to apply on May 2, 2023. After that, within two months and at the latest by July 3, 2023, potential gatekeepers will have to inform the Commission of their core platform services if they meet the thresholds established by the DMA.\n\"The DMA will change the digital landscape profoundly,\" said executive vice-president Margrethe Vestager in a statement accompanying a Commission press release. \"With it, the EU is taking a pro-active approach to ensuring fair, transparent and contestable digital markets. A small number of large companies hold significant market power in their hands. Gatekeepers enjoying an entrenched position in digital markets will have to show that they are competing fairly. We invite all potential gatekeepers, their competitors or consumer organizations, to come and talk to us about how to best implement the DMA.\"\nOnce the Commission has received the complete information, it will have 45 working days to make an assessment as to whether the company in question meets the thresholds and to designate them as gatekeepers. Following their designation, gatekeepers will have six months to comply with the requirements in the DMA, at the latest by March 6, 2024.\nIf (or more likely, when) Apple is designated a gatekeeper, it will have to make major changes to its \u200ciPhone\u200c and \u200ciPad\u200c platforms to accommodate the requirements. In March, before the law was passed, Apple said it was \"concerned that some provisions of the DMA will create unnecessary privacy and security vulnerabilities for our users.\"\nApple is also facing similar legislation in the United States, with U.S. House lawmakers in June introducing antitrust bills that would result in major changes to the tech industry if passed.",

        "title": "Apple sued for tracking users' activity even when turned off in settings",
        "body": "Over the past couple of years, Apple has centered its focus on user privacy. The iPhone maker has sparred with other Big Tech companies, most notably Facebook-owner Meta, about the issue. Apple's efforts to protect users' data has cost platforms like Facebook billions of dollars in revenue.\nBut, as it turns out, Apple has been collecting user data itself, even if their customers had explicitly changed their settings to stop the company from doing so. Now, Apple is being sued.\nApp developers and security researchers Tommy Mysk and Talal Haj Bakry from the software company Mysk recently found that iOS sends \"every tap you make\" to Apple from inside one of the company's own apps. According to the developers, attempts to turn this data collection off, such as selecting the Settings option \"disable the sharing of Device Analytics altogether\" did not affect the data from being sent.\nGet Mashable Deals delivered to your inbox daily Be the first to know about price drops on Apple products. Loading... Subscribe By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy Thanks for signing up!\nThe data being collected is quite detailed, too. As Gizmodo points out, a user looking at the App Store app on their iPhone would have their search data, what they tapped on, and how long they were checking out an app all sent to Apple in real-time. Using Apple's Stocks app? Apple will receive a list of the user's watched stocks, any articles they read in-app, and the names of any stocks they searched for. The timestamps for which a user viewed stock information will be sent over too. Some of Apple's apps even collect detailed information about the user's iPhone such as the model, screen resolution, and keyboard language.\nMysk conducted the test using a jailbroken iPhone running iOS 14.6. The team discovered similar iPhone activity with a non-jailbroken phone running iOS 16. However, due to encryption, Mysk could not determine exactly what data was being sent on the device using the latest operating system.\nA class action lawsuit was filed on Thursday claiming that Apple's actions violate the California Invasion of Privacy Act. The lawsuit doesn't focus so much on the fact that Apple is collecting this data. The suit hones in on Apple's settings, such as \"Allow Apps to Request to Track\" and \"Share Analytics,\" that give users the perception that they can disable such tracking.\nIt shouldn't be too surprising that Apple, or any tech company, collects user data. However, as the team at Mysk discovered, Apple is collecting this data regardless of a user's settings where they are given the option to turn data collection off, possibly giving them a false sense of privacy.",

        "title": "Report Reveals Apple Employees Internally Unhappy With Plans to Show More Ads to iPhone Users",
        "body": "A new report has revealed internal disagreement within Apple, causing some employees who work on the company's ads business to raise concerns that showing more ads to iPhone users ruins the premium experience that's been long offered to its customers, The Information reports.\nThe lengthy report by The Information takes a deep dive into how Apple's ads team operates and internal concerns that the company's already growing ads business is going too far. According to the report, for example, Apple's ads salespeople are forbidden from using specific keywords when talking about the company's ads business. Salespeople should use \"audience refinement\" instead of saying \"targeting,\" \"platform\" instead of \"algorithm,\" and \"competitor keywords\" and \"brand defenses\" instead of \"conquesting.\"\nAn Apple spokesperson, responding to the list of forbidden words, told The Information that the company wants employees to use language that is appropriate to Apple's offerings and that terms such as \"targeting\" do not apply since Apple doesn't let advertisers target specific users. Apple does not allow advertisers to target a demographic of less than 5,000 users to safeguard user privacy, according to the company.\nWhile publicly, Apple displays a unified front on ads, especially those in the App Store meant to help developers gain more users and customers discover more apps, internally, employees are less than satisfied with the current approach. In internal chatrooms, at least seven employees who worked on Apple's ads team voiced concerns that the company is going too far in its ads business and will damage the premium experience of using an \u200ciPhone\u200c. The report reveals that in 2018, Apple had plans to show users ads in Spotlight search on iOS, but it was reportedly abandoned after possible internal backlash.\nSome managers within Apple's ads department previously pushed salespeople to pitch ad opportunities to different companies using keywords that were less relevant to their apps but that were less expensive than other keywords, according to the report. The requests from managers often made salespeople uncomfortable, adding to the fact that Apple's ads team did not have access to contact information or financial details about developers on the \u200cApp Store\u200c, alienating them further.\nIn the last few weeks, developers, customers, and critics of Apple have all voiced disapproval of the company's plans to expand its ads footprint in the App Store. Reports also suggest Apple plans to introduce ads in Apple Maps and Apple TV+. Even with the expansion in ads, Apple has no ambition to grow its ads business to the size of Meta or Google, according to a person familiar with the matter cited by the report.\nBut inside Apple there doesn't currently seem to be much appetite for goals that big. One person familiar with Apple's ad business said the company doesn\u2019t harbor ambitions to compete at the same level as Meta and Google in digital advertising, nor does it plan to build an advertising network similar to those of its rivals that would serve ads to users outside its own apps and services. The person said ad executives are pleased with revenue growth based on Apple's existing ad spots and don\u2019t plan to significantly increase the number of ads on iPhones to meet growth targets.\nIn the meantime, Apple has paused ads on the App Store for specific categories after a botched roll-out last month, and the company has not formalized plans to expand ads into other services. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple's advertising chief Todd Teresi wants to more than double Apple's current revenue from its ads business to $10 billion annually, up from the current $4 billion.",

        "title": "Study: AirPods Pro are this close to being full-fledged hearing aids",
        "body": "A study in the journal iScience suggests that, in some noise situations, AirPods, particularly the Pro model, can work just as well as far pricier prescription-only models.\nAirPods are not sold or approved by the Food and Drug Administration as devices for those with mild to moderate hearing loss. But with cheaper, over-the-counter hearing aids now available at common retailers, there's a renewed interest in non-medical companies moving into the space to help people who don't need expert care\u2014including from Apple itself.\nResearchers from the Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan's National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, and other entities conducted what they believe is the first comparison of smartphone-oriented earphones with medically prescribed hearing aids. The study had a very small sample size of 21 people between 26 and 60 years old and was conducted in a lab setting with a single source of sound. Still, the results are intriguing, especially considering how many people already have access to iPhones, AirPods, and their audio-enhancing features.\nThe researchers tested AirPods with their Live Listen feature activated against five standards for a personal sound amplification product (PSAP) under ANSI CTA 2051-2017:\nFrequency response smoothness\nFrequency response bandwidth (range)\nMaximum output sound pressure level (OSPL) at 90 decibels input\nTotal harmonic distortion (THD)\nEquivalent input (or internal) noise level (EIN)\nAdvertisement\nAirPods 2 only met two of the standards, bandwidth and THD, while AirPods Pro met all of them except EIN, registering 37 decibel sound pressure levels (dB SPL), when the standard calls for 32 or less. A study co-author told The Wall Street Journal that passing the EIN threshold could make it harder for people to distinguish softer sounds and speech.\nThe AirPods were tested against a $1,500 Bernafon MD1 and a $10,000 OTICON Opn 1. In quiet settings, AirPods Pro helped people hear as well as the Bernafon and nearly as well as the OTICON. The AirPods 2 performed the worst but still helped people hear a human voice better than without using any device.\nIn a noisier environment, AirPods Pro's active noise cancellation brought their performance within range of the OTICON device, but only if the noises came from the sides (as you might expect for earbuds). Neither AirPod performed very well when noise came from the front while trying to listen elsewhere.\nNot noted in the report are a couple of distinctions between AirPods and more typical hearing aids. One is battery life, as the Bluetooth-based AirPods use an iPhone connection to hear environmental sounds and prioritize size over longevity. Another is repairability, another low or non-existent priority for the AirPods line.\nApple has long welcomed hearing aids to pair with iPhones, giving them a range of features and controls in its Made for iPhone (MFi) program. It has also pushed the hearing assistance features of its own audio hardware with Live Listen and Conversation Boost (which, pertinent to the study, improves mic pickup from people in front of you). A Wall Street Journal report from 2021 suggested Apple was considering positioning AirPods as hearing devices, something that's more feasible with the recent over-the-counter change to hearing aid regulations.\nArs Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs.",

        "body": "November 10, 2022\nUPDATE\nEmergency SOS via satellite on iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro lineups made possible by $450 million Apple investment in US infrastructure\nSatellite network and ground stations power the new service launching later this month\nA $450 million investment from Apple\u2019s Advanced Manufacturing Fund provides the critical infrastructure that supports Emergency SOS via satellite for iPhone 14 models. Available to customers in the US and Canada beginning later this month, the new service will allow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro models to connect directly to a satellite, enabling messaging with emergency services when outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage.\nA majority of the funding goes to Globalstar, a global satellite service headquartered in Covington, Louisiana, with facilities across the US. Apple\u2019s investment provides critical enhancements to Globalstar\u2019s satellite network and ground stations, ensuring iPhone 14 users are able to connect to emergency services when off the grid. At Globalstar, more than 300 employees support the new service.\n\u201cEmergency SOS via satellite is a perfect example of how American ingenuity and technology can save lives,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cWe are proud this service is enabled by leading US companies, and that our users can explore off-the-grid areas knowing they are still within reach of emergency services if they are in need.\u201d\nEmergency SOS via satellite is just one of the groundbreaking safety capabilities the iPhone 14 lineup provides. Crash Detection can now detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services when a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone.\nDelivered in partnership with Globalstar, Apple\u2019s Emergency SOS via satellite service utilizes the spectrum in L and S bands specially designated for mobile satellite services by ITU Radio Regulations. When an iPhone user makes an Emergency SOS via satellite request, the message is received by one of Globalstar\u2019s 24 satellites in low-earth orbit traveling at speeds of approximately 16,000 mph. The satellite then sends the message down to custom ground stations located at key points all over the world.\nOnce received by a ground station, the message is routed to emergency services that can dispatch help, or a relay center with Apple-trained emergency specialists if local emergency services cannot receive text messages.\n\u201cThe launch of Emergency SOS via satellite direct to iPhone is a generational advancement in satellite communications, and we are proud that Globalstar\u2019s satellites and spectrum assets will play a central role in saving lives,\u201d said Jay Monroe, Globalstar\u2019s executive chairman. \u201cWith Apple\u2019s infrastructure investment, we\u2019ve grown our teams in California and elsewhere to construct, expand, and upgrade our ground stations, and we look forward to the next chapter in Globalstar\u2019s lifesaving technology.\u201d\nThe ground stations use new high-power antennas designed and manufactured specifically for Apple by Cobham Satcom in Concord, California. Cobham\u2019s employees engineer and manufacture the high-powered antennas, which will receive signals transmitted by the satellite constellation. Along with communicating via text with emergency services, iPhone users can launch their Find My app and share their location via satellite when there is no cellular and Wi-Fi connection, providing a sense of security when off the typical communications grid.\nTo increase reliability and coverage, these new antennas were installed in all Globalstar worldwide ground stations, including new ground stations in Nevada and Hawaii, as well as existing facilities in Texas, Alaska, Florida, and Puerto Rico. Several antennas at each ground station communicate with the satellites and relay the information provided by the user so they can get the help they need.\nTo connect iPhone with the satellite network, users communicate over the mobile satellite services spectrum, which Globalstar has operated in the US for the past 20 years. With upgraded ground stations, and soon an updated satellite constellation, Apple and Globalstar will ensure the spectrum continues to enable emergency services.\nIn addition to the groundbreaking safety features, the iPhone 14 lineup features advanced camera systems, all-day battery life, and industry-leading durability features. Customers looking to upgrade to the iPhone 14 lineup can save up to $1,000 with trade-in \u2014 either online at apple.com or at an Apple Store \u2014 when they activate their device with select US carriers.\nIn 2021, Apple announced an acceleration in its US investments, with plans to make new contributions of more than $430 billion over a five-year period.\nPress Contacts\nApple Media Helpline\nmedia.help@apple.com",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nApple's search ads on an iPhone 11 Pro\nApple has big plans to expand its home-grown advertising business. However, it could be a struggle both in dealing with a privacy-focused public image and from its own engineers.\nWhile small compared to behemoths such as Google's advertising empire, Apple's own advertising isn't a small project for the company, with it earning billions from ads served in the App Store and other areas.\nHowever, while Apple has ambitions to grow its ad business in the coming years, potentially hitting $6 billion by 2025, it has to also deal with a fundamental struggle. Advertising is viewed as an anti-privacy industry, whereas Apple is decidedly on the side of privacy being a human right.\nThis is not just an external image struggle, but one that's also internal. Engineers working on Apple's ad technology have signaled that, though Apple wants to get its ad sales bigger, the engineers don't want it to swell too big.\nAt least seven people who work with or on the ad team told The Information of apathy among Apple's employees over the ad business. Two said that some engineers took to internal chatrooms over it, expressing fears Apple could be going too far and potentially harming the iPhone's premium experience.\nExternally, after years of proclaiming to consumers that it cares about privacy and railing against firms that rely on advertising for revenue, Apple is also seeing critics argue that the ad business isn't going right at all for the company.\n\"They can't alienate users by essentially taking advantage of everything they have built their brand on such as privacy, protecting your data and protecting your identity,\" said market research firm Insider Intelligence's director of forecasting Peter Newman.\nApple has also come under fire for displaying gambling app ads next to kids applications and gambling addiction recovery apps in the App Store.\nShac Ron, a former Apple engineer, tweeted they were \"glad to see Apple getting raked for ads in the OS.\" Describing the effort as \"disgusting and shameful,\" Ron added \"I hope they will realize how offensive these are but realistically I doubt it.\"\nBoosts from initiatives such as App Tracking Transparency has some analysts claiming Apple's ad business could rake in $30 billion by 2026, in quite ambitious predictions.\nInternally, one person familiar with the ad business says Apple doesn't have the same ambitions for its ad arm as Meta or Google, and it doesn't plan to build a vast ad network beyond its ecosystem. Executives are allegedly pleased with revenue growth based on existing ad sports, and apparently don't plan to significantly increase the number of ad spots users could encounter on devices.\nThe focus on privacy for the company does add some limitations to the effort though. The ad products team is effectively isolated from other departments, so the ad team cannot get developer details from other teams, information that is more easily shared internally in organizations like Google.\nThe ad salespeople are also sometimes asked to do \"uncomfortable\" things, the report sources claim, such as being encouraged to pitch to clients to bid for keywords that were less relevant to their apps but were inexpensive due to there being few other bidders. Salespeople claim managers said the aim was to increase prices for those inexpensive keywords, which helped the team reach end-of-quarter revenue targets.\nAn Apple spokesperson told the report that no recommendations to developers comes at their expense, that developers have control over what they bid on, and that developers only pay per tap or installation, rather than impressions.",

        "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook holds the new iPhone 14 at an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, September 7, 2022.\nApple will buy some of its chips from a factory in Arizona, Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month at an internal company meeting in Germany, according to Bloomberg News.\nApple currently sources all of its processors from factories in Taiwan. It designs its own chips and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company manufactures the A-series and M-series processors that power iPhones and Mac computers.\nIf Apple were to buy processors manufactured in the U.S., it would represent a significant diversification in Apple's supply chain away from Taiwan.\n\"We've already made a decision to be buying out of a plant in Arizona, and this plant in Arizona starts up in '24, so we've got about two years ahead of us on that one, maybe a little less,\" Cook said, according to Bloomberg.\nTSMC previously announced plans for a single factory in Arizona to open in 2024 focusing on chips that use the latest manufacturing technology. TSMC said earlier this month that it is planning a second chip factory in Arizona because of \"strong customer demand.\"\nIntel also operates chip foundries in Arizona and has said it wants to win Apple's business for its new foundry division that manufactures other companies' chips. It's also planning to build additional fabs in Ohio.\nU.S. politicians have worried that having companies like Apple source advanced and expensive parts from Taiwan could present risk and create chaos if China ever invaded the island nation. Cook reportedly said during the meeting that 60% of the world's processors come out of Taiwan.\nApple does the vast majority of its final assembly for iPhones and other devices on China's mainland, but it sources parts from many different countries, including the U.S. and Taiwan. Cook reportedly said that Apple was considering buying chips from factories in Europe, too.\nCongress passed the CHIPS Act earlier this year, which includes about $50 billion in financial incentives to semiconductor companies for building factories on U.S. soil.\nAn Apple representative declined to comment.",

        "title": "Ryujinx, a Nintendo Switch emulator, gets ported to macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel Macs)",
        "body": "Let's cut to the chase: macOS and Apple Silicon support (including older Intel Macs, although your mileage may vary)! Even with all the hurdles, roadblocks and brick walls put in our way, we're finally back on Mac! And back in style!\nWith the launch of a new entry in the vast Pok\u00e9mon library and an already brimming catalog of nearly 4000 incredible Switch titles, we hope you're as excited for this release as we are. Today, Ryujinx claims ANOTHER groundbreaking advancement to Switch emulation, tapping the unique potential of Apple Silicon to deliver the first & only macOS-compatible Switch emulator. The potential for Apple Silicon Macs is unparalleled in the current market. These devices could enable emulation that is closer to a native port than most gaming PCs, thanks to the powerful ARM synergy they share with the Switch.\nWe're committed to writing an accurate , stable and performant Nintendo Switch emulator with no hacks or shortcuts. If you wish to support us in delivering our goals across Windows, Linux and now macOS too, then consider backing us on Patreon and letting us know how everything is going over on Discord.\nThis release also includes LDN functionality - the ability to play with other Ryujinx, and CFW Switch users, via our hosted servers, LAN or ldn_mitm. You can read more about the features of LDN3 in this separate post!\nJust want the download? Head over to our website.\nGive the install guide below a read first though!\nInstall Guide\nThis will be split into two sections: macOS 12 'Monterey', macOS 13 ' Ventura' and above (if you're reading this in the future).\nmacOS 13 'Ventura'\nExtract the downloaded zip package from the download page somewhere safe. We recommend against any folders that may be protected or otherwise cause permission issues, such as directly on the desktop or at the root of any drive.\nWhen you try to run the 'Ryujinx' executable you will be met with this pop-up, as the build is not officially signed.\nWe promise we aren't malicious software.\nAt this point you'll need to go to Settings and then navigate to Privacy & Security.\nScroll down to the Allow applications downloaded from options and you will find a box informing you that Ryujinx was blocked; select Open Anyway. A pop-up will ask you to confirm this choice.\nThis is a one-time process. Subsequent boots will not need to authorise Ryujinx. We are looking into official signing of macOS releases in the future!\nmacOS 12 'Monterey'\nExactly the same process as above but your settings window will look a bit different!\nAttempt to boot Ryujinx, then navigate to Security & Privacy.\nSelect the Open Anyway option near the bottom of the page, a pop-up will ask you to confirm this choice.\nAlright, if any of you are interested in the nerd stuff, how we got it to work and what challenges still remain then the bulk of this post remains. Even if you're the kind of person to never read the manual, we'd suggest reading this anyway. Having a base understanding of what's happening, the current strengths and limitations, and future work will help enormously if and when you have questions.\nNew SoC, who dis?\nCredit: TechRadar\nWhen we last supported macOS, Apple was booorriinnggg. They used the same architectures and hardware as regular desktops and laptops, but with worse software support. However, since the shift to their own 'Apple Silicon' SoCs (System on a Chip), many consumers, and more importantly, developers have been foaming at the mouth to see what they're capable of. For Switch Emulation it's a bit of a double kill with the increased performance of Apple Silicon combined with the 1:1 ARMv8 CPU architecture of the Switch's Tegra X1.\nImplementing ARM compatibility is a big-deal for normal software, and emulators are far from normal. But, as we alluded to earlier, one of the niceties for Switch Emulation in particular is that the host and guest system both execute the same code. Dedicated optimizations for Apple Silicon have thus been made:\nARM Hypervisor - Allows native ARMv8 code execution with no translation. The overhead cost of emulating the game code is almost entirely removed, accessing the full potential of the chip.\nThe overhead cost of emulating the game code is almost entirely removed, accessing the full potential of the chip. ARM64 JIT - ARM support has been added to our CPU JIT recompiler 'ARMeilleure' for cases where the above hypervisor won't work, such as 32-bit titles like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. This has been optimised to allow a much more direct mapping for floating point instructions and behaviours compared to x86. Because of this, there is a lot more potential for JIT performance than regular x86 CPUs.\nFor the rare titles that don't work using the Hypervisor, a manual option to use the JIT has been made available. Beware, while this may increase compatibility, performance and stability will be severely impacted.\nWhile the ARM CPU cores on Apple Silicon are mighty impressive, not everything is as rosy on the GPU side...\nA trip down memory lane...\nFor those unaware, Ryujinx did initially support macOS all those years ago, before our OpenGL version-needs exceeded what Apple was prepared to provide. Apple have since fully deprecated OpenGL on macOS and support only very old versions for legacy purposes, thus forcing our exodus. While Apple do develop and maintain their own proprietary graphics API 'Metal', many had hoped that the new kid on the block, Vulkan, would eventually be on the agenda for Apple going forward. Unfortunately, here we are in 2022 with no sign that anything other than Metal is a priority or even a goal on Apple's roadmap.\nMany other emulators such as RPCS3, PCSX2, and most notably Dolphin have all, over time, been able to implement graphical support for macOS via one of two routes: a Metal backend or MoltenVK. Some used both at one point or another.\nVulkan... Volcano... Molten. I see what you did there!\nMoltenVK is a library that translates between Vulkan and Metal, effectively meaning if you have a Vulkan backend you can make use of MoltenVK to translate those calls to Metal; thus acting as a pseudo-Metal backend. The issue is that those aforementioned emulators all mimic consoles with relatively old GPU architectures which, while complex in their own ways, do not particularly stress the limits of Metal, Vulkan, and by extension MoltenVK. By contrast, the Switch uses a relatively modern (architecturally-speaking) Nvidia GPU, with all the bells and whistles that follow along. To say that this stretches Metal would be an understatement. Fundamentally it's a brick wall.\nOr at least that's what we thought...\nFetching our Sledgehammers\nThis was not easy. Metal being feature-barren, and the new Mac GPUs being closer to mobile hardware than desktop has caused a whole world of hurt. Core extensions and features simply don't exist and paths that a desktop GPU would consider \"free\" are suddenly huge rendering costs, if they even have the ability to render at all. It's hard enough to make a Mac port of a video game that you yourself develop; it's even harder when you have no power over what the emulated game requests from your system.\nLuckily our GPU developers are experienced in the dark arts of getting stuff working on APIs and hardware which hate cooperating. Let's run through some of the core issues faced and how they're being overcome. This may be for the tech-wizards; but we'll try to make it digestible!\n4-byte Vertex Buffer Alignment Requirement: A very large number of games bind vertex buffers that just contain one attribute. When they do this, they tend to pack them tightly, which is allowed on normal graphics APIs. However, Metal demands that the stride aligns to 4 bytes, no matter what the size of the attribute is. To do this, we have a compute shader converting incompatible vertex buffers functioning alongside a cache, so the cost is only paid once. Most games would not work without this.\nA very large number of games bind vertex buffers that just contain one attribute.

To do this, we have a compute shader converting incompatible vertex buffers functioning alongside a cache, so the cost is only paid once. Most games would not work without this. Transform Feedback: Transform Feedback is another feature that doesn't exist on Mac, but is used by a few choice games like Xenoblade and Legends Arceus. We have a rather ingenious (but complicated) solution to this - just write the transform feedback outputs to storage buffers at the end of the vertex stage. The result is just as fast and works properly across affected titles.\nTransform Feedback: Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus\n16 Samplers: This issue is a bit of a killer, since more complicated Switch games bind a lot more textures and samplers than this. Thankfully, this limitation can be avoided through Metal Argument Buffers, which MoltenVK has an option to use. This has proven to be a bit buggy and slower in general, but significantly more games work thanks to it.\nThis issue is a bit of a killer, since more complicated Switch games bind a lot more textures and samplers than this.

This has proven to be a bit buggy and slower in general, but significantly more games work thanks to it. Triangle Fan: A rather niche topology that draws triangles around a starting point, occasionally used to draw quads and circles in user interfaces. We support this by using the same compute shader conversion path as we do with vertex buffers, but converting an index buffer to the target topology instead. This has actually already been added to mainline, in the form of quads to tris conversion, which ended up faster there too.\nA rather niche topology that draws triangles around a starting point, occasionally used to draw quads and circles in user interfaces.

A rather ingenious solution, if you ask us.\nWe just pretend this doesn't exist for now. A rather ingenious solution, if you ask us. Geometry Shaders: Geometry shaders do not exist in Metal or MoltenVK. Used for writing 3D textures in UE4 games, and a number of complex graphical effects in others, missing this would definitely hurt compatibility. However, gdkchan has come up with a clever method to emulate these stages using additional draws to vertex shader only. The result is incredibly impressive - hardware-accelerated geometry shaders on a GPU that doesn't support them. Coup de gr\u00e2ce!\nGeometry Shaders: Yoshis Crafted World\nAlas, we're not all-powerful deities nor wizards with magic wands. There are some things that we simply can't work around, most of them being architectural. As we mentioned before, the GPUs in Apple Silicon Macs are fundamentally different to typical desktop/laptop GPUs. These GPUs are more similar to mobile hardware where rendering is done in tile memory, which is copied to/from the unified memory when a render pass happens. This means that updates to buffers in the middle of a render pass are more costly than usual, as it can result in render targets being copied in and out of memory all the time. However, the macOS build includes many strategies that attempt to mitigate this almost entirely, and some of these changes have already started being upstreamed (with positive performance impacts on Windows/Linux!).\nAnd now, after we've spoken so much about the GPU, let's see it all come together and render something!\nMedia Gallery\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nFinally... a Nintendo 64 emulator on MacOS :D\nKnown issues\nRyujinx is an experimental emulator, and this is our first release on a completely different platform and architecture. Experimental-squared! As such, there will be issues.\nARM64 Hypervisor does not function in all titles, most notably The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Manually forcing the ARM64 JIT may allow these games to boot. Forcing Ryujinx to run via Rosetta could also be a potential option, although this is relatively uncharted territory as far as stability goes.\nShader stutter is amplified due to the translation required between Vulkan's SPIR-V and Metal's MSL shaders. While not as significant as OpenGL, it is noticeable.\nGeneral performance, stability and graphical issues will occur. We haven't tested every game under the sun but we're sure you guys will!\nClosing words\nAll in all, we're pleased with what we've managed to accomplish. A barrier that many, including ourselves, originally thought unbreakable has been cracked wide open, and the best part is: this is just the beginning. With not only our own efforts to improve the core emulation, but upcoming updates to Metal 3 and the constantly improving MoltenVK, the experience is only going to get better.\nTo wrap up, the download is here, our Discord is here, and if you wish to support us on Patreon you can find us here.",

        "title": "Huge Foxconn iPhone plant in China rocked by fresh worker unrest",
        "body": "Summary\nCompanies Online images show hundreds of workers protesting\nSurveillance cameras and windows smashed by men with sticks\nWorkers complain of delayed pay, insufficient food\nFoxconn says working to prevent repeat of violence\nSHANGHAI/TAIPEI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers joined protests at Foxconn's (2317.TW) flagship iPhone plant in China, with some men smashing surveillance cameras and windows, footage uploaded on social media showed.\nThe rare scenes of open dissent in China mark an escalation of unrest at the massive factory in Zhengzhou city that has come to symbolise a dangerous build-up in frustration with the country's ultra-severe COVID rules as well as inept handling of the situation by the world's largest contract manufacturer.\nThe trigger for the protests, which began early on Wednesday, appeared to be a plan to delay bonus payments, many of the demonstrators said on livestream feeds. The videos could not be immediately verified by Reuters.\n\"Give us our pay!\", chanted workers surrounded by people in full hazmat suits, some carrying batons, according to footage from one video. Other footage showed tear gas being deployed and workers taking down quarantine barriers. Some workers had complained they were forced to share dormitories with colleagues who had tested positive for COVID-19.\nFoxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said in a statement it had fulfilled its payment contracts and that reports of infected staff living on campus with new recruits were \"untrue.\"\n\"Regarding any violence, the company will continue to communicate with employees and the government to prevent similar incidents from happening again,\" the company added.\nA source familiar with the situation in Zhengzhou said production at the plant was unaffected by the worker unrest and output remained \"normal\".\nReuters earlier reported that iPhone output at factory could slump by as much as 30% in November, and that Foxconn aimed to resume full production there by the second half of the month. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) had warned it expects lower shipments of premium iPhone 14 models than previously anticipated.\nWhile the latest unrest has added \"uncertainties\" to the target, the source said the company was still working hard to reach it, adding that \"only a portion\" of the new recruits took part in the unrest.\nA second source familiar with the matter, however, said Foxconn was unlikely to hit the target, pointing to disruptions caused by the unrest, impacting particularly new recruits who were hired to bridge the gap in the workforce.\n\"Originally, we were trying to see if the new recruits could go online by the end of November. But with the unrest, it's certain that we can't resume normal production by the month-end.\"\nFoxconn accounts for 70% of iPhone shipments globally. It makes most of the phones at the Zhengzhou plant, though it has other smaller production sites in India and southern China.\nShares of Foxconn have slipped 2% since the unrest emerged in late October.\nThe disruptions may shift some iPhone sales into the March quarter from the key holiday quarter, D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Forte said.\n[1/3]A group of people cross a downed fence following a protest at Foxconn's plant in Zhengzhou, China in this screen grab obtained from a video released November 23, 2022. Video obtained by Reuters/via REUTERS\nWedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said he expected the shutdowns to cost Apple about $1 billion a week in lost iPhone sales. In the holiday quarter last year, Apple reported iPhone sales worth nearly $6 billion per week.\nRECRUITMENT DRIVE\nDiscontent over strict quarantine rules, the company's inability to stamp out outbreaks and poor conditions including shortages of food had caused workers to flee the factory campus since the Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier imposed a so-called closed loop system at the world's biggest iPhone plant in late October.\nUnder closed-loop operations, staff live and work on site, isolated from the wider world.\nFormer workers estimate that thousands have fled the factory campus. Before the unrest, the Zhengzhou plant employed some 200,000 people. To retain staff and lure more workers Foxconn has had to offer bonuses and higher salaries.\nLocal authorities also stepped in to help, with some urging retired soldiers and government workers to take on stints, according to local media reports.\nThe first source said that the eagerness of local authorities to recruit workers may have played a role in causing \"miscommunication\" with the new hires on issues including allowance and accommodation.\nThe Zhengzhou government did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.\nWORKER WOES\nIn the videos, workers vented about how they were never sure if they would get meals while in quarantine or over inadequate curbs to contain an outbreak.\n\"Foxconn never treats humans as humans,\" said one person.\nApple did not respond to requests for comment.\n\"It's now evident that closed-loop production in Foxconn only helps in preventing COVID from spreading to the city, but does nothing (if not make it even worse) for the workers in the factory,\" Aiden Chau of China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based advocacy group, said in an email.\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, most of the footage on Kuaishou, a social media platform where Reuters reviewed many of the videos, had been taken down. Kuaishou did not respond to a request for comment.\nReporting by Brenda Goh and Beijing Newsroom; Additional reporting by David Kirton in Shenzhen, Yimou Lee in Taipei, Yew Lun Tian, Eva Mathews and Tiyashi Datta; Writing by Anne Marie Roantree; Editing by Edwina Gibbs, Louise Heavens, Bernadette Baum and Sandra Maler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "title": "Apple Reportedly Has 3000 People Working On Headset",
        "body": "Apple has around 3000 people working on its upcoming AR/VR headset, The Information reports.\nBut the report states Meta\u2019s Reality Labs division has \u201cmore than five times as many\u201d people working on Quest, AR glasses, and associated software. That apparently includes roughly 1100 working on Quest, 1900 on content, 2000 on AR, 1000 on machine learning, 1000 developing custom chips, and 2400 in the research team.\nAccording to recent public filings, Apple employed approximately 164,000 people in September of this year while Meta had 87,314. Each company is in a very different stage of build-out, with Apple operating globally including a large footprint of retails stores and already developing its own chips. Meta, meanwhile, just opened its first store as the company still partners with Qualcomm for chips in its headsets.\nLast year The Information, Bloomberg, and supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo released reports claiming Apple is preparing to release a premium headset for VR and AR with high resolution color passthrough. Kuo claimed this headset will weigh noticeably less than current VR headsets and feature high resolution OLED microdisplays, while The Information claims it will be powered by the M2 chip seen in the latest MacBooks. In August an Apple-linked company filed to trademark \u2018Reality One\u2019, \u2018Reality Pro\u2019, and \u2018Reality Processor\u2019, suggesting the headset and its processor will be branded Apple Reality.\nIn June Bloomberg reported Apple is working on realityOS (rOS) versions of its core apps as well as the ability to view a Mac\u2019s display, and AR/VR developer tools. References to realityOS were found in App Store upload logs and Apple code earlier this year, and an Apple-linked shell company trademarked RealityOS in May.\nIn October The Information reported the headset will feature leg tracking and iris scanning for logins and payments. And earlier this year it released an in-depth report on the project\u2019s troubled history. The headset apparently has 14 cameras in total when including those used for passthrough, positional tracking, eye tracking, face tracking, hand tracking, and body tracking \u2013 which reportedly caused \u201cheadaches\u201d for hardware and algorithm engineers. One reported feature of the headset is a screen on the front to let others in the room see your upper face and eyes. But adding this screen apparently made the development of its camera passthrough technology more difficult. Plans can change for hardware development sometimes even quite late into a product\u2019s planning, with Quest Pro for example ditching a depth sensor just months before release.\nThat report also claimed Apple \u201calmost never\u201d mentions games in internal presentations, and isn\u2019t developing a tracked controller, with the input methods instead being hand tracking and a \u201cclothespin-like finger clip\u201d which showed up in Apple patent filings.\nThe Information previously reported Apple is considering pricing the product as high as $3000, but says Apple was working to reduce the cost of materials to make it more affordable. If the reports so far are to be believed, though, Apple\u2019s product will have higher resolution, a more powerful processor, and a slimmer design than Quest Pro.\nMing-Chi Kuo predicts Apple will host a media event in January, deliver development kits 2-4 weeks later, and launch pre-orders in the second quarter of 2023 for a release before WWDC 2023. WWDC is Apple\u2019s yearly software conference, almost always held in June.",

        "body": "November 15, 2022\nPRESS RELEASE\nEmergency SOS via satellite available today on the iPhone 14 lineup in the US and Canada\niPhone 14 users can now connect with emergency services when cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available; the service extends to France, Germany, Ireland, and the UK in December\nCUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced its groundbreaking safety service Emergency SOS via satellite is now available to customers in the US and Canada. Available on all iPhone 14 models, the innovative technology enables users to message with emergency services while outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. Additionally, if users want to reassure friends and family of their whereabouts while traveling off the grid, they can now open the Find My app and share their location via satellite. Emergency SOS via satellite is available in the US and Canada starting today, November 15, and will come to France, Germany, Ireland, and the UK in December.\n\u201cSome of the most popular places to travel are off the beaten path and simply lack cellular coverage. With Emergency SOS via satellite, the iPhone 14 lineup provides an indispensable tool that can get users the help they need while they are off the grid,\u201d said Greg Joswiak, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. \u201cOur teams worked tirelessly to tackle a new set of technical challenges to bring this service to life, in addition to building a reliable on-the-ground infrastructure. Emergency SOS via satellite is a breakthrough service available only on the iPhone 14 lineup, and a new innovation that we hope will provide our customers some peace of mind.\u201d\nEvery model in the iPhone 14 lineup \u2014 iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max \u2014 can connect directly to a satellite through a combination of custom-designed components and deeply integrated software. Emergency SOS via satellite builds on existing features vital to iPhone users, including Emergency SOS, Medical ID, emergency contacts, and Find My location sharing, offering the ability to connect to a satellite for a more 360-degree approach to sharing critical information with emergency services, family, and friends. This game-changing service allows Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) \u2014 or emergency services call centers \u2014 to connect to even more users in emergency situations, and requires no additional software or protocols to enable communications. Users will be connected directly to emergency services that are equipped to receive text messages, or to relay centers with Apple-trained emergency specialists who are ready to contact PSAPs that cannot receive text messages on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\u201cProviding Emergency SOS via satellite is an important breakthrough that will save lives. The critical work being done by Apple to create innovative new solutions to support 911 providers and first responders is a huge step forward in protecting Californians and the broader public during an emergency situation,\u201d said Mark Ghilarducci, the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services\u2019 director.\nHow Emergency SOS via Satellite Works\niPhone can already quickly and easily call emergency services if a user is in need of help, even if they are unable to dial 911, with a long press on the power and volume buttons, or by rapidly pressing the power button five times. With Emergency SOS via satellite \u2014 introduced with the iPhone 14 lineup \u2014 if a user is not able to reach emergency services because no cellular or Wi-Fi coverage is available, an easy-to-use interface appears on iPhone to get the user help utilizing a satellite connection. A short questionnaire appears to help the user answer vital questions with a few simple taps, which is transmitted to dispatchers in the initial message, to ensure they are able to quickly understand a user\u2019s situation and location. Apple worked closely with experts to review standard questions and protocols to identify the most common reasons for calling emergency services.\nFollowing the questionnaire, the intuitive interface guides the user where to point their iPhone to connect and sends the initial message. This message includes the user\u2019s questionnaire responses; location, including altitude; iPhone battery level; and Medical ID, if enabled. The questionnaire and follow-up messages are relayed directly via satellite to dispatchers that accept text messages, or to relay centers staffed by Apple\u2011trained specialists who can call for help on the user\u2019s behalf. The transcript can also be shared with the user\u2019s emergency contacts to keep them informed.1\n\u201cWe dedicate our lives to helping people in need, but there are inevitably people who are not able to contact a dispatcher. Emergency SOS via satellite will allow us to help iPhone users in more remote areas who might not otherwise be able to reach us,\u201d said Jennifer Kirkland, ENP, the Grand Junction Regional Communication Center\u2019s 911 center manager. \u201cBecause this service requires no additional technology for PSAPs, and because Apple has implemented a relay center model that 911 operators are familiar with, we can expect a seamless rollout, both for the PSAPs that accept text messages, and for those that are still voice-only.\u201d\nSatellites move rapidly, have low bandwidth, and are located hundreds of miles away from Earth, so it can take a few minutes for even short messages to get through. Apple designed and built custom components and software that allow iPhone 14 to connect to a satellite\u2019s unique frequencies without a bulky antenna. A text compression algorithm was also developed to reduce the average size of messages by 3x, making the experience as fast as possible. With Emergency SOS via satellite, users can send and receive messages in as little as 15 seconds in clear conditions.2 Using the built-in Emergency SOS via satellite demo, users can test satellite connectivity on their iPhone by connecting to a real satellite in range without calling emergency services, allowing them to experience the process and familiarize themselves with the service.\n\u201cEmergency SOS via satellite will not only be useful for those who live in rural areas without cellular coverage, but also for those who find themselves in the path of a natural disaster that takes down mobile networks. It will allow members in impacted communities to connect with 911 and get help, and that\u2019s our mission,\u201d said Laurene Anderson, NENA: The 9-1-1 Association\u2019s president and Charlotte County, Florida\u2019s E911 manager. \u201cAwareness and training will be key to seamless adoption of this service. What Apple is doing to spread the word among dispatchers, and to let the community practice with a demo mode that does not contact 911, will help everyone know what to do when an emergency strikes.\u201d\nFor users who go off the grid but don\u2019t experience an emergency, this advanced technology also enables them to share their location via satellite with Find My. In the Find My app, users can open the Me tab, swipe up to see My Location via Satellite, and tap Send My Location. The satellite connection on the iPhone 14 lineup also works with other safety features available on iPhone and Apple Watch, including Crash Detection and Fall Detection.3\nAvailability\nEmergency SOS via satellite and Find My via satellite are available today in the US and Canada, and will be available in France, Germany, Ireland, and the UK in December. The service will be included for free for two years starting at the time of activation of a new iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max.4\nEmergency SOS via satellite and Find My via satellite require iOS 16.1.\nUp to 10 emergency contacts using iOS 16.1 and iMessage will see the user\u2019s location, type of emergency, and a live transcript of their conversation with emergency services. Emergency contacts who are not on iPhone, and iPhone users who aren\u2019t using iOS 16.1 or iMessage, will see the user\u2019s location and type of emergency. The user can opt to stop sharing their information with an emergency contact at any time. In order to reach the relay center or dispatcher closest to the user, location information will also be shared with Apple. Connection and response times vary based on location, site conditions, and other factors. See support.apple.com/kb/HT213426 for more information. Access to a satellite connection with Crash Detection and Fall Detection on Apple Watch requires a connected iPhone 14 model running iOS 16.1. Users who purchased an iPhone 14 model before the availability date of Emergency SOS via satellite will receive two years of the service free starting from the service availability date.\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple\u2019s five software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple\u2019s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.\nPress Contacts\nApple Media Helpline\nmedia.help@apple.com",

        "body": "Apple and Amazon worked together to raise the price of iPhones and iPads by eliminating third-party Amazon sellers who offered Apple products at a lower cost, according to a new antitrust lawsuit filed today in Washington.\nThe complaint, filed by Hagens Berman law firm, says that Apple and Amazon had an \"unlawful horizontal agreement\" that reduced the \"competitive threat posed by third-party merchants,\" a violation of federal antitrust laws. There were around 600 third-party sellers of Apple devices on Amazon Marketplace, which was whittled down to just seven.\nAmazon began eliminating third-party sellers after it signed a 2019 deal with Apple to limit the number of resellers on Amazon marketplace to 20 per country. In exchange, Apple provided Amazon with a discounted wholesale price for iPhones and iPads.\nBy restricting third-party sellers from offering Apple products, Amazon made itself the dominant seller of Apple products on Amazon Marketplace, which Amazon and Apple both \"stood to benefit from\" even though it \"would harm the public.\"\nThe lawsuit claims that prior to the agreement, third-party resellers were offering \"prices steeply discounted\" from those Apple wanted to have for its online storefront, which resulted in lower prices for consumers. There is no word on specific devices that went up in price due to the agreement, and no explanation of whether sellers were offering older devices or current products, nor if these were refurbished devices.\n\"When Apple and Amazon renewed their existing reseller agreement in 2019, the only losing party to their plan was consumers, who were blindsided by the price increases,\" Berman said. \"Where consumers used to be able to find discounted prices of upwards of 20% for iPhones and iPads for sale on Amazon Marketplace, now they get locked into Apple's premium pricing.\"\nHagens Berman is aiming for an injunction to prevent Amazon from blocking third-party Apple resellers and reimbursement for consumers who \"overpaid for iPhones and iPads.\"",

Apple is expected to announce its own AR/VR headset in the coming months, with the device likely available next year.\nApple has not yet responded to a request for comment from MarketWatch on its plans for AR glasses.\nThe global VR market was valued at $21.83 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15% between 2022 and 2030, according to data from Grand View Research.\nBut Paolo Pescatore, technology analyst at PP Foresight, told MarketWatch that the market for VR and AR is still nascent. \u201cIt still feels like a solution looking for a problem,\u201d he said via email. \u201cWhile there seem to be numerous use cases, adoption and awareness remain lackluster.\u201d\nOpinion: Apple, more than Meta, holds the key to unlocking a \u2018metaverse\u2019-type world of AR\nNonetheless, there is scope for a wearable device that would connect to an iPhone, potentially opening up a \u2018metaverse\u2019-style world of AR. In this way Apple, more than Meta Platforms Inc. META, -4.27% , could hold the key to unlocking the potential of augmented reality.\nA product geared toward smart glasses feels like a sensible approach and would also be consistent with Apple\u2019s focus on wearable devices linked to its core product, the iPhone, Pescatore said. \u201cFurthermore, this feels less intrusive and offers more scope for differentiation,\u201d he added. \u201cIt builds upon its growing developer community and media partners who are now starting to release features for smart glasses.\u201d\n\u201cThe company has placed strong focus on the iPhone as a gateway to the Apple universe,\u201d said Pescatore, noting that this might suggest it is behind the curve on new hardware. \u201cAll rivals have been seeking to differentiate with new product categories such as foldable devices, smart glasses, VR and more,\u201d he said.\nBut just as Apple technologies such as the iPad and Apple Watch have revolutionized their respective product categories, Pescatore is confident that Apple can do the same with AR glasses. \u201cUltimately, when the device launches, Apple will kickstart consumer demand for smart glasses and the AR landscape in general,\u201d he said. \u201cFor sure, a new device will provide much-needed excitement for the entire developer and creative communities.\u201d",

        "title": "Apple's Product Design Team Reportedly Focused More on Costs in Recent Years",
        "body": "Apple's efforts to replace its former design chief Jony Ive have been hindered by increased turnover within the company's product design team over the past few years, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. The report claims that Apple has lost the majority of senior designers who worked under Ive, with many of them jumping ship to his new design firm LoveFrom, which he started after leaving Apple in 2019.\nAt least 15 senior Apple designers have left the company since Ive moved to a part-time role in 2015, whereas turnover was rare between 2000 and 2015, according to the report. Only a \"small handful\" of senior designers from the Ive era are said to remain.\nLast month, Apple confirmed that its vice president of industrial design Evans Hankey plans to leave the company next year, although the report claims that she currently has no plans to join LoveFrom. Hankey has served as Apple's de-facto design chief since Ive's departure, reporting to Apple's operations chief Jeff Williams.\nEven before Ive left, the report claims that Apple's operations department had started to gain more influence over the design team, resulting in an increased \"focus on costs\" rather than \"purely on look and features.\"\n\"The strength of the team was that we were a nucleus bound together by the incredible environment that there was and the things we could do in a fairly unconventional way for a large company,\" a longtime Apple designer told Bloomberg, on condition of anonymity. \"It was a special team. It wasn't easy after Steve passed \u2014 things started to become a lot more complicated. There were more pressures and outside distractions.\"\nThe report goes on to examine potential successors to lead Apple's design team, ranging from veteran industrial designer Richard Howarth to software design chief Alan Dye to an outside hire. Apple said Hankey plans to stay on during the transition.\n\"Apple's design team brings together expert creatives from around the world and across many disciplines to imagine products that are undeniably Apple,\" an Apple spokesperson said last month, in response to Hankey's planned departure. \"The senior design team has strong leaders with decades of experience. Evans plans to stay on as we work through the transition, and we'd like to thank her for her leadership and contributions.\"",
