        "body": "US technology giant Apple has been ordered to pay up to \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back taxes to Ireland after a European probe.\nApple faces the record bill after the European Commission (EC) ruled that a special scheme to route profits through Ireland was illegal state aid.\nThe tech giant's tax arrangements enabled it to pay a tax rate of as little as 0.005% on its European profits in 2014, according to the probe.\nThat is just \u00a350 in taxes on every \u00a31m of profit.\n:: The Wider Impact Of Taking A Bite From Apple\nIreland's finance minister Michael Noonan said he disagreed \"profoundly\" with the decision and would seek Cabinet approval for an appeal.\nThe sum to be paid by Apple is 40 times bigger than any previous demand by the EC in such a case.\nIt could be reduced if other countries seek more taxes themselves from the US tech giant.\nCommissioner Margrethe Vestager said: \"Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies - this is illegal under EU state aid rules.\nAdvertisement\nImage: Starbucks has been ordered to pay \u00a326m in the Netherlands after a tax crackdown\n\"The Commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years.\"\nThe probe found that Apple's profits were routed via Ireland to virtual head offices that had no employees, no premises and carried out no real activities.\nThese profits were not subject to tax in any country under provisions of Irish law that are no longer in force.\nIt meant that one subsidiary, Apple Sales International, paid a tax rate of just 1% in 2003, declining to 0.005% by 2014.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:29 Apple's Tax Bill Over The Last Five Years\nApple chief executive Tim Cook said that the ruling would have a \"profound and harmful effect\" on investment and job creation in Europe and that the company paid all the taxes it owed in all the countries where it operated.\nChief financial officer Luca Maestri said the suggestion that Apple paid as little as \u00a350 for every \u00a31m in profit was \"a completely made-up number\".\nThe EC's tax crackdown on multinationals has prompted criticism in Washington, which accuses it of targeting US companies.\nOnline retailer Amazon and fast food giant McDonald's face probes over their tax arrangements in Luxembourg while coffee chain Starbucks has been ordered to pay up to \u20ac30m (\u00a326m) in the Netherlands.",

        "title": "T-Mobile shifting entirely to unlimited data in new bid to shake up industry",
        "body": "T-Mobile will shift to a single wireless plan offering unlimited data \u2014 a surprise move that the company\u2019s CEO, John Legere, says he doesn\u2019t believe rivals Verizon and AT&T will be able to match.\nLegere announced the new plan, \u201cT-Mobile One,\u201d in a video this morning. Under the new plan, the Bellevue, Wash.-based wireless company will charge $70/month for the first line, $50/month for the second, and $20/month for additional lines up to eight, if the customer has auto-pay enabled. That averages to $40/month for a family of four, the company notes.\nThe plan includes unlimited talk, texting and 4G LTE smartphone data.\n\u201cI declare that the era of the data plan is over,\u201d says Legere in the video announcing the \u201cUn-carrier 12\u201d initiative. \u201cWe are completely destroying the whole concept of a data plan, it\u2019s gone. We have one single offer that banishes data buckets forever.\u201d\nThe new T-Mobile One plan begins on Sept. 6. The company says existing T-Mobile customers will be able to stay with their current plans or shift to the new T-Mobile One unlimited plan.\nWhether the new initiative is a deal for T-Mobile\u2019s customers depends on how much data they use. Under the company\u2019s existing Simple Choice plan, which comes with data limits, a customer pays $95/month for the first line of unlimited data. A plan with 6GB of data costs $65/month, and one with 2GB of data costs $50/month.\nBy setting a higher entry-level price of $70/month, the new plan is a risk for T-Mobile. Financial analysts homed in on that risk in their questions for executives, asking if the move could reduce the company\u2019s additions of postpaid subscribers, who pay at the end of a billing period, have better credit than their prepaid peers, and are generally considered more valuable customers.\nHowever, T-Mobile executives said the majority of the company\u2019s postpaid customer base is on family plans, making the $40/month average for a four-line plan the more relevant cost.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not get too mathematical about it,\u201d said Mike Sievert, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, addressing questions on that topic during a conference call this morning with analysts and reporters. \u201cThis is the single most consistent thing our customers have ever asked for. Over 1 million times in social media, they\u2019ve said, \u2018Could you just set my data free?\u2019 \u201d\n[Related: Sprint CEO calls T-Mobile CEO a \u2018con artist,\u2019 accuses rival of copying new unlimited data plan]\nT-Mobile says in a news release, \u201cAs with T-Mobile Simple Choice, those using the most data, the highest 3% \u2013 currently people using more than 26 GB of high-speed data per month \u2013 may see their data traffic prioritized behind other users once they cross that threshold during their billing month. As a result, they may notice relatively slower speeds but only at specific times and places that may experience high network demand or congestion.\u201d\nThe new T-Mobile One plan will come with unlimited mobile hotspot data, letting subscribers use their phone to connect a computer or other device to the network, but at 2G speeds. Speaking on the conference call this morning, T-Mobile executives said a premium option will be available with a higher-speed hotspot. Update: T-Mobile says the premium hotspot option will cost $15/month extra for 5GB of high-speed data.\nWireless video will stream at 480p standard definition, and the company will charge a $25/month premium for an \u201cHD add-on\u201d providing higher-definition video streaming.\nSpurred by the arrival of Legere as CEO in 2012, T-Mobile\u2019s \u201cUn-carrier\u201d announcements over the past few years have helped the company add more than 1 million net customers for 13 straight quarters, or more than three years.\nThe company\u2019s past Un-carrier moves have included unbundling the cost of the phone from the wireless plan, paying customers\u2019 fees when they switch from another carrier, no-extra-charge roaming in Canada and Mexico, the ability to stream video and music without counting against data caps, the T-Mobile Tuesdays loyalty program, issuing company shares to subscribers, and other initiatives.",

        "body": "While Apple's iPad sales continue to decline overall, the tablet is surging in demand from an unlikely source. The New York Times reports that nearly half of all iPad sales are to corporations and governments, with high-end iPad sales to business customers particularly strong. \"Apple is stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers,\" says Forrester analyst Frank Gillet, in a statement to the Times.\nThe boost from businesses and governments would have seemed highly unlikely six years ago when the iPad was originally launched, but Apple has been keen to woo businesses over to its mobile tablet in recent years. Apple teamed up with IBM to launch a range of business-focused iOS apps back in December 2014, and the company has also been working with Cisco and SAP to ensure iPads work well in enterprises.\nApple even teamed up with Microsoft to make the iPad Pro a success. During the tablet's launch, Microsoft's Office chief, Kirk Koenigsbauer, jumped on stage to demonstrate Office for iPad Pro. Microsoft has consistently tweaked its Office software for the iPad Pro ever since to make it more powerful, and the productivity suite even features in Apple's latest iPad Pro commercial. Apple wants everyone to believe that the iPad Pro is a real computer capable of real work, and it's clear that businesses are adopting it that way for their mobile computing needs.\nApple's success in the enterprise is unusual\nApple's fresh success in the enterprise is unusual for the company. Microsoft has typically dominated desktop computing inside businesses, and Steve Jobs always focused Apple on building products that consumers would love. Jobs even called IBM's best customers an \"orifice,\" and famously gave IBM the finger in a classic photo during the \u201880s era when Apple competed aggressively with IBM. Apple even aired a commercial depicting IBM as Big Brother from the George Orwell novel.",

        "title": "Tim Cook completes 5 years at Apple as CEO",
        "body": "Today marks the fifth anniversary since Tim Cook was named Apple CEO on August 24, 2011, the same day that late co-founder Steve Jobs stepped down as chief executive for the final time and recommended the board of directors appoint Cook as his permanent successor.\nUpon reaching the five-year mark, Cook has today unlocked previously awarded stock bonuses currently worth over $100 million. The bonuses are tied to both his tenure and Apple's performance under his leadership, including its total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 index.\nCook's bonus includes 700,000 tenure-based restricted stock units that vested today as part of a larger compensation package of over 4.7 million shares awarded on August 24, 2011, in addition to his first of six annual installments of 280,000 tenure-based restricted stock units that vested today. The combined 980,000 shares are valued at nearly $106.7 million based on AAPL's closing price of $108.85 on Tuesday.\nCook's bonus could be even higher if Apple's total shareholder return is in the middle third or top third relative to other companies in the S&P 500 from August 25, 2013 through August 24, 2016. He will receive another 140,000 RSUs for middle third performance, or 280,000 RSUs for top third performance. AAPL has risen around 52% since August 25, 2013, while the S&P 500 has risen around 32% in the same time period, making at least a middle third finish a strong possibility.\nA restricted stock unit, or RSU, is a form of compensation valued in terms of company stock, but the stock is not issued at the time of the grant. Instead, the recipient gets shares of stock at a later date, generally only if they are still employed by the company. Cook personally requested that his award be modified to adhere to a more performance-based compensation system in 2013. Another 700,000 of his RSUs are scheduled to vest on August 24, 2021, plus 280,000 RSUs each August 24 through 2021.\nCook's net worth, assuming he remains with the company through August 24, 2021 and meets performance targets, is estimated to be over $500 million based on his current stock options and RSUs awarded. He has previously pledged to donate the vast majority of his wealth, including stock bonuses like these, to charities in his lifetime. In May 2015, for example, Cook donated approximately 50,000 shares of Apple stock, then worth approximately $6.5 million, to undisclosed charities.\nCook has overseen the launch of the Apple Watch, MacBook Pro with Retina display, ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook, iPad Pro, several iPhone and iPad models, Apple Maps, Apple Music, Apple Pay, Siri, and many other products and services since taking over the reigns in 2011. Apple became the world's most valuable company in 2012 under his leadership, and it continues to hold that title today. Apple stock has risen over 132% since Cook was appointed as CEO five years ago.\nUpdate: Cook has netted another 280,000 shares of Apple stock, as the company returned 61% during the past three years, placing it in the top-performing third of the S&P 500 index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The additional shares were valued at approximately $30 million based on AAPL's closing price of $108.03 on Wednesday.",

        "body": "Update: Best Buy looks to be sold out in most areas.\nApple Watch prices have been in a relative freefall in recent months with the oft-rumored upgrade expected in the coming weeks. However, we aren\u2019t expecting a sea change upgrade this time around. Three weeks ago, a KGI report noted that the new Apple Watch 2 upgrade would include GPS, better waterproofing and improved performance but retain the same design. Another report last week reaffirmed those claims.\nA launch alongside the iPhone 7 next month seems obvious. Apple, therefore, is likely in a hurry to clear current inventory (indeed shortages are already being seen) ahead of the launch and that takes the form of a $199 price tag on the base model Apple Watch Sport 38mm Space Gray Aluminum Case\u2026\nAs 9to5Toys notes, a new Apple Watch hit the $199.oo price point last night at Best Buy, marking a new milestone in the pricing. Apple and other retailers almost always price match (but it is easiest to get at online at Best Buy\u2019s ebay storefront) so effectively the price of the Apple Watch now starts at $199 at retail in the US. Open Box models start at $180 and there are a wide variety of options including 42mm models.\nThe price is $100 off of Apple\u2019s retail price which was reduced by $50 earlier this year from its original $349 base launch price.\nI would guess that even after the update, the original Apple Watch will still sell for around $200 so if you have been waiting on a $200 Apple Watch, I think it is still a safe time to buy. At $200, Apple Watch competes well with other fitness bands and you get so much more, especially with watchOS 3 waiting in the wings.\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for more hands-on videos and reviews",

Supplier is Toshiba??? pic.twitter.com/2r66q3nWRb \u2014 The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 24, 2016\nIt appears the 64GB option will also die and the 128GB option will become the mid-tier, while a new 256GB option will be made available for those who love to carry all the music and videos they\u2019ll ever need on the go.\nToshiba will supply some of those flash chips, according to the leak \u2014 though Apple could well be using other suppliers as well.\nThis news will be music to the ears of almost every iPhone fan \u2014 particularly those who can\u2019t spend the extra $100 on a mid-tier device. We\u2019ve been calling for the death of 16GB devices for years, and it looks like it\u2019s finally going to happen.\nThat\u2019s if this leak is genuine, of course.",

        "body": "A new set of leaked images shows the alleged \u2018iPhone 7 Plus\u2019 as you\u2019ve never seen before. Yes, that\u2019s correct as a Twitter user (@the_malignant) who has shared various similar leaks concerning the 2016 iPhone and other devices, and Chinese website iFeng, have posted new images on the web showing the device from various angles complete with comparisons with current iPhone models (via BGR).\nAs you can see above, the all new blue \u2018iPhone 7 Plus\u2019 looks pretty amazing, and has all the design markings we expect i.e. the single-band rear antenna lines and a protruding dual-lens camera are there. The shots below also clearly show the absence of the 3.5mm headphone jack, with the port being replaced by a speaker grille.\nWhat\u2019s even more interesting is the fact that the device is turned on, although Siri seems to have been replaced by Voice Control.\n\u201cThe device appears to be running a version of iOS 10, although the person who took the photos does not reveal any details about it. The phone likely comes from China considering that language seems to be set to Chinese, and has elements that iOS 10 beta testers will instantly recognize include the new widgets on the search screen, as well as a wallpaper that\u2019s included in Apple\u2019s list of default wallpapers for iOS 10\u201d.\nWhile there is no way to authenticate these images, they sure look pretty darn real.

        "body": "AT&T chairman Randall Stephenson will soon announce that a consortium of 33 companies, including Apple, AT&T, Google and Comcast are joining the FCC in an effort to crack down on phone call spam made by robots, according to Reuters. In the inaugural \u201cRobocall Strike Force\u201d meeting, the companies will announce their initial plans on how to stop US phone owners from receiving advertorial spam run by automated machines \u2026\nThe AT&T CEO said the 33 companies, which includes tech smartphone giants Apple and Google, will work on solutions to present a concrete plan by October 19 in a couple of months time.\nRight now, there are no details on what methods the companies have in mind to combat the spam phone calls, or what role Apple will play. There is a possibility Apple could add technology into iOS that can detect robotic spam callers before the user picks up the phone.\nAlthough a plan is to be expected by October 19, a prospective date for implementation of the scheme is even more fuzzy.\nAT&T chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson will make the announcement at the first \u201cRobocall Strike Force\u201d meeting at the FCC later on Friday, the company said. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler in July wrote major companies about robocalls. The strike force will report to the commission by Oct. 19 on \u201cconcrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,\u201d Stephenson said.\n\u201cAccelerate the development and adoption\u201d gives no promises about when such changes could come into effect, likely taking many months or years for 33 companies to coordinate with each other. At this stage, it\u2019s not even clear how the stakeholders would achieve such a feat: just like email spam, combatting phone spam is a cat and mouse game.\nIn iOS 10, Apple has already started along this path with a new extension point for third-party app developers that lets the phone flag up known marketers. At WWDC, Apple advertised this feature in the context of the Chinese region (where phone spam is also very high) but it works worldwide. This is what Craig Federighi is demoing at the keynote in the image above.\nPhone adds integration for third-party VoIP calls, voicemail transcription and a new caller ID extension for spam alerts.\nHowever, Apple has not announced any plans to provide this data itself as of yet. If customers want to take advantage of the new iOS 10 feature, they will have to download third-party apps that offer the underlying database and provide integration with the system. iOS 10 is expected to launch next month in September.\nWe\u2019ll bring more details to follow on Apple\u2019s telephone spam efforts as they are announced.",

        "body": "As Apple Pay continues to expand to more banks in the United States and around the world, it\u2019s slowly coming to more retail locations, as well. Next on the docket for Apple Pay support appears to be Chick-Fil-A, according to a tweet from the restaurant chain.\nLast year, it was reported that Apple Pay support was coming to Chick-Fil-A locations around the country, but the rollout never fully began, though a handful of users have been able to use the service sporadically. According to today\u2019s tweet, however, Apple Pay will be accepted at all Chick-Fil-A locations as of this Friday, August 19th. The mobile payment platform will be supported in-store and in the drive thru.\nChick-Fil-A\u2019s adoption of Apple Pay comes after the company has experimented with QR-based solutions in the past. Those solutions ultimately failed, according to employees, much like other QR-based offerings we\u2019ve seen. Chick-Fil-A has, however, supported Apple Pay in its recently revamped app on iOS.\nApple keeps a list of retailers that support Apple Pay on its website, though it has not yet been updated to acknowledge Chick-Fil-A\u2019s support. The fast-food chain is still listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d on Apple\u2019s website as of now. Other entities listed as coming soon including Forever 21, Johnny Rockets, T-Mobile, and L.L. Bean.\nSome retailers, however, continue to resist Apple Pay. Just last week, CVS announced their own \u201cCVS Pay\u201d QR code-based mobile payments solution. Walmart also resists Apple Pay, instead opting for its own QR solution, Walmart Pay.\nAs is usually the case with Apple Pay rollouts in national chains, some users have already reported being able to use the service at their local Chick-Fil-A. The full rollout, however, should be completed by this Friday, August 19th. Let us know in the comments of your experience using Apple Pay in Chick-Fil-A locations in the comments!\n@loneswords Yes, as of August 19th, Apple Pay and Android Pay are available for payment both in-restaurant and in the Drive Thru. \u2014 Chick-fil-A, Inc.

        "title": "New Report Confirms 'iPhone 7' and 'iPhone 7 Plus' Names, Effectively Ending 'iPhone 7 Pro' Rumors",
        "body": "The assumed names of this year's iPhone lineup -- \"iPhone 7\" and \"iPhone 7 Plus\" -- have been confirmed by \"reliable sources\" speaking with Japanese site Mac Otakara . The sources said that Apple is following this name scheme to avoid confusion of having back-to-back iPhones with \"S\" in the name, even though the iPhone 7 will largely be a minor update over the iPhone 6s.The new report nixes the chance for an additional third tier \"iPhone 7 Pro,\" which was a rumored dual-lens alternative to the single-lens \"iPhone 7 Plus\" early in the rumor cycle . The less-powerful camera option was said to be created by Apple as a fallback in case the dual-lens technology didn't pan out. Now that everything seems to be going well for the company in this area, and mockups have repeatedly shown a dual-lens camera enclosure, it makes sense for Apple to revert to the well-known \"Plus\" moniker for its next-generation 5.5-inch dual-lens iPhone, and drop any reference to \"Pro\" altogether.Otherwise,reiterates on the expected rumors of the iPhone 7: there won't be a 3.5 mm headphone jack, it will house an A10 chip, and it will introduce a new flush, capacitive Home Button in lieu of the traditional physical switch. That last aspect of the new iPhone has been a bit more up in the air in the weeks ahead of the September launch, since it's hard to fully decipher whether recent image mockups confirm one way or the other if the Home Button is pressure-sensitive or not.It's believed that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be revealed at an Apple event on September 7, with pre-orders beginning two days later on September 9. A recent leak from AT&T has pushed back the reported launch of the new iPhone, however, suggesting that Apple could be preparing a wide release on September 23 , although the original rumor of September 16 is also still a viable option.Article Link: New Report Confirms 'iPhone 7' and 'iPhone 7 Plus' Names, Effectively Ending 'iPhone 7 Pro' Rumors",

        "title": "Apple Drops 'Store' From Apple Store Branding",
        "body": "Apple appears to be making a slight branding change to its retail business, dropping the \"Store\" moniker when referring to its Apple Store locations. Apple has already made the change online, and all of its store pages now refer to stores by names like \"Apple Union Square\" or \"Apple Valley Fair\" or \"Apple The Grove,\" instead of \"Apple Store, Valley Fair\" or \"Apple Store, The Grove.\"\nIt's a change that appears to have started rolling out with the launch of the newer Apple Stores, like the Union Square location in San Francisco. Apple has always referred to that store as just Apple Union Square, and over the course of the last few days, the company has updated all of its retail store webpages to remove the \"Store\" branding. What was once \"Apple Store, Fifth Avenue,\" for example, is now just \"Apple Fifth Avenue.\"\nThe new website for The Grove Apple Store\nAn archived page for the Fifth Avenue Apple Store has the older branding as of August 12, suggesting this is a fairly recent change to Apple's retail plan.\nThe old website for The Grove Apple Store\nApple also recently sent out a memo to its retail employees, letting them know that the \"Store\" branding is gradually being dropped from both retail locations and online. While Apple told employees the change will be gradual and will start with new stores, pages for almost all stores have been updated to remove the \"Store\" titling.\nThe decision to remove the \"Store\" portion of Apple's line of retail locations likely has to do with efforts to turn newer stores into more than just simple stores, positioning them as gathering places for their communities. Apple Union Square, for example, features an outdoor plaza with regular acoustic performances and a 6K video wall with seating called \"The Forum,\" aimed at allowing artists, photographers, and musicians to inspire and educate customers through year-round programs, events, and classes.",

This is not the first time we are hearing about the possibility of a black color option, as well as other new finishes, like a midnight blue.\nThe black colour on the iPhone looks incredibly stylish, complete with little details like the shade of the antenna bands.

        "title": "The NSA hack proves Apple was right to fight the FBI",
        "body": "Tim Cook\nAfter the unprecedented breach of hacking tools and exploits stolen from the US National Security Agency's elite hacking unit, some privacy advocates see it as clear vindication of Apple in its fight with the FBI earlier this year.\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\"The component of the government that is supposed to be absolutely best at keeping secrets didn't manage to keep this secret effectively,\" Nate Cardozo, a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Business Insider.\nIn February, a judge ordered Apple to help the FBI unlock an iPhone that was used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of two attackers who killed 14 people in a December terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. That order set off a vigorous debate between law-enforcement officials seeking evidence and technologists worried over broader implications for personal privacy.\nWhile the company's legal team fought the order, Apple CEO Tim Cook published a letter arguing against being forced to build a so-called backdoor that would subvert the encryption that not only kept the shooter's phone secure, but also the smartphones of millions of other Apple users.\nMost in the technology community rallied around Apple at the time, arguing that weakened encryption might help government investigators, but it would also make customers vulnerable to hackers.\nNow, with a massive top-secret archive of some of the NSA's own exploits having been leaked online, it appears they were right.\nNSA headquarters\n\"The NSA's stance on vulnerabilities seems to be based on the premise that secrets will never get out. That no one will ever discover the same bug. That no one will ever use the same bug. That there will never be a leak,\" Cardozo said. \"We know for a fact, that at least in this case, that's not true.\"\nThe government eventually backed down from its fight with Apple in late March, after investigators said they were able to unlock the shooter's phone with the \"a assistance of a third party.\" It never disclosed who that was or how it broke into the phone.\nStory continues\nExactly how the FBI got into the phone is yet another case where the government is holding on to \"zero days,\" or software exploits that are completely unknown to companies and users. These exploits, when found, are typically disclosed to vendors so they can fix the problem, used by hackers to break into systems more easily, or sold on the black market.\nBut Cardozo believes the FBI's exploit of the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone 5C, its still unknown exploit of the Tor web browser in another case, and NSA's apparent hoarding of exploits that have now been made public, raises a larger issue around the legalities of government hacking.\n\"When the government finds, creates, or discovers a vulnerability in a system, there are essentially two things they can do: They can disclose it, or they can use it,\" he said. \"But the rules around that are completely broken.\"\nThere are some guidelines around how the government is supposed to deal with vulnerabilities in what is called the Vulnerabilities Equities Process, a framework that is supposed to outline how and when it would make sense to disclose a vulnerability to an affected company if the larger security risk is greater than the reward it could yield.\nBut the VEP is just nonbinding guidance created by the Obama administration \u2014 not an executive order or law \u2014 that has no legal standing.\n\"We need rules, and right now there aren't any,\" Cardozo said. \"Or at least none that work.\"\nNOW WATCH: There\u2019s a glaring security problem with those new credit card chips\nMore From Business Insider",

        "title": "Mossberg: The post-Jobs Apple has soared financially, but lacks a breakthrough product",
        "body": "Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Recode.\nFive years ago last week, the legendary Steve Jobs stepped down as Apple\u2019s CEO after an amazing 14-year run that took the technology company from the edge of disaster to the heights of glory. He personally selected his COO, Tim Cook, as the new CEO, and passed away six weeks later.\nSo, how has Apple changed in the first five years of the Tim Cook era? How is it different than at the peak of the Jobs era?\nThe short answer is that the company has surged financially to heights Jobs likely never dreamed of. It has also refined its popular product line and retained most of its senior talent.\nBut Cook\u2019s Apple has yet to produce the kind of new, game-changing product Jobs was famous for launching. Or, if it has, we don\u2019t know it yet.\nHowever, hard as it may be to believe, five years may be too short a time in which to judge the Cook era. But with a new iPhone launch expected next week, it\u2019s worth looking back on how the company has changed in the past five years.\nDollars and Sales\nAs a longtime product reviewer, I\u2019m less interested in any company\u2019s financials than I am in its products. But the financials can\u2019t be ignored. You\u2019ll find a very good summary giving a sense of Cook\u2019s reign in this five-chart post by Recode editor-in-chief Dan Frommer.\nthis summer Apple sold its billionth iPhone\nBut there are some notable highlights. Over his five-year tenure as CEO, Cook has roughly doubled Apple\u2019s revenues and profits to an astounding $234 billion and $53 billion, respectively. Recent quarters have shown a rare downward trend, but the five-year pattern is still impressive. And this summer Apple sold its billionth iPhone, less than a decade after its introduction. That\u2019s fewer units than all Android phones combined, but phenomenal for a single, premium product line. In just one quarter last December, iPhone sales exceeded the annual total for Jobs\u2019s entire last year in fiscal 2011. But, again, sales have recently been declining.\nEvolving products\nCook has evolved Apple\u2019s core products in ways we don\u2019t know whether Jobs would have done, with considerable success. In 2014, he launched two models of the iPhone 6, one of which matched the large screen size of Samsung\u2019s phones. It was well done, and sales soared. Last year slightly revised 6S models in the same sizes also sold well, but Apple followed up with an unconventional move in the iPhone SE, a reworking of the smaller iPhone 5S with modern internals that proved surprisingly popular.\nCook has evolved Apple\u2019s core products with considerable success\nCook also introduced a huge 13-inch iPad Pro, with a snap-on physical keyboard, which Jobs thought unnecessary, and a stylus, which Jobs mocked and hated, even scorning the idea during the original iPhone launch. This year, Cook followed up with a smaller iPad Pro. The iPad Pro is doing well in the enterprise market, but it doesn\u2019t appear to have yet reversed overall falling iPad sales.\nCook has also launched a beefed-up, app-based, Apple TV, which finds itself in a crowded, confusing market of set-top boxes and so-called smart TVs. But it\u2019s only a remnant of a major TV product, replete with a new programming service, that the company had long been hoping to provide. The new Apple TV is ambitious, but lags in sales behind Roku and Amazon devices, partly due to its high price of $149 for the base model, and $199 for a model with more memory.\nNew Products\nWhen Jobs was CEO, he dazzled the tech world by running the table with a string of new products that other companies scrambled to match: the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, the MacBook Air, and the iPad. That\u2019s a hard act to follow, and Apple has struggled to do so in the last five years.\nCook\u2019s biggest hardware bet, the Apple Watch, which began shipping last year, dominates the tiny global market for smartwatches, but has yet to become either the tech must-have or the popular fashion accessory it was meant to be. A new model may appear as soon as next week, with a completely revised user interface, which is in effect an admission that the initial interface wasn\u2019t good enough.\nMeanwhile, the Mac lineup has stagnated, with some models approaching years without an update. The only new Mac introduced recently is the MacBook, which offers a vision of the future, but is costly, slow, requires adapters to work with its forward-looking single USB-C port, and has an odd, flat keyboard I find uncomfortable. Updates to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro are reported to be in the works, however.\nthe Mac lineup has stagnated\nApple Pay, a contactless payment system for recent iPhones and the Apple Watch, is making steady progress, but it depends on external factors, like merchant acceptance.\nApple Music, the company\u2019s new streaming service based on its acquisition of Beats, is being overhauled in iOS 10 \u2014 at least in terms of its user interface \u2014 because it was lambasted for complexity and errors.\n3D Touch, a new navigation tool that detects pressure on the iPhone screen to perform quick actions and peer into items like emails without opening them, hasn\u2019t gained wide acceptance. It\u2019s in some apps, but it\u2019s still too hard to discover, missing on the iPads, and absent on Apple\u2019s surprisingly popular iPhone SE.\nMitigating Factors\nBut there are some major mitigating factors. First, the global economy is in the slowest economic recovery anyone can recall. Second, Cook is having to compete with a much more polished Android and a much more polished line of Samsung phones than Jobs ever did. The smartphone market in developed countries seems saturated. PC and tablet replacement cycles are longer.\nJobs\u2019 successes didn\u2019t happen overnight\nFinally, it\u2019s crucial to remember that Jobs\u2019 successes didn\u2019t happen overnight. While it was introduced in 2001, the iPod didn\u2019t really take off big time until 2004\u20132005. And it took a few years from its 2007 launch for the iPhone to begin hitting double digit quarterly unit sales. So the jury is out on the Apple Watch.\nExpanding Markets\nCook\u2019s real innovation may lie in his efforts to broaden the company\u2019s markets. He has worked tirelessly to grow Apple\u2019s presence in China, even in the face of some great native Chinese phones. And, in a move Jobs would likely have scorned, he has partnered with enterprise companies like IBM, Cisco, and Box to sell vastly more Apple devices into big companies by creating specialized apps and tools for them. This effort especially focuses on the iPad, whose consumer sales have been crumbling.\nBut, again, it\u2019s much too soon to know if these bets will be winners or losers in the long run.\nPrivacy and Security\nCook has shown a big commitment to both privacy and security by encrypting most iPhone data end-to-end and in a way that even Apple can't decrypt it. And he showed real guts earlier this year by refusing an FBI demand that he weaken that encryption to help the Bureau search a dead suspect\u2019s phone. He argued any software Apple built to do that would likely fall into the hands of bad actors and be sought by dictatorships worldwide.\nJobs was personally committed to privacy and security, and though we can\u2019t know if he would have put the company on the line in this fight, Cook was firm in protecting the values of the company.\nWhat\u2019s next\nWith iPhone and company sales falling in recent quarters, and likely to do so again, Apple needs the all-new product breakthrough that has eluded Cook \u2014 sooner rather than later. The company is seriously working on augmented reality, though I don\u2019t know details. Like everyone else, it\u2019s toiling away on artificial intelligence and machine learning, though it\u2019s focused more on building smarts into individual devices rather than in the cloud, like most of its competition. And it continues to work on automotive technology, though it isn\u2019t clear whether that means an entire car.\nRight now, Apple just needs an exciting new iPhone\nBut all of those potential payoffs are a way off. Right now, Apple just needs an exciting new iPhone. After I saw Samsung\u2019s gorgeous new Galaxy S7 in March, I wrote a column calling for the next iPhone to be \"spectacular.\" Based on rumors, that much oomph may not be in the offing until 2017.",

        "title": "MacBook Pro with new 'touchscreen strip' won't appear at September 7th iPhone event, says Bloomberg",
        "body": "Apple is preparing a big update to its MacBook Pro line of laptops. KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo first revealed that Apple is planning to replace the function keys on the MacBook Pro with an OLED touch bar, and now Bloomberg's Mark Gurman is confirming the initial reports. The new MacBook Pros are said to be slightly thinner than current models, with a slightly wider trackpad and an option for AMD Polaris graphics in at least one model.\nBloomberg says that Apple isn't planning to unveil the new MacBook Pros at an event on September 7th, where it's expected to launch a new iPhone and additional Apple Watch models. Apple is also expected to include USB Type-C on the new MacBook Pro, alongside a Touch ID fingerprint reader. \"Apple has tested versions of the upcoming laptops that integrate the scanner beside the new function key display,\" explains Bloomberg's Gurman. Apple is also rumored to be considering gray, gold, and silver color options for the new MacBook Pro.\nMockup of the new MacBook Pro OLED touch strip by Martin Hajek\nThe most intriguing addition to the MacBook Pro is the secondary display above the keyboard. Designed to replace the function keys, Bloomberg reports that it will be a strip-like screen that shows functions on a task-by-task basis and will simplify keyboard shortcuts. The panel could show media controls when iTunes is open, or cut and paste commands when Microsoft Word is running.\nApple has been widely criticized for still selling a four-year-old MacBook Pro model without a Retina display. Mac fans have been waiting anxiously for a MacBook Pro refresh, and the current Retina MacBook Pro is more than 440 days into its cycle, despite refreshes usually appearing every 268 days on average in the past. Apple has not yet announced an official date for its iPhone event (rumored for September 7th), and it's possible the company could now refresh its MacBook Pro line without an onstage event.",

        "body": "We're just one month out from a new iPhone release, but news of next year's model can't seem to stop seeping out. According to Bloomberg, the 2017 iPhone will no longer contain the iconic home button Apple fans have grown accustomed to over the last decade. The news pairs well with other reports of next year's iPhone, which will mark the device's 10th anniversary, using OLED display technology. That would allow the entire front of the device to \"appear like a single sheet of glass,\" according to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal in June.\nThat's not the only big change rumored for the 2017 iPhone. Nikkei Asian Review reported earlier this week that Apple may introduce a third, premium smartphone next year with a curved display not unlike Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. In fact, the report states Samsung may even be the supplier for these curved OLED displays.\nFor those wondering what will change with the upcoming iPhone 7, the device is said to remove the headphone jack in favor of the Lightning port, contain two rear cameras, and a memory boost to 3GB of RAM, according to separate report from Bloomberg. It will also contain a pressure-sensitive home button that relies on the same type of vibrating haptic feedback used in the Apple Watch and the trackpad of the new Apple MacBook.",

        "title": "Leaked \u2018iPhone 7 Plus\u2019 packaging indicates Lightning EarPods and Lightning 3.5mm headphone jack adaptor bundled in the box",
        "body": "An interesting image is making the rounds today: a photograph of a purported packaging insert for Apple\u2019s upcoming new phone. If the photo is to be believed, Apple will indeed be calling its larger new phone the \u2018iPhone 7 Plus\u2019, with the \u2018iPhone 7\u2019 name being taken by the 4.7 inch sibling.\nIt also indicates that Apple will be bundling Lightning EarPods in the box with every iPhone 7, as a consequence of the missing 3.5mm headphone jack. More interestingly, the leak suggests Apple will also be including a Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack adaptor as a bundled accessory.\nFull photo of the pamphlet after the jump \u2026\nMany were expecting Apple to make an adapter to allow customers to use existing earbuds and headphones with the new iPhone (which will not include an analogue 3.5mm jack in the hardware) but Apple\u2019s usual trend is to sell these adaptors as separate purchases.\nTaking this leaked packaging as legitimate, iPhone 7 owners will be able to connect their existing 3.5mm headphones without spending any additional money as the necessary adapter will be included in the same box as the phone itself. A pleasant change for a company with a reputation for selling pricey dongles and adaptors as extras.\nOther tidbits include the way the EarPods are described: \u2018EarPods with Lightning Connector\u2019. This suggests that the headphones themselves will be identical aside from a change of ports. Apple has trademarked the \u2018AirPods\u2019 name for wireless headphones but these will be additional accessories (pricing unknown) and not bundled. The pamphlet also shows the 256 GB storage designation mirroring previous rumors.\nThe pamphlet includes the usual legal terms you would expect to see on an Apple product sheet and appears quite convincing. Unfortunately, it is quite easy to fake an image like this so it\u2019s hard to say for sure if this is real. Packaging leaks have often turned up correct in the past with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor branding leaking out ahead of Apple\u2019s official unveiling of the iPhone 5s in 2013.\nWe\u2019ll know for sure next week, as Apple has announced a media press event for Wednesday, September 7. The company is expected to unveil its new iPhone 7 flagship lineup as well as the Apple Watch 2. New Macs are in the works but most sources are downplaying any appearance of Mac hardware at next week\u2019s presentation. 9to5Mac will be bringing live coverage of all the announces so stay tuned.",

        "body": "An escalating battle between Apple Inc. and Spotify Ltd. is leaving some musicians caught in the crossfire.\nSpotify has been retaliating against musicians who introduce new material exclusively on rival Apple Music by making their songs harder to find, according to people familiar with the strategy. Artists who have given Apple exclusive access to new music have been told they won\u2019t be able to get their tracks on featured playlists once the songs become available on Spotify, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing the steps. Those artists have also found their songs buried in the search rankings of Spotify, the world\u2019s largest music-streaming service, the people said. Spotify said it doesn\u2019t alter search rankings.",

        "body": "A little more than a month ago Apple gave a limited-edition rainbow colored Apple Watch band to its employees who marched in San Fransisco\u2019s LGBT Pride parade. With no official release in sight and no worthy alternatives on the market, it seemed the only way to get your hands on one was to pay insane eBay prices. But that\u2019s all changed this morning. Clockwork Synergy, a watch accessory maker based in Maryland, has just launched a Pride version of its Classic NATO Apple Watch band featuring a rainbow design that looks nearly identical to the one Apple gifted its employees. What\u2019s more, both bands are made of nylon.\nClockwork Synergy\u2019s Pride band is available in 38mm/42mm with 2 buckle and 7 adapter color options so you can customize it to fit your style. Its 11 adjustability holes should fit \u201cmost wrist sizes.\u201d Better yet, the band is covered under a 1-year warranty in case you happen to run into any issues.\nThe Clockwork Synergy Pride 2-Piece Classic NATO Bands for Apple Watch are priced at $24.95, but if you use coupon code 9to5mac20 at checkout you\u2019ll knock $4.99 off your order. That brings your total down to just $19.96 with free shipping.",

        "body": "Apple might be getting rid of the 16GB iPhone in September, but we're not quite there yet, and in the meantime Google has created a fantastic Google Photos commercial that showcases the app's \"free up space\" feature. The ad features one missed photo after another \u2014 selfies, graduations, birthdays, Bigfoot sightings, etc. \u2014 all because of a phone that has run out of storage. (And yes, this is a headache that some Android users also face.) Google wants you to know that it's come up with a solution to this potential crisis: once they've been backed up to the cloud, Google Photos can erase the local copy of photos and videos captured with your smartphone.\nThat's an incredibly useful feature, especially when paired with the unlimited storage you get if you choose the \"high quality\" backup option in Google Photos. It's also the type of convenience that could easily lock you into sticking with Google Photos long into the future. Because moving photos from one online service to another is a miserable experience that we should only have to experience once or maybe twice in this life.",
