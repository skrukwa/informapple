        "title": "T-Mobile shifting entirely to unlimited data in new bid to shake up industry",
        "body": "T-Mobile will shift to a single wireless plan offering unlimited data \u2014 a surprise move that the company\u2019s CEO, John Legere, says he doesn\u2019t believe rivals Verizon and AT&T will be able to match.\nLegere announced the new plan, \u201cT-Mobile One,\u201d in a video this morning. Under the new plan, the Bellevue, Wash.-based wireless company will charge $70/month for the first line, $50/month for the second, and $20/month for additional lines up to eight, if the customer has auto-pay enabled. That averages to $40/month for a family of four, the company notes.\nThe plan includes unlimited talk, texting and 4G LTE smartphone data.\n\u201cI declare that the era of the data plan is over,\u201d says Legere in the video announcing the \u201cUn-carrier 12\u201d initiative. \u201cWe are completely destroying the whole concept of a data plan, it\u2019s gone. We have one single offer that banishes data buckets forever.\u201d\nThe new T-Mobile One plan begins on Sept. 6. The company says existing T-Mobile customers will be able to stay with their current plans or shift to the new T-Mobile One unlimited plan.\nWhether the new initiative is a deal for T-Mobile\u2019s customers depends on how much data they use. Under the company\u2019s existing Simple Choice plan, which comes with data limits, a customer pays $95/month for the first line of unlimited data. A plan with 6GB of data costs $65/month, and one with 2GB of data costs $50/month.\nBy setting a higher entry-level price of $70/month, the new plan is a risk for T-Mobile. Financial analysts homed in on that risk in their questions for executives, asking if the move could reduce the company\u2019s additions of postpaid subscribers, who pay at the end of a billing period, have better credit than their prepaid peers, and are generally considered more valuable customers.\nHowever, T-Mobile executives said the majority of the company\u2019s postpaid customer base is on family plans, making the $40/month average for a four-line plan the more relevant cost.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not get too mathematical about it,\u201d said Mike Sievert, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, addressing questions on that topic during a conference call this morning with analysts and reporters. \u201cThis is the single most consistent thing our customers have ever asked for. Over 1 million times in social media, they\u2019ve said, \u2018Could you just set my data free?\u2019 \u201d\n[Related: Sprint CEO calls T-Mobile CEO a \u2018con artist,\u2019 accuses rival of copying new unlimited data plan]\nT-Mobile says in a news release, \u201cAs with T-Mobile Simple Choice, those using the most data, the highest 3% \u2013 currently people using more than 26 GB of high-speed data per month \u2013 may see their data traffic prioritized behind other users once they cross that threshold during their billing month. As a result, they may notice relatively slower speeds but only at specific times and places that may experience high network demand or congestion.\u201d\nThe new T-Mobile One plan will come with unlimited mobile hotspot data, letting subscribers use their phone to connect a computer or other device to the network, but at 2G speeds. Speaking on the conference call this morning, T-Mobile executives said a premium option will be available with a higher-speed hotspot. Update: T-Mobile says the premium hotspot option will cost $15/month extra for 5GB of high-speed data.\nWireless video will stream at 480p standard definition, and the company will charge a $25/month premium for an \u201cHD add-on\u201d providing higher-definition video streaming.\nSpurred by the arrival of Legere as CEO in 2012, T-Mobile\u2019s \u201cUn-carrier\u201d announcements over the past few years have helped the company add more than 1 million net customers for 13 straight quarters, or more than three years.\nThe company\u2019s past Un-carrier moves have included unbundling the cost of the phone from the wireless plan, paying customers\u2019 fees when they switch from another carrier, no-extra-charge roaming in Canada and Mexico, the ability to stream video and music without counting against data caps, the T-Mobile Tuesdays loyalty program, issuing company shares to subscribers, and other initiatives.",

        "title": "Apple sells more iPads to businesses than consumers",
        "body": "While Apple's iPad sales continue to decline overall, the tablet is surging in demand from an unlikely source. The New York Times reports that nearly half of all iPad sales are to corporations and governments, with high-end iPad sales to business customers particularly strong. \"Apple is stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers,\" says Forrester analyst Frank Gillet, in a statement to the Times.\nThe boost from businesses and governments would have seemed highly unlikely six years ago when the iPad was originally launched, but Apple has been keen to woo businesses over to its mobile tablet in recent years. Apple teamed up with IBM to launch a range of business-focused iOS apps back in December 2014, and the company has also been working with Cisco and SAP to ensure iPads work well in enterprises.\nApple even teamed up with Microsoft to make the iPad Pro a success. During the tablet's launch, Microsoft's Office chief, Kirk Koenigsbauer, jumped on stage to demonstrate Office for iPad Pro. Microsoft has consistently tweaked its Office software for the iPad Pro ever since to make it more powerful, and the productivity suite even features in Apple's latest iPad Pro commercial. Apple wants everyone to believe that the iPad Pro is a real computer capable of real work, and it's clear that businesses are adopting it that way for their mobile computing needs.\nApple's success in the enterprise is unusual\nApple's fresh success in the enterprise is unusual for the company. Microsoft has typically dominated desktop computing inside businesses, and Steve Jobs always focused Apple on building products that consumers would love. Jobs even called IBM's best customers an \"orifice,\" and famously gave IBM the finger in a classic photo during the \u201880s era when Apple competed aggressively with IBM. Apple even aired a commercial depicting IBM as Big Brother from the George Orwell novel.",

        "title": "Tim Cook completes 5 years at Apple as CEO",
        "body": "Today marks the fifth anniversary since Tim Cook was named Apple CEO on August 24, 2011, the same day that late co-founder Steve Jobs stepped down as chief executive for the final time and recommended the board of directors appoint Cook as his permanent successor.\nUpon reaching the five-year mark, Cook has today unlocked previously awarded stock bonuses currently worth over $100 million. The bonuses are tied to both his tenure and Apple's performance under his leadership, including its total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 index.\nCook's bonus includes 700,000 tenure-based restricted stock units that vested today as part of a larger compensation package of over 4.7 million shares awarded on August 24, 2011, in addition to his first of six annual installments of 280,000 tenure-based restricted stock units that vested today. The combined 980,000 shares are valued at nearly $106.7 million based on AAPL's closing price of $108.85 on Tuesday.\nCook's bonus could be even higher if Apple's total shareholder return is in the middle third or top third relative to other companies in the S&P 500 from August 25, 2013 through August 24, 2016. He will receive another 140,000 RSUs for middle third performance, or 280,000 RSUs for top third performance. AAPL has risen around 52% since August 25, 2013, while the S&P 500 has risen around 32% in the same time period, making at least a middle third finish a strong possibility.\nA restricted stock unit, or RSU, is a form of compensation valued in terms of company stock, but the stock is not issued at the time of the grant. Instead, the recipient gets shares of stock at a later date, generally only if they are still employed by the company. Cook personally requested that his award be modified to adhere to a more performance-based compensation system in 2013. Another 700,000 of his RSUs are scheduled to vest on August 24, 2021, plus 280,000 RSUs each August 24 through 2021.\nCook's net worth, assuming he remains with the company through August 24, 2021 and meets performance targets, is estimated to be over $500 million based on his current stock options and RSUs awarded. He has previously pledged to donate the vast majority of his wealth, including stock bonuses like these, to charities in his lifetime. In May 2015, for example, Cook donated approximately 50,000 shares of Apple stock, then worth approximately $6.5 million, to undisclosed charities.\nCook has overseen the launch of the Apple Watch, MacBook Pro with Retina display, ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook, iPad Pro, several iPhone and iPad models, Apple Maps, Apple Music, Apple Pay, Siri, and many other products and services since taking over the reigns in 2011. Apple became the world's most valuable company in 2012 under his leadership, and it continues to hold that title today. Apple stock has risen over 132% since Cook was appointed as CEO five years ago.\nUpdate: Cook has netted another 280,000 shares of Apple stock, as the company returned 61% during the past three years, placing it in the top-performing third of the S&P 500 index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The additional shares were valued at approximately $30 million based on AAPL's closing price of $108.03 on Wednesday.",

        "body": "Update: Best Buy looks to be sold out in most areas.\nApple Watch prices have been in a relative freefall in recent months with the oft-rumored upgrade expected in the coming weeks. However, we aren\u2019t expecting a sea change upgrade this time around. Three weeks ago, a KGI report noted that the new Apple Watch 2 upgrade would include GPS, better waterproofing and improved performance but retain the same design. Another report last week reaffirmed those claims.\nA launch alongside the iPhone 7 next month seems obvious. Apple, therefore, is likely in a hurry to clear current inventory (indeed shortages are already being seen) ahead of the launch and that takes the form of a $199 price tag on the base model Apple Watch Sport 38mm Space Gray Aluminum Case\u2026\nAs 9to5Toys notes, a new Apple Watch hit the $199.oo price point last night at Best Buy, marking a new milestone in the pricing. Apple and other retailers almost always price match (but it is easiest to get at online at Best Buy\u2019s ebay storefront) so effectively the price of the Apple Watch now starts at $199 at retail in the US. Open Box models start at $180 and there are a wide variety of options including 42mm models.\nThe price is $100 off of Apple\u2019s retail price which was reduced by $50 earlier this year from its original $349 base launch price.\nI would guess that even after the update, the original Apple Watch will still sell for around $200 so if you have been waiting on a $200 Apple Watch, I think it is still a safe time to buy. At $200, Apple Watch competes well with other fitness bands and you get so much more, especially with watchOS 3 waiting in the wings.\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for more hands-on videos and reviews\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "title": "Tim Cook, the interview: Running Apple \u2018is sort of a lonely job\u2019",
        "body": "CEO Tim Cook says Apple has tried to be more transparent under his watch. Except for one thing: \u201cWe try to be as secretive as we\u2019ve always been on products, although it\u2019s increasingly difficult to do that.\u201d (Andrew Burton/For The Washington Post)\nOn a sleek white coffee table in Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s fourth-floor office in late July, beneath framed posters of Robert F. Kennedy, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jackie Robinson, a rose gold iPhone 6s sits in its original box. Earlier that morning, Cook had stood in front of employees at Apple headquarters and held up the phone, which a staffer had hand-delivered from a store in Beijing to commemorate a notable occasion: Apple had sold its billionth iPhone.\nThat celebratory milestone \u2014 Cook laughs when asked by a reporter if he\u2019ll stop counting, as McDonald\u2019s did with its hamburgers \u2014 aptly coincides with another big moment for the technology giant\u2019s chief executive. A few weeks later, Cook would mark the fifth anniversary of what has been the most closely watched transition of power in corporate history: On Aug. 24, 2011, just six weeks before his death, Apple\u2019s iconic founder, Steve Jobs, permanently handed his chief operating officer the reins. \u201cIt\u2019s been a blur in a lot of ways,\u201d says Cook, who had filled in for Jobs during medical leaves. \u201cIt feels like it was yesterday in some respects.\u201d\nIt is fitting that these two milestones arrive so close together. That\u2019s because the iPhone, launched by Jobs, has been the biggest driver of Apple\u2019s massive growth during Cook\u2019s tenure. It led the company to soaring valuations and accounted for nearly two-thirds of Apple\u2019s revenue in the past year. Just the tally on iPhone sales, almost $141 billion over the past four quarters, is more than the annual sales figures of Cisco, Disney and Nike \u2014 combined.\nBut the iPhone has been a source of recent disappointment, too. In its most recent quarter, iPhone sales fell 23 percent from a year ago, contributing to a 14.6 percent drop in overall revenue. It was Apple\u2019s second straight quarterly drop in sales after 13 years of growth.\nJust after Apple disclosed those results, Cook sat down with The Washington Post to discuss his first five years in one of corporate America\u2019s most glaring spotlights. In two sprawling and self-reflective interviews \u2014 one in his office and another by phone just before he left for vacation in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks \u2014 Cook described why the visibility of the job has been \u201cshocking,\u201d how he\u2019s learned to deal with the scrutiny, and who he\u2019s turned to for advice at pivotal moments (Warren Buffett, on his decision to return cash to shareholders, and Anderson Cooper about publicly disclosing he is gay).\nHe spoke in candid terms about the mistakes he\u2019s made on the way, such as his first hire to run Apple\u2019s retail stores (\u201cthat was clearly a screw-up\u201d). He fiercely defended Apple\u2019s tax policies. He touched on succession planning and the importance of grooming internal candidates. He was at his most spirited when talking about privacy and the long-term future of Apple and the iPhone \u2014 calling Apple\u2019s big presence in the smartphone industry \u201ca privilege, not a problem\u201d \u2014 and quieted considerably when talking about Jobs\u2019s memory. \u201cI know this sounds probably bizarre at this point,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I had convinced myself that he would bounce.\u201d\nCook, 55, chooses his words carefully, taking long pauses and speaking with a slight Alabama drawl. Though he has favorite phrases \u2014 many things are \u201cdeep,\u201d and Apple\u2019s mission is always its \u201cNorth Star\u201d \u2014 he eschews the jargon many CEOs use. And while he\u2019s quick to trumpet Apple, he is also unassuming, quickly noting, after saying his job can be \u201clonely,\u201d that \u201cI\u2019m not looking for any sympathy. CEOs don\u2019t need any sympathy.\u201d\nThat reflects how Cook\u2019s imprint on Apple has often been described \u2014 making it more systematic, more transparent, more team-oriented, more humble. He has engaged on social issues more than most CEOs, writing op-eds on legislation that limits gay rights and making the extraordinary decision earlier this year to oppose the FBI\u2019s request to unlock the San Bernardino killer\u2019s phone.\nAs CEO, he gets high marks for managing the company\u2019s growth, keeping margins high and expanding further into markets such as China (Apple had four retail stores in China five years ago. Today it has 41.) He has pushed into the enterprise market, grown Apple\u2019s product lineup and positioned Apple to make more money off the devices it\u2019s already sold: Its services business, which includes things like iTunes, iCloud and a mobile payments service, is projected to be the size of a Fortune 100 business next year \u2014 all on its own. Apple remains the most valuable and most profitable company in the S&P 500 index.\nYet as the company deals with declining sales in its major device categories and in markets like China, critics and some investors have fretted about Apple\u2019s innovation mojo under Cook. The first all-new device during his tenure, the Apple Watch, is not yet a mega hit. The iPhone juggernaut faces a saturated smartphone market, growing competition from low-cost start-ups and longer upgrade windows from consumers. Rumored big concepts behind the curtain \u2014 such as a reported car project \u2014 appear to be years away.\nSome analysts say such impatience is shortsighted, and that the long-term potential for things like services, augmented reality and even a possible car could ultimately transform the way Cook\u2019s tenure is viewed. \u201cInvestors are so finicky that they lose track of the big picture,\u201d says Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray who covers Apple. \u201cI think the wisdom and legacy of Tim Cook is going to be determined by what happens in the next five years.\u201d\nIn the conversation below, Cook looks back as well as ahead at those next five years \u2014 hinting at augmented reality but refusing to comment about a car project, saying Apple believes people love a surprise. It has been edited for length and clarity.\nApple CEO Tim Cook talks about when it's important to seek out advice, and who he turns to when he does. (Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post)\nYour first day in this job, you sent a memo to employees that said, \u201cI want you to be confident that Apple is not going to change.\u201d Five years later, it has to have changed. What qualities of Apple are immutable, in your view?\nThe DNA of the company is really what I was talking about there. The North Star has always been the same, which for us, is about making insanely great products that really change the world in some way \u2014 enrich people\u2019s lives. And so our reason for being hasn\u2019t changed.\nOther things do change. But that\u2019s the thread that ties everyone together.\nAnd what has changed?\nThe obvious things are we have more employees. The company is four times larger [by revenue since 2010]. We\u2019ve broadened the iPhone lineup. That was a really key decision and I think a very good one. We\u2019ve gone into the Apple Watch business, which has gotten us into wellness and in health. We keep pulling that string to see where that takes us. Lots of core technology work has been done.\nAre there ways the culture has evolved?\nWe have stepped up our social responsibility. We have talked about things and been more transparent about what we\u2019re doing \u2014 not on products: We try to be as secretive as we\u2019ve always been on products, although it\u2019s increasingly difficult to do that.\nThe real test is: Are you creating a ripple that helps other people as well? An example of that is the environmental work. We\u2019ve had environmental work going on at Apple for decades, but we didn\u2019t talk about it, and we didn\u2019t set aspirational kind of objectives. We used the same philosophy we do with our products, which is you unveil them when you\u2019ve finished. But we stepped back and re-evaluated that and said, \u201cYou know, if we wait until you do that, we\u2019re not helping anyone else get there, too.\u201d\nYou\u2019ve said you don\u2019t want to be a traditional CEO. What do you mean by that?\nI think of a traditional CEO as being divorced from customers. A lot of consumer company CEOs \u2014 they\u2019re not really interacting with consumers.\nI also think that the traditional CEO believes his or her job is the profit and loss, is the revenue statement, the income and expense, the balance sheet. Those are important, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re all that\u2019s important. There\u2019s an incredible responsibility to the employees of the company, to the communities and the countries that the company operates in, to people who assemble its products, to developers, to the whole ecosystem of the company. And so I have a maybe nontraditional view there. I get criticized for it some, I recognize. But I\u2019ve never wanted to be the stereotypical CEO. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be very good at it, honestly. And I don\u2019t think for Apple that would in the long run be good for the company. If you care about long-term shareholder return, all of these other things are really critical.\nTim Cook holds up the billionth iPhone sold as he shares the news with employees at Apple headquarters in July 2016. (Apple/Apple)\nYou\u2019ve got the billionth iPhone on the table here. One thing that has changed is that in 2011 about 44 percent of the company\u2019s sales came from iPhone. Now it\u2019s close to two-thirds. How can Apple move forward when so much of its business is tied up in the iPhone and an industry that\u2019s cooling off?\nThis is actually a privilege, not a problem. Think about this: What other products do you know where the ratio of people to the product, for a consumer electronics product, will be one-to-one over the long haul? I don\u2019t think there is another one.\nMeaning?\nThe global sales of PCs each year are about 275 million right now. That number\u2019s been declining. The global market for smartphones is 1.4 billion. Over time, I\u2019m convinced every person in the world will have a smartphone. That may take a while, and they won\u2019t all have iPhones. But it is the greatest market on Earth from a consumer electronics point of view.\nLook at the core technologies that make up the smartphone today and look at the ones that will be dominant in smartphones of the future \u2014 like AI. AI will make this product even more essential to you. It will become even a better assistant than it is today. So where you probably aren\u2019t leaving home without it today \u2014 you\u2019re really going to be connected to it in the future.\nThat level of performance is going to skyrocket. And there is nothing that\u2019s going to replace it in the short term or in the intermediate term, either.\nI realize that the people who are focused on this 90-day clock say, \u201cOh, my God, the smartphone industry only grew by 1 percent or decreased by 6 percent.\u201d You know, the global economy\u2019s not that great right now. But if you\u2019re in it for the long haul, this is the best market on earth.\nSo to those who ask where\u2019s the next big, world-changing category for Apple \u2014 it\u2019s sitting on this $231.5 billion pile of cash \u2014 are you saying there\u2019s nothing like the smartphone?\nTechnology is one of these industries where every week there\u2019s a new shiny object that people are skating to. Netbooks \u2014 look back, everybody was writing like netbooks were this unbelievable thing, everyone was asking us, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you making one?\u201d Same thing with the PDA. Remember what happened with the PDA? Up and down. It was like the hula hoop. Technology is full of those.\nI\u2019m not saying we\u2019re not going to do anything else. I\u2019m saying this is still an unbelievable product category to be in, and not just for this quarter, year or for years. So I would not want anybody to think this, oh, this \u201cbetter days are behind us\u201d thing.\nSome analysts have said that.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t bother me. Because honestly, they were saying that about Apple in 2001. They were saying it in 2005. They were saying it in 2007 \u2014 this stupid iPhone, whoever dreamed up this thing? Then they were saying that we peaked in 2010, then it was 2011. We got to $60 billion [in revenue], and they said you can\u2019t grow any more from this. Well, last year we were $230 billion. And, yes, we\u2019re coming down some this year. Every year isn\u2019t an up, you know. I\u2019ve heard all of it before. And I don\u2019t subscribe to it because it\u2019s traditional thinking in a lot of ways: You can\u2019t get large because you are large.\nHow do you make the case that Apple is still a long-term growth company?\nIn today\u2019s products we have services [iCloud, App Store, Apple Pay and the like], which over the last 12 months grew about $4 billion to over $23 billion [in sales]. Next year we\u2019ve said it\u2019s going to be a Fortune 100 company in size.\nWhat else? IPad. The iPad Pro. What we saw in this past quarter is that about half of the people who are buying one are using it at work. We have an enormous opportunity in enterprise. Last year we did $25 billion or so in it around the world. We\u2019re collaborating much better with key partners because it\u2019s important, if you\u2019re making a decision to use our products or anybody\u2019s products in the enterprise, that they work well together. And so we\u2019re working with Cisco because they\u2019re incredible with the network infrastructure. We\u2019re working with IBM, who\u2019s written a number of apps. We\u2019re working with SAP because they own the back of the house, in terms of the processing. They own three-quarters of the world\u2019s transactions, in terms of it running on their products.\nAnd then, of course, the markets. We have done fairly well in China. India is fast-growing, but our base there is smaller. One of the big things that has held India back is the cellular infrastructure. They have two major carriers putting in a lot of investment to bring 4G. You can imagine if you didn\u2019t have 4G today. You can\u2019t enjoy video on a 3G. Periodically you can, but not consistently. This is a game changer.\nAnd so I look at it and say: markets? Enterprise \u2014 huge. Geographies? India is one I\u2019ve talked about, but there are others. Products? We purposely don\u2019t talk about that one. But you can imagine. Step back and say what\u2019s Apple so great at? Apple is the only company that can take hardware, software and services and integrate those into an experience that\u2019s an \u201caha\u201d for the customer. You can take that and apply to markets that we\u2019re not in today. There\u2019s not a limitation that we can only do that in the smartphone area or in the tablet or Mac or watch area.\nDo you feel any frustration with investor impatience?\nWe welcome all investors, regardless of whether their horizon is short or long. But we try to be very clear that we are making our decisions based on long term. I think for investors that are focused on the long term, if you look at how we\u2019ve done in the past five years, our total shareholder return is over 100 percent. That\u2019s a pretty good number. And I think most people that have been in the stock for that period of time are probably pretty happy.\nTim Cook and Steve Jobs worked closely together for years. \u201cSteve\u2019s not replaceable,\u201d Cook says. (Kimberly White/REUTERS)\nYou succeeded one of the icons of American business. What does it feel like to step into those shoes?\nTo me, Steve\u2019s not replaceable. By anyone. [Voice softens] He was an original of a species. I never viewed that as my role. I think it would have been a treacherous thing if I would have tried to do it. When I first took the job as CEO, I actually thought that Steve would be here for a long time. Because he was going to be chairman, work a bit less after he came back up the health curve. So I went into it with one thought, and then weeks later \u2014 six weeks later, whatever \u2014\nQuickly.\nIt was very quickly. [The day he died] was sort of the worst day ever. I just \u2014 I had really convinced myself. I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point, but I had convinced myself that he would bounce, because he always did.\nWhat did you think you knew about leading Apple that turned out to be wrong?\nThere\u2019s nothing like sitting in the chair, so to speak. I was reminded that customers have a really deep love for the company. I started just getting an avalanche of customer mail. I don\u2019t mean complaints. Email. Positive. Negative. Points of view. Not the \u2018hey, this broke, I\u2019m mad.\u2019 Largely not that kind of stuff. Things much deeper than that. Moved by how they were treated in a store. Lots of people have written me about FaceTime and how they could be near their mother\u2019s or father\u2019s bedside before they died only because of it.\nApple CEO Tim Cook describes how co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs acted as cover for Apple, taking both praise and blame for the company. (Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post)\nBut what about in terms of running the company?\nI learned that the scrutiny was much higher than I thought. Media interest and scrutiny \u2014 social networking was taking off at that time \u2014 and so a lot of the \u201clove,\u201d so to speak, and interest from customers, I think, transfers to media interest as well. And so there\u2019s a lot of visibility on the company. We can do very few things without it being reported somewhere.\nYou and Alan Greenspan or Janet Yellen would probably have a lot to talk about. It seems like every word you say is scrutinized. How do you get used to that?\nYou don\u2019t. You\u2019re both praised and criticized, and the extremes are wide \u2014 very wide. And that can happen all in a day. You build up \u2014 my skin got materially thicker after August 2011. And I don\u2019t mean in a bad way. I don\u2019t mean that I\u2019m callous and don\u2019t care. I think I\u2019m a bit better today about compartmentalizing things and not taking everything so personally.\nThat was just downright shocking to me, honestly. I thought the visibility went with Steve, not the company. And so I thought with a different CEO, with me, that would instantly change. It didn\u2019t.\n\u201cI think every generation has the responsibility to enlarge the meaning of human rights,\u201d Tim Cook says. \u201cI do view that a CEO today of Apple should participate in the national discussion on these type of issues.\u201d (Andrew Burton/For The Washington Post)\nYou\u2019ve been more outspoken on social issues than any other CEO of a company your size. Do you think companies have a responsibility to publicly take on such issues as civil rights and climate change?\nI think everybody has to make their own decision about it. Maybe there are compelling reasons why some people want to be silent. I think for us, though \u2014 for a company that\u2019s all about empowering people through our products, and being a collection of people whose goal in life is to change the world for the better \u2014 it doesn\u2019t sit right with me that you have that kind of focus, but you\u2019re not making sure your carbon footprint isn\u2019t poisoning the place. Or that you\u2019re not evangelizing moving human rights forward. I think every generation has the responsibility to enlarge the meaning of human rights.\nI do view that a CEO today of Apple should participate in the national discussion on these type of issues.\nWho were you thinking about when you decided to write the op-ed where you publicly came out as gay?\nI was thinking about kids. I was getting notes from kids who knew I was gay, or assumed I was, because of something they had read on the Web. And they were kids who were distraught. Some had been pushed out by their families. They thought they couldn\u2019t achieve anything. They couldn\u2019t do anything. They were seeing the national discourse around it and feeling isolated and depressed. And I just thought \u2014 I\u2019ve got to do something.\nAnd you speaking out would do what?\nI thought it would minimally say you can do pretty good in this world and be gay. That it\u2019s not a limiter. It\u2019s okay to be. That it\u2019s okay to be honest about it. I figured if I could help one person, it would be worth it.\nIt had been planned for quite a long time. It was not something that was done in a moment, by any means. It was probably a year. Just thinking through what to say, how to say it, where to say it, how to do that in a way that advanced what I was trying to do.\nI wanted it to be in a business [publication]. That\u2019s what I know, that\u2019s who I am. There was a lot of work there. I visited people. I talked to Anderson Cooper at length \u2014 multiple times. Because I thought that the way that he handled his announcement was really classy. I was getting advice from people who I thought were really great people who had really deeply thought about it.\nThere are few jobs in corporate America that have the same scope, breadth and size as yours. Geopolitics. National security. Consumer retail. Global supply chains. The entertainment industry. It\u2019s mind-boggling. Where do you turn to for advice?\nWhoever I think can help me. When I was going through [the question of] what should we do on returning cash to shareholders, I thought who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn\u2019t have a bias? So I called up Warren Buffett. I thought he\u2019s the natural person, and so I try to go through that process on everyone. That doesn\u2019t mean I always do what they say. But I think it\u2019s incumbent on a CEO to not just listen to points of view but to actually solicit them. Because I think, if not, you quickly become insular. And you\u2019re sort of living in the echo chamber.\nWarren Buffett offered advice on returning money to shareholders when Tim Cook turned to him. (John Peterson/AP)\nIt took about a year of planning and long conversations with Anderson Cooper before Tim Cook came out publicly as gay \u2014 the first Fortune 500 CEO to do so. (Charles Sykes/AP)\nWho else?\nFor the hearing [in 2013 before the U.S. Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about Apple\u2019s tax practices], I\u2019ve never testified in front of Congress before. So I called up [Goldman Sachs CEO] Lloyd Blankfein, because I looked back to say who\u2019s done this before? I knew Lloyd and thought he\u2019d be honest with me. He gave me great advice. I called up President Clinton. He knows a lot about the politics. I\u2019d not met him through a political connection. I\u2019d met him through the foundation. And he was great. I went to Laurene, Steve\u2019s wife. Laurene has the lens of knowing me and deeply understanding Apple.\nAnd so, obviously, I get a lot of advice internal to Apple. But I think it\u2019s important on these things that are also new to the company to solicit some people outside, even if you conclude to not do what they say.\nWith the fight with the FBI, did you have any idea what you were getting into?\nWe knew it was going to be very, very difficult. And that the cards were stacked against us. But we spent a lot of time on \u201cwhat is right here?\u201d People who were really key on this decision are folks like [senior vice president of software engineering] Craig Federighi. This at its heart is a deep, deep technical question. You first have to understand that to do anything else.\nThe lightbulb went off, and it became clear what was right when we did the first piece of work: Could we create a tool to unlock the phone? After a few days, we had determined yes, we could. Then the question was, ethically, should we? We thought, you know, that depends on whether we could contain it or not. Other people were involved in this, too \u2014 deep security experts and so forth, and it was apparent from those discussions that we couldn\u2019t be assured.\nThe risk of what happens if it got out, we felt, could be incredibly terrible for public safety.\nWe knew the positioning on the outside would not be public safety. It would be security vs. privacy \u2014 security should win. But we went through the deep, deep, deep discussions on that. It became clear that the trade-off, so to speak, was essentially putting hundreds of millions of people at risk for a phone that may or may not have anything on it, and that likely didn\u2019t, because of other things that we knew about. We thought this actually is a clear decision. A hard one, but a clear one. Then it became more of a matter of how do we explain this. Because this is not easy. You can imagine. You just hear: locked phone. Terrorist. People dead. Why aren\u2019t you unlocking this?\nDid the FBI fight change how you view the mandate of your job?\nCustomers should have an expectation that they shouldn\u2019t need a PhD in computer science to protect themselves. So I think they depend on us to do some things on their behalf. So with that responsibility comes an obligation to stand up. And, in this case, it was unbelievably uncomfortable and not something that we wished for, wanted \u2014 we didn\u2019t even think it was right. Honestly? I was shocked that they would even ask for this. That was the thing that was so disappointing that I think everybody lost in the whole thing. There are 200-plus other countries in the world. Zero of them had ever asked this.\nYou\u2019ve talked about privacy being part of Apple\u2019s values. How personal is it for you? You\u2019re known as a very private person. You grew up gay in a red state. Did those early years have an impact on how you lead Apple and on your public stances about privacy?\nUndoubtedly, your childhood and your upbringing is a constant across your life in terms of the things you learn and your point of view.\nBut in terms of privacy, I wouldn\u2019t link the two. There\u2019s a broader thing in play. Privacy, in my point of view, is a civil liberty that our Founding Fathers thought of a long time ago and concluded it was an essential part of what it was to be an American. Sort of on the level, if you will, with freedom of speech, freedom of the press. The other thing is how all this data sits out there in different places. I do worry about people not really understanding deeply about what kinds of things are out there about them. So it\u2019s really both of those \u2014 not really the growing up in the South.\nBack in 2009, you said, \u201cWe believe in saying no to thousands of projects.\u201d Name one product or project in the past five years you have put on the shelf.\n[Laughs]. I don\u2019t know if I want to do that, because it gives competition some heads-up about things. But be assured that we have. More than one. Because the wonderful thing about Apple is there are many ideas about doing things. We have resources to do a few, but you can only do a few things deep and well, and so you have to say no and have debates about what things are in versus out. So more than one big thing has left the page.\nA week after launching the iPhone 5, Tim Cook apologized for Apple Maps, a software app included on the new phone that was met with widespread complaints. A month later, Cook pushed out software executive Scott Forstall and retail chief John Browett. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\nWhen you look back, are there mistakes you\u2019ve made that you\u2019ve learned something from?\nMaps was a mistake. Today we have a product we\u2019re proud of. But we had the self-honesty to admit this wasn\u2019t our finest hour and the courage to choose another way of doing it. That\u2019s important. It\u2019s the only way an organization learns. The classic big-company mistake is to not admit their mistake. They double down on them. Their pride or ego is so large that they can\u2019t say we did something wrong. And I think the faster you do that, the better \u2014 change gears to something else. If you\u2019re honest, people will give you the benefit of the doubt. But if you have your head stuck in the sand and you just keep doing it, I think you lose your employees and your customers as well.\nWhat else?\nI hired the wrong person for retail [former Dixons CEO John Browett] initially. That was clearly a screw-up. I\u2019m not saying anything bad about him. He didn\u2019t fit here culturally is a good way to describe it. We all talked to him, and I made the final decision, and it was wrong. We fairly quickly recognized it and made a change. And I\u2019m proud we did that. A lot of companies would have said, \u201cOh, he hasn\u2019t been here very long.\u201d But when you\u2019re looking at more time with [then] 50,000 people in retail \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of people that you\u2019re affecting in the wrong way. That was a mistake. I probably have a long list.\nThe adage that it\u2019s lonely \u2014 the CEO job is lonely \u2014 is accurate in a lot of ways. I\u2019m not looking for any sympathy. You have to recognize that you have blind spots. We all do. Blind spots move, and you want to not just have really bright people around you, but people who will push on you and people to bring out the best in you. People that amplify whatever you\u2019re good at. And then also the people who plug the parts that you\u2019re not and may never be.\nWhat are you reading?\nI have two books going right now: One is the Bobby Kennedy book [\u201cBobby Kennedy: The Making of a Liberal Icon,\u201d by Larry Tye] that just came out. The other is quite an old book. It\u2019s a Gandhi book [\u201cMohandas K. Gandhi, Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments With Truth\u201d] that I got interested in because we went to the Gandhi museum when we were in India recently. I tend to like nonfiction and particularly reading about people and how they lived and how they fought, and what motivated them and their philosophy and so forth.\nWhen Steve handed you the reins, he said Apple had never had an orderly transition of CEO, and he wanted that to happen. What are you doing now to make sure the next transition, whenever it happens, is orderly?\nAt the end of every board meeting, I discuss succession with the board because I might step off the wrong curb or something. We have the good discipline to do that. Then my role is to make sure that the board has great candidates to pick from internally. And I take that role extremely seriously. Look around at the great people I get to work with \u2014 there\u2019s some really just superb talent in the company.\nApple paid $3 billion for Beats in its largest acquisition ever. (Adam Berry/Getty Images For Apple)\nYou\u2019ve made more acquisitions at Apple, including the purchase of Beats, which was its largest ever, at $3 billion. At its current size, does Apple need big acquisitions like that to grow?\nDo we need them? No. But we always are looking for companies that have really talented people and great intellectual property, and when we find them we do acquire them. To put that into context, we\u2019ve acquired 15 to 20 companies a year for the last four years.\nDo you think there will be more at that size going forward?\nI think we\u2019ll continue to acquire companies. If you\u2019re asking me would we do another one the size of Beats \u2014\nOr bigger? You certainly could.\nWe clearly are capable of doing it both from a management-depth point of view and a financial point of view. But we\u2019d only do it if it were great for Apple strategically. We don\u2019t acquire for revenue. So the essential for us is the talent and/or [intellectual property]. Those are the things that we optimize around. Now with Beats, we also got revenue. But it wasn\u2019t the purpose of it. The purpose was that we were going into streaming \u2014 we\u2019d already made a decision to do that. And we looked around at people who might be able to help us.\nI think we got Apple Music out probably a little sooner than we would have otherwise. It\u2019s infused some great talent on the team.\nHow do you think about content being part of that services business going forward?\nWe are producing radio shows for Beats. We are producing some original content on video. We started that with a concert kind of video with Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve got \u201cPlanet of the Apps,\u201d kind of a cool show. We\u2019ve got a few things that are focused on Apple Music. We do view that the future of TV is apps. And if there\u2019s a way we can be a catalyst into that happening faster or better, then that would interest us in content.\nCustomers look at iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone SE mobile phones in an Apple Store in Beijing. (HOW HWEE YOUNG/EPA)\nSales in greater China were down 33 percent in the most recent quarter. Low-cost competitors like Huawei are getting into building premium phones. Let\u2019s talk about China. How much are you worried about competitive and regulatory threats there?\nWe make our investment decisions based on long term. We have to report every 90 days because that\u2019s the rules, but it\u2019s not how we run the company. So as I look in the long term, I think China is an unbelievable market \u2014 not only from a demand point of view and the revenue potential there, but also as a great source of talent. We have over a million and a half developers there. The reach is unbelievable. There are, sort of, speed bumps now with the economy. In a year-ago quarter, we were up 112 percent. So I think you have to back up and put it in perspective. If you look at it over a two-year basis, we were up over 50 percent in the quarter.\nWe were talking about getting advice from people before your first testimony on Capitol Hill. That hearing focused on the corporate taxes Apple pays. Apple is now awaiting a European Union ruling on whether you owe billions in back taxes, and corporate tax reform is a big election-year issue. Does either a Trump or a Clinton campaign give you or the company any hope that there could be corporate tax reform anytime soon?\nI think it\u2019s in the best interest of the U.S. to have corporate tax reform, regardless of which political party is in charge of the White House. Because if you look at it, the U.S. rules today are that international companies like us and many others can keep their earnings that they earn overseas overseas, and then when they bring them back it triggers the tax liability.\nWhat I\u2019ve always felt should happen is that every dollar should be taxed immediately with no deferral. But as a consequence of doing that, you should have free flow of capital. What would happen is if a system like that were put in place, it should have more investment going into the United States. We\u2019re the only major country in the world that has a system like this. It\u2019s not good for the U.S., it\u2019s not good for the economy, it\u2019s not good for jobs, it\u2019s not good for investments.\nI think there\u2019s wide agreement to that in both parties, by the way. There\u2019s a difference of view with different people about how to fix it, but I think everybody agrees the current system isn\u2019t working. So I\u2019m optimistic that, in 2017, there will be some sort of corporate tax reform. The U.S. needs to invest more in infrastructure \u2014 so what would be great is, if they take the tax proceeds of a corporate tax reform and invest it in infrastructure and roads and bridges and airports.\nWhat do you say in response to Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz\u2019s comments on Bloomberg [television], where he called Apple\u2019s profit reporting in Ireland a \u201cfraud\u201d?\nI didn\u2019t hear it. But if anybody said that, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Let me explain what goes on with our international taxes. The money that\u2019s in Ireland that he\u2019s probably referring to is money that is subject to U.S. taxes. The tax law right now says we can keep that in Ireland or we can bring it back. And when we bring it back, we will pay 35 percent federal tax and then a weighted average across the states that we\u2019re in, which is about 5 percent, so think of it as 40 percent. We\u2019ve said at 40 percent, we\u2019re not going to bring it back until there\u2019s a fair rate. There\u2019s no debate about it. Is that legal to do or not legal to do? It is legal to do. It is the current tax law. It\u2019s not a matter of being patriotic or not patriotic. It doesn\u2019t go that the more you pay, the more patriotic you are.\nAnd so what we\u2019ve said \u2014 we think it\u2019s fine for us to pay more, because right now we\u2019re paying nothing on that and we leave it over there. But we \u2014 like many, many other companies do \u2014 wait for the money to come back.\nIn the meantime, it\u2019s important to look at what we do pay. Our marginal rate, our effective rate in the U.S. is over 30 percent. We are the largest taxpayer in the United States. And so we\u2019re not a tax dodger. We pay our share and then some. We don\u2019t have these big loopholes that other people talk about. The only kind of major tax credit that we get is the R&D tax credit, which is available to all companies in the United States. That\u2019s important to know. The second thing I would point out is we have money internationally because we have two-thirds of our business there. So we earn money internationally.\nHow long are you willing to keep unrepatriated income overseas?\nHonestly, I believe the legislature and the administration will agree that it\u2019s in the best interest of the country and the economy to have tax reform. So I don\u2019t think I have to make that decision. I\u2019m optimistic that it will take place next year.\nTim Cook appeared before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to discuss Apple\u2019s tax practices. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\nDo you feel picked on by the E.U.?\nYou know, they haven\u2019t ruled yet. I don\u2019t know how they will rule. I hope that we get a fair hearing. If we don\u2019t, then we would obviously appeal it.\nIt\u2019s important for everyone to understand that the allegation made in the E.U. is that Ireland gave us a special deal. Ireland denies that. The structure we have was applicable to everybody \u2014 it wasn\u2019t something that was done unique to Apple. It was their law.\nAnd the basic controversy at the root of this is, people really aren\u2019t arguing that Apple should pay more taxes. They\u2019re arguing about who they should be paid to. And so there\u2019s a tug of war going on between the countries of how you allocate profits.\nLet\u2019s jump to Apple\u2019s future. You made some statements in the earnings call about artificial intelligence that got a lot of attention. Can Apple catch up with the AI efforts from companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon?\nLet me take exception to your question. Your question seems to imply that we\u2019re behind.\nLet\u2019s take a look at that. We\u2019ve been shipping Siri since 2011, and Siri is with you all of the time. Which I think most people would want an assistant with them all the time, whether they\u2019re at work or at home or in between or on the soccer field. You don\u2019t think of your to-do list, so to speak, only when you\u2019re in your kitchen. And the breadth of Siri is unbelievable. Increasingly, Siri understands things obviously without having to memorize certain ways to say things. The prediction of Siri is going way up. What we\u2019ve done with AI is focus on things that will help the customer. And we announced in June that we\u2019re opening Siri to third parties, so third-party developers can now use Siri. So a simple example with that, whatever kind of ride-sharing app you might use, Uber or Lyft in the United States, you could just \u2014 using your voice \u2014 order the car. So third-party developers are writing tons of those that will be available to the public in the fall. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re broadening Siri in a huge way.\nBut there are other things in there, like if you\u2019re typing in mail, the prediction capability of the next word or next phrase that you will use has just \u2014 Siri has gotten a lot smarter about that. The simple things, like do you drive to the airport? I haven\u2019t done that in a little while, but when I did, I always forgot where I put my car.\nI just take a picture of the sign on the wall.\nBut you don\u2019t even have to do that anymore because Siri will know where you parked. And so things like this really make a difference to people \u2014 we do all of that while protecting your privacy. Instead of passing all that information to the cloud, where we\u2019re maintaining it all, we do a lot of it on the device itself. So you\u2019re in control of your own data.\nDo you have a concern about privacy as you push into AI?\nNo. I think that talented people can come up with fantastic ways of using AI without violating privacy. There\u2019s a new technology called differential privacy which essentially looks at large data sets to predict user behaviors and requests without going to the precise individual, which might violate privacy.\nNow there are some things that we do look at \u2014 like if you buy songs, it\u2019s a reasonable expectation that we know what songs you buy because you buy them from us. And we use that information with machine learning to recommend other songs you might like.\nWhat about augmented or virtual reality?\nI think AR [augmented reality] is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it\u2019s something we\u2019re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about. [Laughs.]\nYou mentioned earlier about how much more difficult it is to keep things secret. There\u2019s been a number of reports about Apple\u2019s car project \u2014 the people who are being hired or moved into place to lead it. It gets enough attention that it almost seems like an open secret. Why not say something about it?\nI can\u2019t answer a question about something we haven\u2019t announced. [Laughs.]\nBut there\u2019s just constant attention about it. Is it tempting to share any kind of details?\nWe\u2019ve always viewed that people love surprises. We don\u2019t have enough anymore in our lives.\nSometimes it seems like Silicon Valley companies are all blending together \u2014 everyone\u2019s converging on the same big race. Self-driving cars, AI, Google is reportedly building a smartphone. In a tech industry where companies are trying to be \u201call things to all people,\u201d how does Apple\u2019s longtime philosophy of simplicity, and being very focused, move it forward?\nIt\u2019s as important as it ever was. We\u2019re a bit larger today, so we can do a bit more than we could do 10 years ago or even five years ago. But we still have, for our size, an extremely focused product line. You can literally put every product we make on this table. That really is an indication of how focused it is. I think that\u2019s a good thing. Regardless of who you are, there\u2019s only so many things that you can do at a very high-quality and deep, deep level \u2014 personally and in business. And so we\u2019re not going to change that. That\u2019s core to our model and way of thinking.\nApple has really ramped up spending in research and development. One analyst noted your [incremental] R&D is now greater than the 14 largest automakers, combined. What\u2019s the most exciting technology out there to you right now?\nThat one I don\u2019t want to answer, because it would give too much of an insight into the things we\u2019re doing. But we have ramped up R&D because we are heavily investing in the future \u2014 both in current product lines and things that aren\u2019t visible as well, including in services. In due time, some of those things will be visible. But there will always be other things that will replace those things that are invisible.\nAny final reflections on your tenure? Moments that stuck out at you?\nI\u2019ve got the best job in the world. I think about my day and weeks and months and years \u2014 I put them in three buckets: people, strategy and execution. I sort of move between those on a daily basis as to where I put my time. I always think the most important one of those is people. If you don\u2019t get that one right, it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of energy you have in the other two \u2014 it\u2019s not enough.",

        "body": "The 16GB iPhone option nobody wants could finally die this year. According to a new leak, Apple\u2019s upcoming iPhone 7 series will ship with 32GB of space as standard, while power users with plenty of cash will be able to get as much as 256GB.\nNo one who owns a 16GB iPhone chose that model because it\u2019s all the storage they wanted; they chose it because it was the cheapest iPhone. And now they spend their precious time deleting photos and videos to make room for more photos and videos.\nBut it looks like Apple\u2019s going to finally put an end to one of the most common first-world problems this year. A leaked storage specification sheet obtained by leaker The Malignant suggests the iPhone 7 will come with at least 32GB of storage.\nIt appears the 64GB option will also die and the 128GB option will become the mid-tier, while a new 256GB option will be made available for those who love to carry all the music and videos they\u2019ll ever need on the go.\nToshiba will supply some of those flash chips, according to the leak \u2014 though Apple could well be using other suppliers as well.\nThis news will be music to the ears of almost every iPhone fan \u2014 particularly those who can\u2019t spend the extra $100 on a mid-tier device. We\u2019ve been calling for the death of 16GB devices for years, and it looks like it\u2019s finally going to happen.\nThat\u2019s if this leak is genuine, of course.",

        "body": "AT&T chairman Randall Stephenson will soon announce that a consortium of 33 companies, including Apple, AT&T, Google and Comcast are joining the FCC in an effort to crack down on phone call spam made by robots, according to Reuters. In the inaugural \u201cRobocall Strike Force\u201d meeting, the companies will announce their initial plans on how to stop US phone owners from receiving advertorial spam run by automated machines \u2026\nThe AT&T CEO said the 33 companies, which includes tech smartphone giants Apple and Google, will work on solutions to present a concrete plan by October 19 in a couple of months time.\nRight now, there are no details on what methods the companies have in mind to combat the spam phone calls, or what role Apple will play. There is a possibility Apple could add technology into iOS that can detect robotic spam callers before the user picks up the phone.\nAlthough a plan is to be expected by October 19, a prospective date for implementation of the scheme is even more fuzzy.\nAT&T chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson will make the announcement at the first \u201cRobocall Strike Force\u201d meeting at the FCC later on Friday, the company said. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler in July wrote major companies about robocalls. The strike force will report to the commission by Oct. 19 on \u201cconcrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,\u201d Stephenson said.\n\u201cAccelerate the development and adoption\u201d gives no promises about when such changes could come into effect, likely taking many months or years for 33 companies to coordinate with each other. At this stage, it\u2019s not even clear how the stakeholders would achieve such a feat: just like email spam, combatting phone spam is a cat and mouse game.\nIn iOS 10, Apple has already started along this path with a new extension point for third-party app developers that lets the phone flag up known marketers. At WWDC, Apple advertised this feature in the context of the Chinese region (where phone spam is also very high) but it works worldwide. This is what Craig Federighi is demoing at the keynote in the image above.\nPhone adds integration for third-party VoIP calls, voicemail transcription and a new caller ID extension for spam alerts.\nHowever, Apple has not announced any plans to provide this data itself as of yet. If customers want to take advantage of the new iOS 10 feature, they will have to download third-party apps that offer the underlying database and provide integration with the system. iOS 10 is expected to launch next month in September.\nWe\u2019ll bring more details to follow on Apple\u2019s telephone spam efforts as they are announced.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Next on the docket for Apple Pay support appears to be Chick-Fil-A, according to a tweet from the restaurant chain.\nLast year, it was reported that Apple Pay support was coming to Chick-Fil-A locations around the country, but the rollout never fully began, though a handful of users have been able to use the service sporadically. According to today\u2019s tweet, however, Apple Pay will be accepted at all Chick-Fil-A locations as of this Friday, August 19th. The mobile payment platform will be supported in-store and in the drive thru.\nChick-Fil-A\u2019s adoption of Apple Pay comes after the company has experimented with QR-based solutions in the past. Those solutions ultimately failed, according to employees, much like other QR-based offerings we\u2019ve seen. Chick-Fil-A has, however, supported Apple Pay in its recently revamped app on iOS.\nApple keeps a list of retailers that support Apple Pay on its website, though it has not yet been updated to acknowledge Chick-Fil-A\u2019s support.

Bean.\nSome retailers, however, continue to resist Apple Pay. Just last week, CVS announced their own \u201cCVS Pay\u201d QR code-based mobile payments solution. Walmart also resists Apple Pay, instead opting for its own QR solution, Walmart Pay.\nAs is usually the case with Apple Pay rollouts in national chains, some users have already reported being able to use the service at their local Chick-Fil-A.

        "body": "The assumed names of this year's iPhone lineup -- \"iPhone 7\" and \"iPhone 7 Plus\" -- have been confirmed by \"reliable sources\" speaking with Japanese site Mac Otakara . The sources said that Apple is following this name scheme to avoid confusion of having back-to-back iPhones with \"S\" in the name, even though the iPhone 7 will largely be a minor update over the iPhone 6s.The new report nixes the chance for an additional third tier \"iPhone 7 Pro,\" which was a rumored dual-lens alternative to the single-lens \"iPhone 7 Plus\" early in the rumor cycle . The less-powerful camera option was said to be created by Apple as a fallback in case the dual-lens technology didn't pan out. Now that everything seems to be going well for the company in this area, and mockups have repeatedly shown a dual-lens camera enclosure, it makes sense for Apple to revert to the well-known \"Plus\" moniker for its next-generation 5.5-inch dual-lens iPhone, and drop any reference to \"Pro\" altogether.Otherwise,reiterates on the expected rumors of the iPhone 7: there won't be a 3.5 mm headphone jack, it will house an A10 chip, and it will introduce a new flush, capacitive Home Button in lieu of the traditional physical switch. That last aspect of the new iPhone has been a bit more up in the air in the weeks ahead of the September launch, since it's hard to fully decipher whether recent image mockups confirm one way or the other if the Home Button is pressure-sensitive or not.It's believed that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be revealed at an Apple event on September 7, with pre-orders beginning two days later on September 9. A recent leak from AT&T has pushed back the reported launch of the new iPhone, however, suggesting that Apple could be preparing a wide release on September 23 , although the original rumor of September 16 is also still a viable option.Article Link: New Report Confirms 'iPhone 7' and 'iPhone 7 Plus' Names, Effectively Ending 'iPhone 7 Pro' Rumors",

Apple has already made the change online, and all of its store pages now refer to stores by names like \"Apple Union Square\" or \"Apple Valley Fair\" or \"Apple The Grove,\" instead of \"Apple Store, Valley Fair\" or \"Apple Store, The Grove.\"\nIt's a change that appears to have started rolling out with the launch of the newer Apple Stores, like the Union Square location in San Francisco. Apple has always referred to that store as just Apple Union Square, and over the course of the last few days, the company has updated all of its retail store webpages to remove the \"Store\" branding. What was once \"Apple Store, Fifth Avenue,\" for example, is now just \"Apple Fifth Avenue.\"\nThe new website for The Grove Apple Store\nAn archived page for the Fifth Avenue Apple Store has the older branding as of August 12, suggesting this is a fairly recent change to Apple's retail plan.\nThe old website for The Grove Apple Store\nApple also recently sent out a memo to its retail employees, letting them know that the \"Store\" branding is gradually being dropped from both retail locations and online. While Apple told employees the change will be gradual and will start with new stores, pages for almost all stores have been updated to remove the \"Store\" titling.\nThe decision to remove the \"Store\" portion of Apple's line of retail locations likely has to do with efforts to turn newer stores into more than just simple stores, positioning them as gathering places for their communities. Apple Union Square, for example, features an outdoor plaza with regular acoustic performances and a 6K video wall with seating called \"The Forum,\" aimed at allowing artists, photographers, and musicians to inspire and educate customers through year-round programs, events, and classes.",

        "body": "Tim Cook\nAfter the unprecedented breach of hacking tools and exploits stolen from the US National Security Agency's elite hacking unit, some privacy advocates see it as clear vindication of Apple in its fight with the FBI earlier this year.\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\"The component of the government that is supposed to be absolutely best at keeping secrets didn't manage to keep this secret effectively,\" Nate Cardozo, a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Business Insider.\nIn February, a judge ordered Apple to help the FBI unlock an iPhone that was used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of two attackers who killed 14 people in a December terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. That order set off a vigorous debate between law-enforcement officials seeking evidence and technologists worried over broader implications for personal privacy.\nWhile the company's legal team fought the order, Apple CEO Tim Cook published a letter arguing against being forced to build a so-called backdoor that would subvert the encryption that not only kept the shooter's phone secure, but also the smartphones of millions of other Apple users.\nMost in the technology community rallied around Apple at the time, arguing that weakened encryption might help government investigators, but it would also make customers vulnerable to hackers.\nNow, with a massive top-secret archive of some of the NSA's own exploits having been leaked online, it appears they were right.\nNSA headquarters\n\"The NSA's stance on vulnerabilities seems to be based on the premise that secrets will never get out. That no one will ever discover the same bug. That no one will ever use the same bug. That there will never be a leak,\" Cardozo said. \"We know for a fact, that at least in this case, that's not true.\"\nThe government eventually backed down from its fight with Apple in late March, after investigators said they were able to unlock the shooter's phone with the \"a assistance of a third party.\" It never disclosed who that was or how it broke into the phone.\nStory continues\nExactly how the FBI got into the phone is yet another case where the government is holding on to \"zero days,\" or software exploits that are completely unknown to companies and users. These exploits, when found, are typically disclosed to vendors so they can fix the problem, used by hackers to break into systems more easily, or sold on the black market.\nBut Cardozo believes the FBI's exploit of the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone 5C, its still unknown exploit of the Tor web browser in another case, and NSA's apparent hoarding of exploits that have now been made public, raises a larger issue around the legalities of government hacking.\n\"When the government finds, creates, or discovers a vulnerability in a system, there are essentially two things they can do: They can disclose it, or they can use it,\" he said. \"But the rules around that are completely broken.\"\nThere are some guidelines around how the government is supposed to deal with vulnerabilities in what is called the Vulnerabilities Equities Process, a framework that is supposed to outline how and when it would make sense to disclose a vulnerability to an affected company if the larger security risk is greater than the reward it could yield.\nBut the VEP is just nonbinding guidance created by the Obama administration \u2014 not an executive order or law \u2014 that has no legal standing.\n\"We need rules, and right now there aren't any,\" Cardozo said. \"Or at least none that work.\"\nNOW WATCH: There\u2019s a glaring security problem with those new credit card chips\nMore From Business Insider",

        "title": "Mossberg: The post-Jobs Apple has soared financially, but lacks a breakthrough product",
        "body": "Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Recode.\nFive years ago last week, the legendary Steve Jobs stepped down as Apple\u2019s CEO after an amazing 14-year run that took the technology company from the edge of disaster to the heights of glory. He personally selected his COO, Tim Cook, as the new CEO, and passed away six weeks later.\nSo, how has Apple changed in the first five years of the Tim Cook era? How is it different than at the peak of the Jobs era?\nThe short answer is that the company has surged financially to heights Jobs likely never dreamed of. It has also refined its popular product line and retained most of its senior talent.\nBut Cook\u2019s Apple has yet to produce the kind of new, game-changing product Jobs was famous for launching. Or, if it has, we don\u2019t know it yet.\nHowever, hard as it may be to believe, five years may be too short a time in which to judge the Cook era. But with a new iPhone launch expected next week, it\u2019s worth looking back on how the company has changed in the past five years.\nDollars and Sales\nAs a longtime product reviewer, I\u2019m less interested in any company\u2019s financials than I am in its products. But the financials can\u2019t be ignored. You\u2019ll find a very good summary giving a sense of Cook\u2019s reign in this five-chart post by Recode editor-in-chief Dan Frommer.\nthis summer Apple sold its billionth iPhone\nBut there are some notable highlights. Over his five-year tenure as CEO, Cook has roughly doubled Apple\u2019s revenues and profits to an astounding $234 billion and $53 billion, respectively. Recent quarters have shown a rare downward trend, but the five-year pattern is still impressive. And this summer Apple sold its billionth iPhone, less than a decade after its introduction. That\u2019s fewer units than all Android phones combined, but phenomenal for a single, premium product line. In just one quarter last December, iPhone sales exceeded the annual total for Jobs\u2019s entire last year in fiscal 2011. But, again, sales have recently been declining.\nEvolving products\nCook has evolved Apple\u2019s core products in ways we don\u2019t know whether Jobs would have done, with considerable success. In 2014, he launched two models of the iPhone 6, one of which matched the large screen size of Samsung\u2019s phones. It was well done, and sales soared. Last year slightly revised 6S models in the same sizes also sold well, but Apple followed up with an unconventional move in the iPhone SE, a reworking of the smaller iPhone 5S with modern internals that proved surprisingly popular.\nCook has evolved Apple\u2019s core products with considerable success\nCook also introduced a huge 13-inch iPad Pro, with a snap-on physical keyboard, which Jobs thought unnecessary, and a stylus, which Jobs mocked and hated, even scorning the idea during the original iPhone launch. This year, Cook followed up with a smaller iPad Pro. The iPad Pro is doing well in the enterprise market, but it doesn\u2019t appear to have yet reversed overall falling iPad sales.\nCook has also launched a beefed-up, app-based, Apple TV, which finds itself in a crowded, confusing market of set-top boxes and so-called smart TVs. But it\u2019s only a remnant of a major TV product, replete with a new programming service, that the company had long been hoping to provide. The new Apple TV is ambitious, but lags in sales behind Roku and Amazon devices, partly due to its high price of $149 for the base model, and $199 for a model with more memory.\nNew Products\nWhen Jobs was CEO, he dazzled the tech world by running the table with a string of new products that other companies scrambled to match: the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, the MacBook Air, and the iPad. That\u2019s a hard act to follow, and Apple has struggled to do so in the last five years.\nCook\u2019s biggest hardware bet, the Apple Watch, which began shipping last year, dominates the tiny global market for smartwatches, but has yet to become either the tech must-have or the popular fashion accessory it was meant to be. A new model may appear as soon as next week, with a completely revised user interface, which is in effect an admission that the initial interface wasn\u2019t good enough.\nMeanwhile, the Mac lineup has stagnated, with some models approaching years without an update. The only new Mac introduced recently is the MacBook, which offers a vision of the future, but is costly, slow, requires adapters to work with its forward-looking single USB-C port, and has an odd, flat keyboard I find uncomfortable. Updates to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro are reported to be in the works, however.\nthe Mac lineup has stagnated\nApple Pay, a contactless payment system for recent iPhones and the Apple Watch, is making steady progress, but it depends on external factors, like merchant acceptance.\nApple Music, the company\u2019s new streaming service based on its acquisition of Beats, is being overhauled in iOS 10 \u2014 at least in terms of its user interface \u2014 because it was lambasted for complexity and errors.\n3D Touch, a new navigation tool that detects pressure on the iPhone screen to perform quick actions and peer into items like emails without opening them, hasn\u2019t gained wide acceptance. It\u2019s in some apps, but it\u2019s still too hard to discover, missing on the iPads, and absent on Apple\u2019s surprisingly popular iPhone SE.\nMitigating Factors\nBut there are some major mitigating factors. First, the global economy is in the slowest economic recovery anyone can recall. Second, Cook is having to compete with a much more polished Android and a much more polished line of Samsung phones than Jobs ever did. The smartphone market in developed countries seems saturated. PC and tablet replacement cycles are longer.\nJobs\u2019 successes didn\u2019t happen overnight\nFinally, it\u2019s crucial to remember that Jobs\u2019 successes didn\u2019t happen overnight. While it was introduced in 2001, the iPod didn\u2019t really take off big time until 2004\u20132005. And it took a few years from its 2007 launch for the iPhone to begin hitting double digit quarterly unit sales. So the jury is out on the Apple Watch.\nExpanding Markets\nCook\u2019s real innovation may lie in his efforts to broaden the company\u2019s markets. He has worked tirelessly to grow Apple\u2019s presence in China, even in the face of some great native Chinese phones. And, in a move Jobs would likely have scorned, he has partnered with enterprise companies like IBM, Cisco, and Box to sell vastly more Apple devices into big companies by creating specialized apps and tools for them. This effort especially focuses on the iPad, whose consumer sales have been crumbling.\nBut, again, it\u2019s much too soon to know if these bets will be winners or losers in the long run.\nPrivacy and Security\nCook has shown a big commitment to both privacy and security by encrypting most iPhone data end-to-end and in a way that even Apple can't decrypt it. And he showed real guts earlier this year by refusing an FBI demand that he weaken that encryption to help the Bureau search a dead suspect\u2019s phone. He argued any software Apple built to do that would likely fall into the hands of bad actors and be sought by dictatorships worldwide.\nJobs was personally committed to privacy and security, and though we can\u2019t know if he would have put the company on the line in this fight, Cook was firm in protecting the values of the company.\nWhat\u2019s next\nWith iPhone and company sales falling in recent quarters, and likely to do so again, Apple needs the all-new product breakthrough that has eluded Cook \u2014 sooner rather than later. The company is seriously working on augmented reality, though I don\u2019t know details. Like everyone else, it\u2019s toiling away on artificial intelligence and machine learning, though it\u2019s focused more on building smarts into individual devices rather than in the cloud, like most of its competition. And it continues to work on automotive technology, though it isn\u2019t clear whether that means an entire car.\nRight now, Apple just needs an exciting new iPhone\nBut all of those potential payoffs are a way off. Right now, Apple just needs an exciting new iPhone. After I saw Samsung\u2019s gorgeous new Galaxy S7 in March, I wrote a column calling for the next iPhone to be \"spectacular.\" Based on rumors, that much oomph may not be in the offing until 2017.",

        "title": "MacBook Pro with new 'touchscreen strip' won't appear at September 7th iPhone event, says Bloomberg",
        "body": "Apple is preparing a big update to its MacBook Pro line of laptops. KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo first revealed that Apple is planning to replace the function keys on the MacBook Pro with an OLED touch bar, and now Bloomberg's Mark Gurman is confirming the initial reports. The new MacBook Pros are said to be slightly thinner than current models, with a slightly wider trackpad and an option for AMD Polaris graphics in at least one model.\nBloomberg says that Apple isn't planning to unveil the new MacBook Pros at an event on September 7th, where it's expected to launch a new iPhone and additional Apple Watch models. Apple is also expected to include USB Type-C on the new MacBook Pro, alongside a Touch ID fingerprint reader. \"Apple has tested versions of the upcoming laptops that integrate the scanner beside the new function key display,\" explains Bloomberg's Gurman. Apple is also rumored to be considering gray, gold, and silver color options for the new MacBook Pro.\nMockup of the new MacBook Pro OLED touch strip by Martin Hajek\nThe most intriguing addition to the MacBook Pro is the secondary display above the keyboard. Designed to replace the function keys, Bloomberg reports that it will be a strip-like screen that shows functions on a task-by-task basis and will simplify keyboard shortcuts. The panel could show media controls when iTunes is open, or cut and paste commands when Microsoft Word is running.\nApple has been widely criticized for still selling a four-year-old MacBook Pro model without a Retina display. Mac fans have been waiting anxiously for a MacBook Pro refresh, and the current Retina MacBook Pro is more than 440 days into its cycle, despite refreshes usually appearing every 268 days on average in the past. Apple has not yet announced an official date for its iPhone event (rumored for September 7th), and it's possible the company could now refresh its MacBook Pro line without an onstage event.",

        "body": "We're just one month out from a new iPhone release, but news of next year's model can't seem to stop seeping out. According to Bloomberg, the 2017 iPhone will no longer contain the iconic home button Apple fans have grown accustomed to over the last decade. The news pairs well with other reports of next year's iPhone, which will mark the device's 10th anniversary, using OLED display technology. That would allow the entire front of the device to \"appear like a single sheet of glass,\" according to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal in June.\nThat's not the only big change rumored for the 2017 iPhone. Nikkei Asian Review reported earlier this week that Apple may introduce a third, premium smartphone next year with a curved display not unlike Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. In fact, the report states Samsung may even be the supplier for these curved OLED displays.\nFor those wondering what will change with the upcoming iPhone 7, the device is said to remove the headphone jack in favor of the Lightning port, contain two rear cameras, and a memory boost to 3GB of RAM, according to separate report from Bloomberg. It will also contain a pressure-sensitive home button that relies on the same type of vibrating haptic feedback used in the Apple Watch and the trackpad of the new Apple MacBook.",

        "title": "Leaked \u2018iPhone 7 Plus\u2019 packaging indicates Lightning EarPods and Lightning 3.5mm headphone jack adaptor bundled in the box",
        "body": "An interesting image is making the rounds today: a photograph of a purported packaging insert for Apple\u2019s upcoming new phone. If the photo is to be believed, Apple will indeed be calling its larger new phone the \u2018iPhone 7 Plus\u2019, with the \u2018iPhone 7\u2019 name being taken by the 4.7 inch sibling.\nIt also indicates that Apple will be bundling Lightning EarPods in the box with every iPhone 7, as a consequence of the missing 3.5mm headphone jack. More interestingly, the leak suggests Apple will also be including a Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack adaptor as a bundled accessory.\nFull photo of the pamphlet after the jump \u2026\nMany were expecting Apple to make an adapter to allow customers to use existing earbuds and headphones with the new iPhone (which will not include an analogue 3.5mm jack in the hardware) but Apple\u2019s usual trend is to sell these adaptors as separate purchases.\nTaking this leaked packaging as legitimate, iPhone 7 owners will be able to connect their existing 3.5mm headphones without spending any additional money as the necessary adapter will be included in the same box as the phone itself. A pleasant change for a company with a reputation for selling pricey dongles and adaptors as extras.\nOther tidbits include the way the EarPods are described: \u2018EarPods with Lightning Connector\u2019. This suggests that the headphones themselves will be identical aside from a change of ports. Apple has trademarked the \u2018AirPods\u2019 name for wireless headphones but these will be additional accessories (pricing unknown) and not bundled. The pamphlet also shows the 256 GB storage designation mirroring previous rumors.\nThe pamphlet includes the usual legal terms you would expect to see on an Apple product sheet and appears quite convincing. Unfortunately, it is quite easy to fake an image like this so it\u2019s hard to say for sure if this is real. Packaging leaks have often turned up correct in the past with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor branding leaking out ahead of Apple\u2019s official unveiling of the iPhone 5s in 2013.\nWe\u2019ll know for sure next week, as Apple has announced a media press event for Wednesday, September 7. The company is expected to unveil its new iPhone 7 flagship lineup as well as the Apple Watch 2. New Macs are in the works but most sources are downplaying any appearance of Mac hardware at next week\u2019s presentation. 9to5Mac will be bringing live coverage of all the announces so stay tuned.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

If (show all) TNW's former West Coast writer in the PNW (Portland, Oregon). Nate loves amplifying developers, and codes in Swift when he's not writing. If you need to get in touch, Twitter is your best bet.\nAs we head into September, a lot of things in the Apple hardware ecosystem will change \u2014 and that\u2019s why buying anything to do with Apple right now is a huge mistake.\nDon\u2019t buy cases (okay, maybe one or two if you\u2019re sure about the iPhone 7). Or accessories. Definitely don\u2019t buy cables.\nWhy? USB-C.\nWith the MacBook, Apple started its slow changeover to USB-C. There\u2019s even a USB-C to Lightning cable, which I once posited (correctly, it seems) was a harbinger of things to come.\nThe new MacBook Pros, which are long overdue, are also rumored to go the USB-C route. If that\u2019s accurate, and we\u2019d have to believe it is, it changes quite a bit for the average consumer.\nAt that point, Apple is basically turning its entire ecosystem over to USB-C and Lightning. It\u2019s awesome \u2014 I\u2019m excited. But I still caution everyone not to buy anything Apple-related yet.\nApple switching to USB-C probably affects everything\nAccessory makers have also been slowly migrating to USB-C connectivity. Aukey, which makes great battery packs and other accessories (the best around, in my view), has been switching to USB-C for some time, marketing their stuff to Android device owners.\nBut that means nothing to iPhone and iPad users; Apple\u2019s own USB-C to Lightning cable is seen as a niche product for MacBook owners, but it\u2019s really the future.\nOnce Apple goes all-in on USB-C with new portable computer hardware, expect it to also change its chargers and such to USB-C \u2014 again, just like the MacBook.\nThe incoming iPhones will probably utilize USB-C to Lightning connectivity for chargers, too. From there, we should expect peripheral manufacturers to ease away (or run) from the \u2018standard\u2019 USB connection.\nThis applies to every one of us. Even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be upgrading your phone for a year or so, buying peripherals or cables is a short-term bet that just won\u2019t pay off; don\u2019t do it unless it\u2019s critical.\nThat\u2019s not to say everything will stop working once USB-C is the standard, but finding quality USB stuff will be harder.\nJust save a few bucks and bide your time\nApple is expected to announce new iPhones on September 7, and have them in stores a week or so later. If you\u2019re planning to upgrade, sit tight on accessorizing \u2014 especially when it comes to wired earbuds.\nThis is especially true if you\u2019re also planning to buy a new MacBook Pro. Unless you want to tote around a bunch of cables with disparate connection points, just chill out for a bit.\nIn six months\u2019 time, everything you want will be USB-C. Excited as we may be for what\u2019s next, remember that Apple sets the tone, and some companies need a bit of time \u2014 but once Apple makes a change, they usually scramble to catch up.",

        "title": "Apple should stop selling four-year-old computers",
        "body": "For longtime Mac users, MacRumors\u2019 Buyer\u2019s Guide is an online institution. The publication catalogs the release dates of each major Apple product line and contrasts them against the company\u2019s usually predictable timeframe for updates, ultimately delivering a verdict on whether it\u2019s better to buy now or wait. It\u2019s a hugely useful resource that I\u2019ve often pointed people to when asked for recommendations on laptop purchases.\nMacRumors lists almost every Mac as \"Don't Buy\"\nBut right now, the Mac section of the guide makes for depressing reading. Apart from the 12-inch MacBook, which was refreshed in April, every single Mac line from the mini to the Pro is designated as \"Don\u2019t Buy\" because of how long it\u2019s been since Apple updated them.\nThe Retina MacBook Pro is 442 days into its current cycle, despite refreshes coming every 268 days on average in the past. The Mac mini has gone 657 days since its last update, which was controversial in itself since Apple removed quad-core options and made the product harder to upgrade after purchase. And the Mac Pro, released in December 2013 following much \"Can\u2019t innovate any more, my ass\"-fueled fanfare? It hasn\u2019t received a single update since then. \"This is without a doubt the future of the pro desktop,\" Phil Schiller said when announcing the Mac Pro on stage that year. Did he mean that this was the precise model Apple expects professional users to use literally forever?\nApple iterates quickly and consistently in mobile because the rate of technological progress is so much more dramatic in that arena. The company does amazing work to keep its iPhones and iPads ahead of competitors, performance-wise. Simple Intel processor upgrades are less important to laptops these days, however, and I\u2019m finding this 2012 MacBook Pro fine to work from right now \u2014 faster than my 2015 MacBook, at least, which is enough for my needs.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t unconscionable for Apple to continue to sell outdated products to people who may not know any better. Is the company really saving that much money by using 2012 processors and 4GB of RAM as standard? Even an update to Intel\u2019s Haswell chips from 2013 would have brought huge battery life improvements. Apple is bound by the whims of its suppliers to a certain extent, and it may not always make sense for the company to upgrade its products with every single new chip or GPU that comes out. But there\u2019s a certain point at which it just starts to look like absentmindedness, and many Mac computers are well past that point now.\nthere\u2019s a certain point at which it just starts to look like absentmindedness\nIf Apple needs to keep the non-Retina MacBook Pro around for certain users who really need a DVD drive, fine; I happen to like the chunky old design, and it\u2019s good to have a Mac laptop in the lineup where you can still upgrade the RAM and storage. But there\u2019s no excuse for selling four-year-old hardware for $1,099. (Yes, Apple charitably dropped the price by one hundred whole dollars two years ago.) The 2012 MacBook Pro still runs okay today, but not that okay.\nThe issue pervades almost the entire Mac line. Professionals really do care about performance, so the nearly three-year wait for a new Mac Pro is exasperating to many \u2014 not least Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, who says he\u2019d like to support the Mac \"when Apple makes a good computer\" with modern GPUs. The Mac mini is similarly losing its relevance in the desktop space; I\u2019d actually like to buy one soon, but I\u2019d feel like an idiot. And it\u2019s understandable not to update the MacBook Air with a Retina display given the shift to the new MacBook, but to continually ship it with an awful TN panel? The Air\u2019s screen was subpar in 2012, which is why I got the bulkier but IPS-equipped Pro back then in the first place. Apple should be embarrassed to have it in its stores today.\nSigns point to a major MacBook Pro update coming later in the year, but nothing short of a complete overhaul for the entire Mac line will suffice. People that buy Apple products do so because they want the best; in hardware terms, at least, it\u2019s hard to argue that most people buying a Mac today will be getting that. If Apple doesn\u2019t want to keep its products reasonably current, that\u2019s its prerogative. But if that truly is the case, maybe it shouldn\u2019t sell them at all.",
