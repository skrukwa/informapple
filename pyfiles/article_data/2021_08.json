        "body": "Over the last few years, speculation about who will take over as Apple CEO following Tim Cook has started to grow. Most recently, Cook himself confirmed that he \u201cprobably\u201d won\u2019t be at Apple in 10 years\u2019 time.\nIn the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman speculates on the future of the Apple CEO position and says that the belief inside Apple is that Cook wants to stick around \u201cfor one more major new product category.\u201d\nGurman writes that Cook is particularly focused on Apple\u2019s augmented reality glasses. Apple\u2019s hardware AR/VR efforts are likely to be Cook\u2019s final major product category:\nBut there are signs that\u2019s not likely. The belief inside Apple is that Cook just wants to stick around for one more major new product category, which is likely to be augmented reality glasses rather than a car \u2014 something that\u2019s even further out. He also understands that running a Silicon Valley company is typically a young person\u2019s game, and he\u2019s not going to stay far beyond his prime.\nGurman also reiterates that Apple is planning a mixed reality headset for 2022, but that AR glasses are also in development for a release sometime in the \u201cmiddle of the decade.\u201d Gurman speculates that Cook will likely retire sometime between 2025 and 2028, as he also has a pay deal that runs out in 2025.\nBloomberg had previously detailed Apple\u2019s increasing focus on \u201csuccession planning\u201d in a report last year. That report explained that Apple is increasingly looking to \u201ccultivate its next class of top managers\u201d as Cook crosses the 10-year mark as Apple CEO.\nYou can subscribe to Gurman\u2019s excellent Power On newsletter right here. It\u2019ll hit your inbox every Sunday and is well worth a read.\nWhat do you think about the future of the Apple CEO position?

        "title": "Exclusive: Apple dropped plan for encrypting backups after FBI complained - sources",
        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O dropped plans to let iPhone users fully encrypt backups of their devices in the company's iCloud service after the FBI complained that the move would harm investigations, six sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nThe tech giant\u2019s reversal, about two years ago, has not previously been reported. It shows how much Apple has been willing to help U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies, despite taking a harder line in high-profile legal disputes with the government and casting itself as a defender of its customers\u2019 information.\nThe long-running tug of war between investigators\u2019 concerns about security and tech companies\u2019 desire for user privacy moved back into the public spotlight last week, as U.S. Attorney General William Barr took the rare step of publicly calling on Apple to unlock two iPhones used by a Saudi Air Force officer who shot dead three Americans at a Pensacola, Florida naval base last month.\nU.S. President Donald Trump piled on, accusing Apple on Twitter of refusing to unlock phones used by \u201ckillers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements.\u201d Republican and Democratic senators sounded a similar theme in a December hearing, threatening legislation against end-to-end encryption, citing unrecoverable evidence of crimes against children.\nApple did in fact did turn over the shooter\u2019s iCloud backups in the Pensacola case, and said it rejected the characterization that it \u201chas not provided substantive assistance.\u201d\nBehind the scenes, Apple has provided the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation with more sweeping help, not related to any specific probe.\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment on the company\u2019s handling of the encryption issue or any discussions it has had with the FBI. The FBI did not respond to requests for comment on any discussions with Apple.\nMore than two years ago, Apple told the FBI that it planned to offer users end-to-end encryption when storing their phone data on iCloud, according to one current and three former FBI officials and one current and one former Apple employee.\nUnder that plan, primarily designed to thwart hackers, Apple would no longer have a key to unlock the encrypted data, meaning it would not be able to turn material over to authorities in a readable form even under court order.\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\nIn private talks with Apple soon after, representatives of the FBI\u2019s cyber crime agents and its operational technology division objected to the plan, arguing it would deny them the most effective means for gaining evidence against iPhone-using suspects, the government sources said.\nWhen Apple spoke privately to the FBI about its work on phone security the following year, the end-to-end encryption plan had been dropped, according to the six sources. Reuters could not determine why exactly Apple dropped the plan.\n\u201cLegal killed it, for reasons you can imagine,\u201d another former Apple employee said he was told, without any specific mention of why the plan was dropped or if the FBI was a factor in the decision.\nThat person told Reuters the company did not want to risk being attacked by public officials for protecting criminals, sued for moving previously accessible data out of reach of government agencies or used as an excuse for new legislation against encryption.\n\u201cThey decided they weren\u2019t going to poke the bear anymore,\u201d the person said, referring to Apple\u2019s court battle with the FBI in 2016 over access to an iPhone used by one of the suspects in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.\nApple appealed a court order to break into that phone for the FBI. The government dropped the proceedings when it found a contractor that could break into the phone, a common occurrence in FBI investigations.\nTwo of the former FBI officials, who were not present in talks with Apple, told Reuters it appeared that the FBI\u2019s arguments that the backups provided vital evidence in thousands of cases had prevailed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because Apple was convinced,\u201d said one. \u201cOutside of that public spat over San Bernardino, Apple gets along with the federal government.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\nHowever, a former Apple employee said it was possible the encryption project was dropped for other reasons, such as concern that more customers would find themselves locked out of their data more often.\nOnce the decision was made, the 10 or so experts on the Apple encryption project - variously code-named Plesio and KeyDrop - were told to stop working on the effort, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nAPPLE SHIFTS FOCUS\nApple\u2019s decision not to proceed with end-to-end encryption of iCloud backups made the FBI\u2019s job easier.\nThe agency relies on hacking software that exploits security flaws to break into a phone. But that method requires direct access to the phone which would ordinarily tip off the user, who is often the subject of the investigation.\nApple\u2019s iCloud, on the other hand, can be searched in secret. In the first half of last year, the period covered by Apple\u2019s most recent semiannual transparency report on requests for data it receives from government agencies, U.S. authorities armed with regular court papers asked for and obtained full device backups or other iCloud content in 1,568 cases, covering about 6,000 accounts.\nThe company said it turned over at least some data for 90% of the requests it received. It turns over data more often in response to secret U.S. intelligence court directives, which sought content from more than 18,000 accounts in the first half of 2019, the most recently reported six-month period.\nHad it proceeded with its plan, Apple would not have been able to turn over any readable data belonging to users who opted for end-to-end encryption.\nInstead of protecting all of iCloud with end-to-end encryption, Apple has shifted to focus on protecting some of the most sensitive user information, such as saved passwords and health data.\nBut backed-up contact information and texts from iMessage, WhatsApp and other encrypted services remain available to Apple employees and authorities.\nApple is not the only tech company to have removed its own access to customers\u2019 information.\nIn October 2018, Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google announced a similar system to Apple\u2019s dropped plan for secure backups. The maker of Android software, which runs on about three-quarters of the world's mobile devices, said users could back up their data to its own cloud without trusting the company with the key.\nTwo people familiar with the project said Google gave no advance notice to governments, and picked a time to announce it when encryption was not in the news.\nThe company continues to offer the service but declined to comment on how many users have taken up the option. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment on Google\u2019s service or the agency\u2019s approach to it.",

        "title": "South Korea Passes Bill Banning Apple From Requiring Developers to Use App Store In-App Purchase System",
        "body": "South Korea today passed a bill that bans Apple and Google from requiring developers to use their own respective in-app purchasing systems, allowing developers to charge users using third-party payment methods, The Wall Street Journal reports.\nThe bill was originally supposed to be voted on yesterday, however, more urgent matters presented to South Korea's National Assembly meant the bill was postponed. The bill is an amendment to the existing Telecommunications Business Act. It aims to ban Apple and Google from unfairly exploiting their market position to \"force a provider of mobile content, etc., to use a specific payment method.\"\nApple's App Store has been under increased scrutiny in recent months. South Korea's bill represents the first time any government has taken substantive legislative steps to crack down on the platforms. Lawmakers, developers, and others have called for increased regulation of both Apple and Google's app distribution services, noting the companies' potential to engage in anti-competitive behaviors.\nUnder the now passed bill, Apple in South Korea will no longer be permitted to limit developers to only use its in-app purchasing system, which grants it a 15% to 30% commission for all purchases made. The commission has been under the spotlight ever since game developer Epic Games attempted to bypass Apple's \u200cApp Store\u200c policy by implementing a direct payment method for users last year.\nApple has called its in-app purchasing system a safe and secure way to allow users to purchase digital goods within apps, while some have called the company's commission unfair. As we noted yesterday, Apple operates its \u200cApp Store\u200c under one set of rules applied to developers internationally. While South Korea's bill is specific to users in the country, it may have a domino effect worldwide.\nBesides a 15% to 30% commission on all in-app digital purchases made, Apple charges developers a $99 annual fee to be part of its Apple Developers program. Those two revenue streams are just a few ways Apple maintains a profit for the \u200cApp Store\u200c. In the third quarter of this year, the tech giant reported an all-time high revenue record of $17.5 billion in its services business, including the \u200cApp Store\u200c.\nUpdate: In response to the bill passing, Apple has provided MacRumors with the following statement. The statement, the same one used previously when asked on the legislation, says that user trust in the \u200cApp Store\u200c will decrease as a result of the bill.",

        "title": "New U.S. Antitrust Bill Would Require Apple and Google to Allow Third-Party App Stores and Sideloading",
        "body": "New bipartisan antitrust legislation that targets Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store was today introduced by U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal, Marsha Blackburn, and Amy Klobuchar.\nThe Open App Markets Act [PDF] is meant to create \"fair, clear, and enforceable rules\" that will protect competition and strengthen consumer protections. According to the three senators, Apple and Google have \"gatekeeper control\" of the two main mobile operating systems and their app stores, allowing them to dictate the terms of the app market.\nUnder the terms of the bill, which applies to companies that own or control an \u200cApp Store\u200c with more than 50,000,000 users, Apple would not be able to require developers to use its own in-app purchase system, and it would be required to allow developers to distribute apps through alternative app stores.\nApple would need to provide \"readily accessible means\" for iPhone users to install third-party apps or app stores outside of Apple's own \u200cApp Store\u200c, and it would need to let customers choose third-party apps and app stores as their defaults while also hiding standard Apple apps.\nOther wording in the bill would prevent Apple from retaliating against developers that decided to distribute apps using alternative means, and Apple would also not be allowed to unreasonably preference its own apps. The company would need to provide developers with access to operating system interfaces, development information, and hardware and software features.\nIn a statement, Blumenthal said that the legislation would break the competitive hold that Apple and Google have over the app market while providing mobile users with more control over their devices.\n\"This legislation will tear down coercive anticompetitive walls in the app economy, giving consumers more choices and smaller startup tech companies a fighting chance. For years, Apple and Google have squashed competitors and kept consumers in the dark--pocketing hefty windfalls while acting as supposedly benevolent gatekeepers of this multi-billion dollar market. I'm proud to partner with Senators Blackburn and Klobuchar in this breakthrough blow against Big Tech bullying. This bipartisan bill will help break these tech giants' ironclad grip, open the app economy to new competitors, and give mobile users more control over their own devices.\"\nBlackburn said that Apple and Google's refusal to allow for third-party App Stores is a \"direct affront to a free and fair marketplace, and Klobuchar said that the legislation levels the playing field and will ensure an \"innovative and competitive marketplace.\"\nIn an interview with Reuters, Blumenthal said that he found the \"predatory abuse\" of the two companies \"deeply offensive on so many levels.\" He said that he expects companion legislation in the House of Representatives \"very soon.\"\nEarlier this year, U.S. lawmakers introduced sweeping antitrust legislation that would result in major changes to the tech industry if passed, with the measures coming as the culmination of a 16-month antitrust investigation.\nUpdate: In a statement to MacRumors, Apple reiterated its commitment to ensuring that apps are delivered to customers in a way that is safe and trustworthy.\n\"Since our founding, we\u2019ve always put our users at the center of everything we do, and the App Store is the cornerstone of our work to connect developers and customers in a way that is safe and trustworthy. The result has been an unprecedented engine of economic growth and innovation, one that now supports more than 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states. At Apple, our focus is on maintaining an App Store where people can have confidence that every app must meet our rigorous guidelines and their privacy and security is protected.\"",

        "title": "Apple keeps shutting down employee-run surveys on pay equity \u2014 and labor lawyers say it\u2019s illegal",
        "body": "Apple insists it does not have a problem with pay inequality. Skeptical Apple employees have been trying to verify that claim by sending out informal surveys on how much people make, particularly as it relates to women and underrepresented minorities. But the company has shut down three of those surveys, citing stringent rules on how employees can collect data. Now, multiple labor lawyers tell The Verge the company may be violating worker protections: the surveys can be considered a form of labor organizing \u2014 under US law, employees have the right to discuss pay.\n\u201cApple cannot bar its employees from discussing pay equity as it relates to protected classes,\u201d says Vincent P. White, a labor lawyer with White, Hilferty & Albanese. \u201cIf they were, they could tell people not to talk about pronouns. The logical outgrowth of that doesn\u2019t even track. I view their effort to shut this down as an act of retaliation.\u201d\nThe first known survey began in the spring and asked people to volunteer salary information in addition to how they identify in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, and disability. After about 100 responses, Apple\u2019s people team \u2014 the company\u2019s name for what is commonly called human resources \u2014 asked employees to take the survey down, saying the demographic questions constituted personally identifying information, or PII.\nLast week, employees tried to start another pay equity survey but were again told to take it down because it included a question on gender. When they created a new survey without the gender question, the Apple people team allegedly said it had to be shut down because it was hosted on the company\u2019s corporate Box account.\n\u201cThis is like a 2021 version of a foreman on the docks telling people they can\u2019t compare their wages way back in the 1800s,\u201d says White. \u201cThis isn\u2019t new. It\u2019s just the newest version of \u2018you can\u2019t talk about your pay.\u2019\u201d\nThe people team also sent employees the following information on \u201cprohibited surveys\u201d:\nProhibited Surveys\nThe following employee surveys are prohibited in all cases and may not be conducted. Surveys as Data Collection Surveys are not permitted to be used as a means of collecting identifiable employee data without following the usual process to obtain this data from the People team. This includes any questions about an employee\u2019s address, demographics, and so on, except for collecting country or region, which is permitted. Using surveys as a tool to collect health information \u2014 including but not limited to health reports, testing results, and vaccination status \u2014 is also prohibited. All requests for identifiable employee data must be submitted to the People team via the People Report Request Form. If approved, the People team will provide the employee data directly from their systems. Surveys Requesting Diversity Data\nDiversity data is highly sensitive personal data. If you have a need for such information, you must work with your I&D Business Partner and the I&D Insights and Solutions team before collecting any data.\n\u201cThose rules may themselves violate the protected right to concerted activity \u2014 while [Apple] might point to these handbook type rules that you\u2019ve agreed to not do this as a condition of employment, that doesn\u2019t mean they can legally prevent employees from doing what they\u2019re doing,\u201d says Veena Dubal, a law professor at UC Hastings.\nNow, Apple engineer Cher Scarlett has started a new survey on Typeform, which she is paying for out of pocket. \u201cI was looking at levels.fyi (a website that lets people compare salary data across companies) and noticed a few very low salaries in a certain geographic area that were 10 to 15 percent lower compared to other people on the team,\u201d Scarlett says. \u201cEvery time I looked at gender, they were women. I\u2019m not going to say that\u2019s a definitive issue, but it\u2019s a prompt for anyone to ask if this is a widespread problem. We should be able to easily find out whether or not that\u2019s the case so we can know whether people are truly being paid fairly.\u201d\nThe new survey, which has nearly 500 entries, asks employees to volunteer information on their salary, level, team, latest RSU grant, tenure at Apple, geographic location, signing bonus, relevant work experience, as well as whether they\u2019re permanently remote, and a member of an underrepresented race or gender.\n\u201cWe want our colleagues and industry peers to have the knowledge of Apple\u2019s pay bands and to give minoritized employees and prospective employees the confidence to negotiate fair wages and bonuses,\u201d the survey reads.\nGrace Reckers, an organizer with the Office and Professional Employees International Union, says the fact that this information is all voluntary should protect employees. \u201cThis is protected activity \u2014 because you\u2019re opting into the survey, I don\u2019t even know how the PII excuse would work or matter.\u201d\nScarlett says Apple\u2019s response to the surveys has only made employees more suspicious: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is going into this saying there for sure is a wage gap, whether that\u2019s gender or race or disability. But it is concerning to everyone that every single time someone tries to create more transparency, Apple shuts it down. It makes it feel like maybe there is a problem, and they\u2019re already aware of it.\u201d\nIn 2018, Apple\u2019s mean and median gender pay gap for employees in the UK was 12 percent in favor of men. That\u2019s 5 percentage points below the overall gender pay gap in the UK. The company has to publish this data under UK law, but it does not have the same requirements in the US.\nTwo years earlier, Apple CEO Tim Cook told investors that women at Apple made 99.6 cents for every dollar men made, while underrepresented minorities made 99.7 cents for every dollar white employees made. That same year, the company released a diversity report saying it had fixed the problem.",

The goal is to collect stories from workers at all levels of the organization who\u2019ve experienced harassment or discrimination.\n\u201cFor too long, Apple has evaded public scrutiny,\u201d the website reads. \u201cThe truth is that for many Apple workers ... the culture of secrecy creates an opaque, intimidating fortress. When we press for accountability and redress to the persistent injustices we witness or experience in our workplace, we are faced with a pattern of isolation, degradation, and gaslighting. No more. We\u2019ve exhausted all internal avenues. We\u2019ve talked with our leadership. We\u2019ve gone to the People team. We\u2019ve escalated through Business Conduct. Nothing has changed. It\u2019s time to Think Different.\u201d\nOnly about 15 current and former Apple employees were directly involved in the organizing effort. This morning, the organizers launched the website and Twitter account and sent the news out on a 200-person Discord server for Apple employees and contractors.\nThe effort has already gained support from organizers like Timnit Gebru, who worked at Apple prior to joining Google in 2018. After Gebru was abruptly fired from Google in December 2020, she went public about her experiences with racism and discrimination at the company. But she hasn\u2019t spoken quite so publicly about her time at Apple. Now, she tells The Verge, \u201cI experienced so many egregious things when I was at Apple, and always wondered how they manage to get out of the spotlight. I\u2019m happy to see that Apple workers are organizing. It is past time for Apple to be held accountable.\u201d\nCher Scarlett, an Apple engineer and activist who\u2019s involved in the organizing effort, posted the website in two internal Slack channels \u2014 #allies4change and #women-in-swe \u2014 this morning.",

        "body": "It\u2019s long been known that Google pays Apple a hefty sum every year to ensure that it remains the default search engine on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Now, a new report from analysts at Bernstein suggests that the payment from Google to Apple may reach $15 billion in 2021, up from $10 billion in 2020.\nIn the investor note, seen by Ped30, Bernstein analysts are estimating that Google\u2019s payment to Apple will increase to $15 billion in 2021, and to between $18 billion and $20 billion in 2022. The data is based on \u201cdisclosures in Apple\u2019s public filings as well as a bottom-up analysis of Google\u2019s TAC (traffic acquisition costs) payments.\u201d\nBernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi says that Google is likely \u201cpaying to ensure Microsoft doesn\u2019t outbid it.\u201d The analysts outline two potential risks for the Google payment to Apple, including regulatory risk and Google simply deciding the deal is no longer worth it:\nWe see two potential risks to GOOG\u2019s payments to AAPL: (1) regulatory risk, which we believe is real, but likely years away; we see a potential 4-5% impact to Apple\u2019s gross profits from an adverse ruling; & (2) that Google chooses to stop paying Apple to be the default search engine altogether, or looks to renegotiate terms and pay less. We have noted in prior research that GOOG is likely paying to ensure Microsoft doesn\u2019t outbid it. That said, with payments likely to approach $18 \u2013 $20B in FY 22, it not implausible that Google could revisit its strategy.\nApple\u2019s decision to retain Google as the default search engine on iPhone, iPad, and Mac has been met with growing criticism over the years. In an interview earlier this year, Apple\u2019s senior director of global privacy Jane Horvath offered reasoning for the deal, despite privacy concerns:\nRight now, Google is the most popular search engine. We do support Google but we also have built-in support for DuckDuckGo, and we recently also rolled out support for Ecosia.\nThe payment from Google to Apple accounts for a significant amount of Apple\u2019s ever-important Services segment. Apple has put an emphasis on Services over the years to show investors it has other ways to grow revenue and profit beyond hardware sales.\nWhat do you think of Apple\u2019s agreement with Google for the default search engine on iPhone, iPad, and Mac?

Read our ethics policy\nCredit: Apple\nApple is ramping up its efforts to encourage employees to get vaccinated against coronavirus, though it's stopping short of making shots mandatory.\nAccording to a Bloomberg report Friday, Apple has launched a new internal webpage focused on vaccinations, is hosting internal talks, and sent a memo to staffers. The webpage, for example, explains the danger of the Delta variant and how a vaccine could help stop its spread. It also emphasized recent FDA vaccine approvals.\n\"Apple is asking everyone who has access to the vaccine and is able to get vaccinated to do so as soon as you can,\" said the memo, which was sent to employees Thursday evening.\nAdditionally, Apple is giving vouchers to both employees and their dependents to get vaccinated at Walgreens drugstores as part of a partnership between the two companies. The Cupertino tech giant is also offering on-site vaccinations at Apple offices in the Bay Area and Austin, Texas.\nUnlike other Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google, Apple is not mandating that employees get vaccinated. Bloomberg reports that Apple has internally cited employee privacy as the reason why it isn't requiring staffers to get their shots.\nAlso unlike some tech companies, Apple says it will require employees to return to in-office work for at least a few days a week. However, the company has delayed the timeline for a return to the office multiple times. As it stands, Apple pushed back plans to bring employees back until January 2022.",

        "title": "Tech industry needs to rebuild user trust after privacy losses says Tim Cook",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nTech companies have eroded the trust of users in the industry, believes Apple CEO Tim Cook, with privacy becoming collateral damage from features in products that aren't thought through carefully enough.\nTim Cook is known to be outspoken when discussing privacy, referring to it repeatedly as a human right that everyone should have. In an interview published on Friday, Cook offers that it is the way that tech companies introduce new features has more of an impact on what it is used for, and whether it can harm someone's privacy.\n\"Technology doesn't want to be good. It doesn't want to be bad, it's neutral,\" Cook said in the interview with the Australian Financial Review. \"And so it's in the hands of the inventor and the user as to whether it's used for good, or not used for good.\"\nA feature's use depends on creativity, empathy, the \"passion of the people behind the technology,\" according to the CEO. \"At Apple, when we make something, we make sure that we spend an enormous amount of time thinking carefully about how it will be used.\"\nThe comments arrive at a time when Apple is under attack from critics for upcoming CSAM tools, which involves the scanning of hashes. Critics have warned it is a step towards creating a wider surveillance tool, which Apple has attempted to counter with further explanation of the system.\nIn continuing, Cook seemingly refers to Facebook, though not by name.\n\"The risk of not doing that means that technology loses touch with the user. And in that kind of case, privacy can become collateral damage,\" added Cook. \"Conspiracy theories or hate speech begins to drown everything else out. Technology will only work if it has people's trust.\"\nWhen asked if people's trust has been taken advantage of by tech firms, Cook replies \"In some cases the answer is undeniably yes. And I think it's incumbent on all of us to rebuild that trust.\"\nCook's continued pressure on Facebook involves relatively combative language for a CEO to speak, which he says is needed now because more people \"view privacy as a mainstream issue.\"\n\"Ten years ago, privacy was a niche issue,\" Cook said. \"Today it's one of the primary issues in people's minds because people know that the web has become this surveillance tool in all too many cases, and that the building of detailed profiles on people has gone well beyond any kind of reasonable thing.\"\nCompetition is good\nAs well as privacy, the interview covers the App Store and Apple's dealings with the Australian legal system. Apple's public spat with Epic Games is set to continue in Australia after the country's federal court decided on Friday to allow a lawsuit to continue in November 2022.\nMeanwhile, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission plans to introduce regulations to alter how much influence the Apple and other tech companies have in the territory.\nOn Apple's regulatory scrutiny, Cook reaffirms the belief that such examination of large companies is fair. \"I start from the premise that regulation is necessary in some areas. And so it becomes a matter of determining where it's necessary and where the focus should be.\"\n\"In our model, the user is where the power exists because it's the user who decides when they buy a phone, are they going to buy an iPhone,\" he continues. \"Are they going to buy any number of Android phones? And so it's a fiercely competitive market. And then the market inside the App Store is also fiercely competitive ... And so there's huge competition in all areas of this.\"\nWhen asked if competition is always a good thing, Cook admits \"I con't think of a case where competition is bad. I think competition is inherently good.\"\nCook confirms he is aware of the ACCC's intentions. \"Anywhere in the world that we're being inspected is on my radar, at least that we're aware of, and it's incumbent on us to tell our story and to say why we do what we do.\"\nThis also applies to Apple's fight with banks in the country, which want to get direct access to the NFC technology used in the iPhone to provide their own payment apps, rather than going through Apple Pay.\nThe response from Cook is interpreted in the interview that the banks themselves couldn't be trusted to maintain Apple's level of security.\n\"It's the reality. If you put back doors in a system, anybody can use a back door. And so you have to make sure the system itself is robust and durable; otherwise you can see what happens in the security world,\" said Cook. \"Every day you read about a breach, or you read about a ransomware.\"",

        "title": "Apple to Make Space for Larger Batteries in iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks By Adopting Slimmer Peripheral Chips",
        "body": "For future iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks, Apple plans to use smaller internal components in an effort to increase the size of the device's battery, according to DigiTimes.\nImage Credit: iFixit\nApple is expected to significantly increase the adoption of IPD (integrated passive devices) for new iPhones and other iOS products, providing robust business opportunities for manufacturing partners TSMC and Amkor, according to industry sources. Peripheral chips for iPhones, iPad and MacBook series are going slimmer with higher performance to allow more space for larger-capacity battery solutions for the devices, with the demand for IPDs to grow sharply in line with the trend, the sources said.\nSpecifically, Apple plans to \"significantly increase the adoption\" of IPDs or integrated passive devices for the peripheral chips in its products. These news chips will be slimmer in size and allow for higher performance while also taking up less internal space inside a device, allowing for larger batteries.\nThe report doesn't note when specifically these new smaller chips will debut, but it does note that Apple has approved TSMC's 6th-generation process to mass-produce IPDs for new iPhones and iPads.\nAlleged battery capacities of the upcoming iPhone 13 lineup, leaked earlier this year, signaled that the upcoming iPhones will feature larger batteries. Schematics previously seen by MacRumors also revealed that the new iPhones will be thicker, making room for the larger batteries.\nAlthough the 2021 iPhones aren't mentioned in today's report, it's reasonable to assume that new IPD chips, coupled with an increase in thickness, provide Apple with the freedom to increase battery size thanks to free internal space. The new larger batteries are rumored to be put to good use thanks to more advanced displays in the upcoming high-end iPhones.",

        "title": "Future Apple Watch band may include hydration sensor, after years of research",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nApple Watch could gain a band that measures hydration\nApple has been researching ways to have an Apple Watch band automatically track the wearer's hydration, with all the health monitoring benefits that would bring.\nApple supplier Rockley Photonics recently announced a non-invasive glucose monitoring system that so looked like it was meant for Apple Watch, that the demo units use Apple wrist bands. Practically missed in that announcement, though, was that Rockley's system is intended to monitor much more, including hydration.\nNow Apple has separately been granted a patent concerning precisely that. A patent for a hydration sensor in Apple Watch, even granted, does not mean there will ever be a product.\nHowever, as the newly-revealed \"Hydration measurement with a watch\" research says, hydration is a key health indicator. It's one that from a single type of sensor is able to contribute a great deal of information.\n\"A user's hydration level has significant impacts on the health of a user,\" says the patent. \"Dehydration can impair performance and is associated with several deleterious health consequences, including heat strokes. Overdrinking can result in hyponatremia, fatigue, confusion, coma, and even death.\"\nCurrently there are many apps for iPhone and Apple Watch which are designed to remind users to drink often, and not too much. As for actual measuring, though, the patent says that typical techniques are \"generally invasive, expensive, or unreliable.\"\n\"For example, some hydration tracking techniques involve testing fluid samples, such as urine or blood, from the user,\" it continues. \"Some techniques require analyte sensors to chemically react with sample fluids.\"\n\"Many of these sensors are disposable and limited to a single use,\" says Apple. \"Yet other techniques involve tracking the intake of fluids, expulsion of fluids (e.g., sweat, urine, etc.), and weight changes across a period of time.\"\nApple's patent is even a little dismissive of what it describes as these \"cumbersome and unreliable\" techniques. The patent's inventor, Alexander W. Williams, also points out that the lack of reliability is specifically because of \"the variety of measurements that must be manually taken.\"\nHis proposal is that Apple Watch instead perform regular, periodic measurements to calculate a user's hydration, and do so using a Watch band.\n\"A watch [band] can be positioned to receive and measure one or more electrical properties of perspiration produced by the user wearing the watch,\" says the patent. \"The measurements can be used to provide useful feedback and health tracking information to a user, thereby allowing the user to better manage hydration and overall health.\"\nApple's idea is to include electrodes for measuring the electrical properties of the perspiration.\" Those properties \"can represent a concentration of electrolytes in the perspiration, which in turn represents a hydration level of the user.\"\nDetail from the patent showing one possible position of a hydration sensor on a band\nSince this measurement is performed on perspiration, it is non-invasive and can be done repeatedly, accurately, automatically, and with minimal user intervention.\" Then the measurements can be tracked over time, \"thereby allowing the user to better manage hydration and overall health.\"",

        "body": "It\u2019s been two months since Apple previewed iOS 15, and there are still new things to get to know about the upcoming iPhone operating system. According to a Reddit user, beta 4 can auto-remove lens flares when post-processing a photo.\nThis finding was shared by the developers of the popular camera app Halide on Twitter, and as you can see in the image below, the picture was taken in a grass field with the sun appearing. Those who love taking landscape photos are used to having a minor lens flare in this kind of situation.\nThe best part is that the Reddit user only noticed that there was a lens flare when he used the Live Photo function and then discovered that on the left side of the picture there was a little flare.\nAccording to other Reddit users, they\u2019re able to confirm that the iPhone XS, iPhone 11, and iPhone 12 can post-process and remove lens flares in photos. It\u2019s still unclear whether older iPhones can do the same, as many features of iOS 15 are exclusive to phones with the A12 Bionic or newer.\nWith this feature, it\u2019s nice to see that Apple can still improve the iPhone camera while maintaining the realism of the photo.\nWith iOS 15, Apple is bringing a lot of attention to camera features on FaceTime. Portrait video (background blur) mode and voice isolation microphone adjustments are key functions coming with the upcoming iPhone operating system.\nIn Video Effects, on a FaceTime call, Portrait mode can be turned on. This isolates your face and body and applies a background blur effect to everything else in the frame, similar to taking a Portrait photo in the main Camera app.\nThere\u2019s also a new Live Text feature that lets users copy text, phone numbers, and addresses in photos taken, as you can find more about it here.\nLearn more about iOS 15 in our full roundup here.",

        "body": "Apple may be planning to launch the iPhone 13 on Friday, September 17 and third-generation AirPods on Thursday, September 30, according to an image of an e-commerce app discovered by Chinese language site IT Home.\nThe screenshot, originally posted by Weibo account @PandaIsBald, suggests all four \u200ciPhone 13\u200c models will go on sale on September 17, followed by the AirPods 3 on September 30.\nApart from the image, which could be easily faked, IT Home offers no other information to back up the claim, and the website has shared screenshots in the past that turned out to be inaccurate, so the above information should be taken with a hefty dose of salt.\nThat said, with Apple returning to its traditional September launch timeline, the above dates could easily turn out to be correct. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has suggested the iPhone will launch in the third week of September, which would be the week of September 13 to 17. Based on past launch events, September 7, September 14, and September 21 are all likely event dates where we could see the new \u200ciPhone\u200c models unveiled.\nThe new \u200ciPhone 13\u200c models will focus heavily on camera capabilities, including ProRes and portrait mode for videos. The new handsets will also include a smaller notch, larger batteries, and improved performance. Apple's third-generation AirPods are expected to have a form factor similar to the AirPods Pro, featuring a new case, a shorter stem, and perhaps replaceable ear tips.",

        "title": "Hands-on: You can now run Windows 365 on iPad, and Microsoft even has an app for it",
        "body": "Microsoft\u2019s new cloud PC system, Windows 365, has officially launched for all eligible businesses and enterprises. While it\u2019s not available to consumers yet, we hope to see it in the future. In the meantime, I was able to go hands-on with Windows 365 on my iPad Pro. Here\u2019s what my experience was like.\nGetting started\nUsing Windows 365 is incredibly easy. First and foremost, you need an eligible business or enterprise Microsoft account with an administrator. Once they\u2019ve granted you a cloud PC, you can go to windows365.microsoft.com and sign in to your account. From there, you have to let your cloud PC configure itself before launching it. But once it is ready to go, you can easily click on the cloud PC of your choice to launch Windows.\nPreviously, we expected Windows 365 to be only accessible through a web browser. I first tried Windows 365 through Safari in iPadOS 15. It wasn\u2019t a great experience, to be honest. But then I noticed Microsoft\u2019s callout to the Remote Desktop app. I flew over to the App Store and downloaded the app, entered my credentials, and boom \u2014 I had a smooth virtual install of Windows running in a native app on my iPad from the App Store. Yeah, you read that correctly.\nApple has become infamous for its rejection of game streaming apps on the App Store. It has even blocked Microsoft from shipping an Xbox cloud app. So why does Apple allow an app that lets you stream an entire operating system on the store? You could even run Xbox streamed games through your virtual Windows 365 PC on your iPad. And while the Remote Desktop is typically used for accessing a physical PC remotely, this is an entirely different ballgame. A user can set up a virtual PC through a browser and then download an app that smoothly streams Windows from Apple.\nPerformance\nWindows 10 doesn\u2019t require much horsepower to run smoothly, so running it over the web shouldn\u2019t be much of an issue. Virtual PCs in Windows 365 can be configured with different amounts of RAM, storage, and more. I tested Windows 365 in the lowest spec configuration.\nMy cloud PC had 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and 2 vCPU. It ran OK. It was usable but stuttered occasionally. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s due to my network\u2019s bandwidth or to the cloud PC\u2019s specs. Despite the occasional slowdown, apps worked exactly as you would expect them to. Microsoft\u2019s Edge web browser loaded sites quickly and was fully functional.\nApplications like Windows accessories worked like a charm. Microsoft Paint, Windows Media Player, and Notepad all worked as expected. Moving windows around was smooth and not too finicky. Some actions that have polished animations were slightly slower, like opening the Windows 10 start menu.\nApplications\nIt\u2019s really easy to get third-party applications on Windows 365. You can, of course, download any traditional Windows application from the web, but the Microsoft Store is also included. Most basic apps you\u2019ll need are there, and the store is only growing with Microsoft\u2019s less strict rules being enacted with Windows 11.\nYou can even download iTunes for Windows and run it on iPadOS through Windows 365. Apps like Spotify, Netflix, Pinterest, Affinity Photo, and more are all already on the Microsoft Store. Windows 365 cloud PCs come with Microsoft Office and Xbox applications out of the box, so you don\u2019t need to download them separately.\nExperience\niPad power users have been crying out for a way to run a traditional desktop windowed environment with a file system on their devices. Savvy users have found different ways to do so in the past. Most recently, users found a way to run Windows 3.1 on iPad through an app called iDOS. There have been other attempts in the past, like an early iPad app called OnLive that streamed a copy of Windows 7 to your iPad. But this is the first time an operating system developer has made their product directly available to users for the iPad, among other platforms.\nI was worried that the experience would be janky, but the Remote Desktop app made the experience relatively smooth and painless. The best part? The iPad\u2019s trackpad cursor turns from the circle into the traditional white arrow cursor when using Windows 365 in-app. Microsoft also provides a few shortcuts for zooming and bringing up the iPad\u2019s virtual keyboard at the top of the screen.\nThe cloud PC also holds its state, so you can multitask to other native iPad apps as you use Windows 365. You can place the Remote Desktop app in the dock to quickly jump over to Windows if you want to as well.\nConclusion + Pricing\nLong story short, Windows 365 could be the start of something very big. I know some have fears about computers that they don\u2019t actually own, but the ability to stream an entire operating system over the web from any device is huge. It still has a ways to go, I think, despite being totally usable if you need to run a Windows program on iPad.\nWindows 365 starts at $31.00/month for a single user under the basic configuration (there are some less expensive alternate options as well). There are more expensive subscriptions with more powerful cloud PCs that have more RAM and better CPUs, though. All of the business tiers of Windows 365 allow up to 300 users, while the enterprise tiers allow for unlimited users.",

The Mac mini is used for more basic tasks like video streaming, but many people use it as a software development machine, as a server or for their video editing needs. Apple knows that, so it kept the Intel model around. Well, expect that to go away in the next several months with a high-end, M1X Mac mini. It will have an updated design and more ports than the current model. Click to expand...\nApple can be expected to launch an updated high-end Mac mini with a new design and a faster \"M1X\" Apple silicon processor in the \"next several months,\"Mark Gurman reports.In the latest publication of his Power On newsletter, Gurman writes that a new high-end Mac mini, which has previously been reported to feature a new design with additional ports , can be expected to replace the current Intel Mac mini in \"the next several months.\" This presumably means the new Mac mini may launch alongside the redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros this fall. As Gurman writes:Apple leaker Jon Prosser in May shared renders of what the upcoming Mac mini may look like , and according to those renders, allegedly based on images from internal Apple sources, the new Mac mini will feature a \"plexiglass\" top and a magnetic power port. The new Mac mini is also rumored to feature additional ports.This fall, Apple is preparing to launch several new products, including the iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, a new iPad mini, an updated baseline iPad, new AirPods, and completely redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros. With Gurman's new reporting today, Apple may launch its new MacBook Pros alongside the new Mac mini at a fully focused Mac Apple silicon event.

        "title": "HBO Max to Completely Overhaul Buggy Apple TV App By End of Year",
        "body": "HBO Max will release a completely rebuilt Apple TV app by the end of the year to overcome a variety of issues users have experienced with the current version, according to a new report.\nShortly after Warnermedia removed its HBO Max offering from \u200cApple TV\u200c Channels in May, an update to its subsequently released tvOS app essentially broke several features of the service.\nIn June, HBO Max dropped the native tvOS video player in favor of a custom video player, which introduced issues with fast-forwarding and rewinding video in the app.\nRecognizing its mistake, HBO quickly reinstated the native tvOS video player UI. However, problems with playback control remained, while users have continued to report other issues to do with subtitles and audio description.\nAccording to HBO Max execs who spoke to Vulture, these remaining errors should be corrected for all \u200cApple TV\u200c users \"within days,\" while subscribers can expect the rollout of a completely new app to match the needs of the current service.\n\"We're going to replace every single connected TV app in the next four or five months,\" said an unnamed WarnerMedia exec. Apple TV customers will likely have to wait until the end of the year for the new app to appear, and an overhaul of the mobile and web-based apps is planned for early 2022.\nAccording to the report, the problems started when the company launched a new $10 ad-supported tier and expanded its app to 39 new countries in June. Integrating commercials into what had been an ad-free platform required the introduction of a whole new layer of app coding, and that's when the widely reported bugs were established.\nWarnerMedia has also admitted that the current HBO Max app wasn't built from scratch, and has been running on a retrofitted version of the old HBO Go and HBO Now services, which were designed for a very different product. Hence the decision to start afresh with a completely new app, which has been in the works since at least late last year.",

        "title": "Gurman: Apple Silicon roadmap includes new Mac Pro, Mac mini, and more by November 2022",
        "body": "When Apple first announced its plans to transition from Intel to Apple Silicon at WWDC 2020, the company said it would take around two years to fully complete the transition. Now, a new report from Bloomberg details the Apple Silicon roadmap and what to expect over the next 12 months.\nIn the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman explains that he believes Apple will \u201cbarely hit its two-year timeline\u201d for transitioning the Mac lineup fully to Apple Silicon. Thus far, we\u2019ve seen the M1 chip come to the entry-level MacBook Pro, Mac mini, MacBook Air, and 24-inch iMac. As Gurman explains, the first M1 Macs debuted in November of 2020, which gives Apple until November 2022 to complete the transition.\nLooking ahead, Gurman says that the new MacBook Pros with more \u201cM1X\u201d processors are still on track for a release in the \u201ccoming months,\u201d while a new high-end Mac mini will come \u201csoon after that.\u201d In 2022, Gurman expects that the iMac will \u201cfully transition by the end of next year\u201d and that a \u201crevamped, smaller Mac Pro with Apple Silicon\u201d is coming \u201clater next year as well.\u201d\nApple is also planning a redesigned MacBook Air for sometime in 2022, which Gurman says will include MagSafe support as well.\nGurman also reaffirms that Apple is still planning one more update to the current Intel Mac Pro, which recent rumors have suggested could be powered by the Intel Ice Lake Xeon W-3300 workstation CPUs.\nThe Apple Silicon-powered Mac Pro is expected to feature a smaller form factor, around half the size of the current Mac Pro, but with a similar design language. Bloomberg has previously reported that Apple is developing chips with 20-core and 40-core configurations for use in the smaller Mac Pro.\nWhat do you think about the roadmap ahead for Apple Silicon in the Mac? Which rumored machine are you most looking forward to seeing debut? Let us know down in the comments!",

        "title": "14-inch MacBook Pro CPU will be identical to 16-inch; price will reflect this, says leaker",
        "body": "A leaker with a good track record says that the upcoming Apple Silicon 14-inch MacBook Pro CPU will be identical to that of the 16-inch MacBook Pro.\nThis would represent a significant shift from Intel Macs, where Apple had reserved the fastest processors for the larger machines \u2026\nThe current 13-inch Intel MacBook Pro, for example, has a top-end configuration of a 2.3GHz i7 processor; Iris Plus GPU; 32GB RAM; and 4TB SSD. The 16-inch model, in contrast, maxes out at a 2.4Ghz i9 processor; Radeon Pro 5600M; 64GB RAM; and 8TB SSD.\nInitially, Twitter user Dylan said that the two machines would have the same \u201cperformance,\u201d but later clarified that he was only referring to the M1X chip, which will be full power for both models.\nHe said that the change would be welcomed by those who prefer the portability of a smaller machine, but still want the highest level of performance.\nIt\u2019s comforting to note that both MacBook Pro\u2019s that are coming this fall will have the same chip and the same performance. It\u2019s definitely a win for those who like to opt for the smaller size [\u2026] Just so that everyone understands, I am referring to the 16 and 14 inch pros both having the same M1X.\nThe addendum, then, would still leave open the possibility of different GPU and storage options, though as RAM is integrated into the CPU, it may be that the same options there would apply to both models.\nDylan warned that there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch, and that getting the same CPU as the 16-inch machine would be reflected in \u201ca notable increase in price\u201d over the current 13-inch. The existing M1 model 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,299, while the Intel version starts at $1,799. The M1X model is likely to be priced above the current Intel one.\nAll leakers have mixed track records, but Dylan was correct in his tweets about both the new M1 iMac and the 2021 iPad Pro.\nWe still don\u2019t known to expect the new machines. Bloomberg reported that we can expect them any time in the September to November timeframe. They have, however, been spotted in regulatory filings, and supply-chain sources say that production is underway.\nWe\u2019re expecting a new design, reflecting the current square-edge design language in current iPhones and iPads; a mini-LED screen; a fast SD card slot, among other new ports; and a 1080p webcam, finally.\nEven if the 14-inch MacBook Pro CPU and other specs are identical to the 16 inch, I\u2019ll still personally be opting for the larger-screen model, as I want the largest possible screen when traveling. I am, though, expecting to have to brace myself for the price!\nImage: Macworld",

        "body": "In his latest entry of the Power On newsletter, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reports that Apple\u2019s iCloud, Health, and AI teams are seeing an increase in departures.\nAccording to the report, two big names just departed from Apple: Emily Fox, in charge of Health AI research, is departing for a university position starting later this year, and Ruslan Meshenberg, who was a leader on Apple\u2019s cloud infrastructure team after serving as a Netflix VP, just left for Google.\nGurman gives two possible scenarios on why Apple is seeing so many engineerings departing:\nThe positive one: After hiring an \u201catypically high number of engineers\u201d from Netflix, Amazon, Google, and other companies, it\u2019s only natural that, eventually, with a high rate of hiring comes a high rate of departing.\nThe most pessimistic scenario is about the controversy of Apple\u2019s back-to-the-office policy that some of its employees went public to address this matter. In June, the senior VP of retail and people Deirdre O\u2019Brien said that Apple believes that \u201cin-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future.\u201d\n\u201cIf we take a moment to reflect on our unbelievable product launches this past year, the products and the launch execution were built upon the base of years of work that we did when we were all together in-person.\u201d\nWith COVID-19 cases raising again in the United States, Apple pushed back its return to the office, which could be delayed until next year, says Gurman.\nBloomberg also gives another scenario that Apple\u2019s employees may be \u201cless optimistic about their work.\u201d Apart from the iCloud+ launch, Gurman thinks Apple has \u201clarger ambitions to revamp its aging cloud infrastructure, but those changes are likely far off.\u201d\nAbout Apple\u2019s AI team, we\u2019re still waiting to see the full Siri revamp while Apple\u2019s Health team has \u201cstruggled with its own internal issues, and users are clamoring for additional Apple Watch sensors like those for blood-sugar monitoring.\u201d\nIn today\u2019s Power On newsletter, Gurman also rounded up all of the products Apple should unveil next month.

        "title": "2021 Apple Watch renders give a more realistic preview of the Series 7 design",
        "body": "New renders of the reported 2021 Apple Watch design likely give us a far better idea of what to expect from the Series 7 design than the $60 clone devices seen last week.\nWhile those looked ugly, most especially the clunky way that the screen mated with the casing, these renders look far more attractive, and are likely a much closer match for the real thing\u2026\nWhile some expressed dismay at the look of the clones, we noted at the time that they weren\u2019t likely to give much of a sense of the appearance of the real thing.\nOne of the important things to keep in mind when looking at these Apple Watch Series 7 clones is the lack of attention to detail. These are being produced based on schematics for the legitimate Apple Watch Series 7, but as Majin Bu says on Twitter, they are being sold in China for around $60. They exist primarily for case makers and to give us a look at the flat-edged design in the real world. For instance, one of the most notable things about these Apple Watch Series 7 clones is where the display meets the casing. On the current Apple Watch, this is done in a very elegant manner, such that the design is almost borderless. In these images, there is a clearer distinction between the display and the edges, but that is likely something Apple will perfect on the final design.\nPhone Arena created these more credible renders.\nFlattening the sides of the Apple Watch will make it look more consistent with the other devices in Apple\u2019s lineup and could help the watch\u2019s bezels appear thinner. This effect could be further compounded by the slightly bigger display that\u2019s rumored to come with the Apple Watch Series 7. The Apple Watch Series 7 could come in two new case sizes \u2013 41mm and 45mm. These will substitute the current 40mm and 44mm options that we\u2019ve gotten accustomed to since the Apple Watch Series 4. This 1mm difference in size may not seem like a big deal (and granted, it isn\u2019t), but it lends credibility to another rumor that we\u2019ve been hearing about the Apple Watch Series 7 \u2013 the inclusion of a bigger display.\nIn addition to the flat-sided design to match the current iPhone and iPad, we\u2019re also expecting a slightly larger screen. Increasing the sizes to 41mm and 45mm was first suggested by a Weibo user, and has since been backed by Duan Rui and Bloomberg. The latter report also indicated Apple would release new Watch faces to take advantage of the larger size.\nThis year\u2019s watches will come in 41-millimeter and 45-millimeter sizes, up from 40 and 44 millimeters. I\u2019m told that Apple will bundle multiple new watch faces to take advantage of the bigger screen, including an updated Infograph Modular face.\nI\u2019m expecting to buy one myself, perhaps a premium model for the first time.",
