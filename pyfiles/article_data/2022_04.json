        "title": "Apple realizes no one wants small phones, increases iPhone 13 orders",
        "body": "Apple reportedly increased iPhone 13 orders after coming to the realization that there\u2019s not enough demand for smaller smartphones.\nBoth iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 mini experienced \u201cdismal\u201d sales performance, according to an analyst. And Apple already cut orders for its revised iPhone SE due to weaker-than-expected demand.\nNo one wants small smartphones\nApple has long believed that smartphone users want compact devices they can use with one hand. That\u2019s why it stuck with 4-inch displays all the way up to iPhone 5s, while its rivals shipped significantly larger devices.\nBut that\u2019s not the case for the vast majority, who want displays that are large enough to comfortably play games and watch movies. They also want the other benefits that come with bigger phones, like better cameras and increased battery life.\nAnalyst John Donovan of Loop Capital says Apple finally realized there\u2019s not enough demand for compact iPhone models anymore.\nApple ramps up iPhone 13 orders\nIn a note issued to investors this week, Donovan used the \u201cdismal\u201d word to describe iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 mini sales. He said Apple is starting to see that smaller smartphones have \u201climited appeal.\u201d\nThe lack of demand \u201cis surprising to AAPL,\u201d Donovan added, but Cupertino is now \u201cpivoting\u201d to produce more iPhone 13 units to meet the much stronger demand for that model. Apple supposedly cut iPhone SE orders by around 20 million units.\n\u201cDonovan also noted that Apple has been looking at an iPhone SE Plus product\u201d for the future, said Seeking Alpha. This would allow Apple to continue offering an entry-level option while meeting the demand for larger displays.\nInvestors aren\u2019t bothered by iPhone SE\nDespite the lack of demand for iPhone SE 3 \u2014 which offers a significant improvement over its predecessor, thanks mostly to its A15 Bionic chip \u2014 Apple investors do not appear too concerned.\nApple\u2019s share price is up 12.02% over the past month. Rather than worrying about the doomed iPhone mini, investors seem more interested in what will happen with iPhone 14 later this year.",

        "body": "Apple has responded to Meta's plan to take a nearly 50% commission for digital asset purchases made inside the metaverse after complaining about fees in the App Store, calling the decision hypocritical.\nYesterday, it was revealed that Meta, more commonly known as Facebook, plans to take a steep 47.5% commission for digital asset purchases made inside the so-called \"metaverse.\"\nThe 47.5% cut includes a 30% hardware fee on top of a 17.5% platform fee. Responding to the plan, Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz told MarketWatch that Facebook is simply being hypocritical and that while it complains about Apple's own platform fees, it wants to charge creators even more.\n\u201cMeta has repeatedly taken aim at Apple for charging developers a 30% commission for in-app purchases in the App Store \u2014 and have used small businesses and creators as a scapegoat at every turn,\u201d Apple spokesman Fred Sainz stated in an email to MarketWatch. \u201cNow \u2014 Meta seeks to charge those same creators significantly more than any other platform. [Meta's] announcement lays bare Meta's hypocrisy. It goes to show that while they seek to use Apple's platform for free, they happily take from the creators and small businesses that use their own.\u201d\nFacebook and the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, have repeatedly called Apple's \u200cApp Store\u200c and the 15% to 30% cut that it takes for in-app purchases anti-competitive and monopolistic.\nZuckerberg in June 2020 said that Facebook would be making paid online events, subscriptions, badges, and other products free for creators until 2023, and after that, Meta would announce a commission that is \"less than the 30% that Apple and others take.\" That lower commission has not yet been announced, and at least in regards to the \"metaverse,\" Zuckerberg's promise for a lower cut than Apple's has already been broken.",

        "body": "Meta, better known as Facebook, plans to take a nearly 50% commission on digital asset purchases made inside the \"metaverse,\" the company has revealed, months after it had complained about the maximum 30% cut that Apple takes for purchases through the App Store.\nThis week, Meta announced new ways it's allowing creators to monetize and earn money from the \"metaverse.\" One way it's enabling that is through letting creators sell NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, through its Horizon Worlds platform. In the post, Meta declined to specify how much of a cut it would take for those purchases, but a company spokesperson told CNBC it would be 47.5% commission, inclusive of a 30% hardware fee and a 17.5% platform charge:\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed to CNBC Wednesday that Meta will take an overall cut of up to 47.5% on each transaction. That includes a \u201chardware platform fee\u201d of 30% for sales made through the Meta Quest Store, where it sells apps and games for its virtual reality headsets. On top of that, Horizon Worlds, will charge a 17.5% fee.\nMeta's vice president of Horizons, Vivek Sharma, told The Verge that the nearly 50% commission is \"a pretty competitive rate in the market,\" adding \"we believe in the other platforms being able to have their share.\"\nIronically, Meta itself, including company CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has been vocal about Apple's 15% to 30% cut from the \u200cApp Store\u200c. In June, Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook that Meta would be keeping paid online events, subscriptions, badges, and other products free for creators until 2023, and after that, Meta would announce a commission that is \"less than the 30% that Apple and others take.\"\nIn another post a few months later taking aim at Apple's policy, Zuckerberg said that the \u200cApp Store\u200c cut makes \"opportunities for creators to make money from their work\" harder. Facebook has a long history of calling Apple's \u200cApp Store\u200c and its 15% to 30% commission \"monopolistic\" and harmful to customers, adding the platform \"blocks innovation [and] blocks competition.\" Apple and Meta had a public dispute in 2020 where the Cupertino tech giant refused an update to the Facebook app that highlighted the 30% \u200cApp Store\u200c fee.\nUpdate: Apple has responded to the plan by saying it \"lays bare Meta's hypocrisy.\" Apple added that as Meta takes aim at the \u200cApp Store\u200c fees, the social media giant will \"happily take from the creators and small businesses that use their own.\"",

The display includes a plurality of pixel regions that emit light from the front surface to display a displayed image and a plurality of apertures that transmit light from the front surface to the back surface. The iPhone includes a camera disposed on a side of the back surface of the display. The camera is configured to capture images.\nThe iPhone includes a processor coupled to the display and the camera. The processor is configured to receive the captured image and apply a first digital filter to a first portion of the captured image and a second digital filter, different than the first digital filter, to a second portion of the captured image to reduce image distortion caused by the display.\nApple's patent FIG. 2 below illustrates the current iPhone Notch design and FIG. 3 illustrates a future iPhone design with the TrueDepth camera system hidden behind the back of the display imagery.\nApple's patent FIG. 4 above illustrates a future operating environment #400 wherein the camera system is behind the display imagery. Apple notes that \"although the camera #420 does not necessarily contact the display #410, the camera is closer to the back surface (#418) of the display than the front surface #417.\nApple's patent FIG. 12 below illustrates a functional block diagram of a device (#1200) including restoration optics #1220 configured to reduce image distortion caused by a display #1210.\nIn various implementations, the restoration optics include a bandpass filter #1222. For example, if the camera #1230 includes visible light sensor elements, the bandpass filter filters light to the visible wavelength range. As another example, if the camera includes infrared light sensor elements, the bandpass filter filters light to the infrared wavelength range.\nFor more details, review Apple's granted patent 11,294,422.",

        "title": "Replaceable Batteries Are Coming Back To Phones If The EU Gets Its Way",
        "body": "Back in the day, just about everything that used a battery had a hatch or a hutch that you could open to pull it out and replace it if need be. Whether it was a radio, a cordless phone, or a cellphone, it was a cinch to swap out a battery.\nThese days, many devices hide their batteries, deep beneath tamper-proof stickers and warnings that state there are \u201cno user serviceable components inside.\u201d The EU wants to change all that, though, and has voted to mandate that everything from cellphones to e-bikes must have easily replaceable batteries, with the legislation coming into effect as soon as 2024.\nBack To The Old Ways\nOnce upon a time, most batteries in common use were primary cells \u2013 single-use items that could not be recharged and were intended to be discarded after use. Naturally, this meant that appliances relying on battery power had provisions to make swapping cells out a quick and easy process.\nFast forward to the modern day. Many of our appliances, and particularly our phones, rely on rechargeable lithium batteries. Since they\u2019re rechargeable, manufacturers decided we no longer needed to replace them, and started sealing them away inside devices where they were free from the meddling fingers of the unwashed masses.\nMany reasons are commonly cited for this change in design ethos, which hit the market slowly and then all at once as smartphone manufacturers moved to premium sealed-up designs with more exotic materials. Some claim it\u2019s to provide the customer with a cleaner, fuss-free user experience, while others cite the packaging and miniaturization benefits of a device with a permanently-installed battery. It also makes it easier to waterproof a product, a feature that has been a particularly difficult design challenge on the smartphone market.\nHowever, such designs come with the drawback that if the battery does fail, the device becomes useless, and is often thrown away. While one can perform surgery on modern smartphones and other devices with dead batteries, it\u2019s a process fraught with danger for the inexperienced and can lead to damage or destruction of the device itself. And just as importantly, how do you recycle the battery if you can\u2019t remove it?\nAs part of the EU\u2019s new battery regulations, all this is set to change. The text of these regulations is one that mandates that batteries be easily removable, replaceable, and recyclable in a wide range of devices. This includes smartphones and other typical consumer appliances, as well as batteries for \u201clight means of transport\u201d such as e-bikes and e-scooters.\nBy January 1, 2024, these devices must be designed such that batteries can be safely removed and replaced using \u201cbasic and commonly available tools\u201d and \u201cwithout causing damage to the appliance or batteries.\u201d Manufacturers must also provide documentation for the removal and replacement procedure. This documentation must also be provided online for the duration of a product\u2019s expected lifetime.\nIt\u2019s a measure that could drastically change the design of all manner of technology for the EU market. All kinds of appliances use integrated, hidden batteries these days \u2013 everything from top-tier smartphones to action cameras and electric shavers. All of these products would have to be redesigned to allow batteries to be removed and replaced easily.\nOf course, it\u2019s not impossible, by any means. It was only five or so years ago that many smartphones had removable batteries as standard. It will, however, require engineers to go back to the drawing board, and perhaps make some trade-offs when it comes to slimness, materials, and style. It\u2019s a punchy move from the EU, much in the same vein as its push to standardize chargers throughout the smartphone industry. Like that legislation, this measure could be a big win for consumers tired of throwing out devices with irreplaceable batteries.\nThe EU isn\u2019t just mandating replaceability when it comes to its war on e-waste, either. It comes along with a big push towards a more \u201ccircular economy\u201d which relies more on recycling existing materials rather than relying solely on digging up new ones. Targets for collecting used portable batteries will be mandated, starting at a 45% collection rate by the end of 2023 and ramping up to 80% by the end of 2030. The law also mandates collection for all automotive, industrial, and electric vehicle batteries.\nThere\u2019s also measures to mandate sustainability in battery production. For industrial and electric vehicle batteries, starting in 2030, these batteries should use a percentage of materials from recycled batteries. 12% of cobalt, 85% of lead, 4% of lithium, and 4% of nickel used in a battery should be from recovered sources. This steps up to 20% of cobalt, 10% of lithium, 12% of nickel by 2035, with the lead fraction remaining the same as the recycling infrastructure for that metal is already in place.\nThere\u2019s a lot of good that could come from this legislation. The pressure on mining operations will be lower, and environmental impacts reduced, as recycling becomes a key part of the battery production supply chain. Additionally, there\u2019ll be less need to toss out a device suffering battery issues, with replacement straightforward and easy. The trade-off is that companies will have to work a little harder to accommodate these requirements, and some designs may suffer a minor weight or size penalty in the meantime. But if that gives us longer-lived electrical gizmos and facilitates lithium recycling, it\u2019s hard to argue against.",

        "body": "On Wednesday the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee adopted its position on the revised Radio Equipment Directive with 43 votes in favour (2 against).\nThe new rules would make sure consumers no longer need a new charger and cable every time they purchase a new device, and can use one charger for all of their small and medium-sized electronic gadgets. Mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, headphones and headsets, handheld videogame consoles and portable speakers, rechargeable via a wired cable, would have to be equipped with a USB Type-C port, regardless of the manufacturer. Exemptions would apply only for devices that are too small to have a USB Type-C port, such as smart watches, health trackers, and some sports equipment.\nThis revision is part of a broader EU effort to address product sustainability, in particular of electronics on the EU market, and to reduce electronic waste.\nClear information on charging\nMEPs also want to see clear information and labelling on new devices about charging options, as well as whether a product includes a charger. This would, they say, help to avoid confusion and ease purchasing decisions for consumers that often own several different devices and do not always need additional chargers.\nWith the growing usage of wireless charging, MEPs want the European Commission to present a strategy by the end of 2026 that allows for minimum interoperability of any new charging solutions. The goal is to avoid a new fragmentation in the market, to continue to reduce environmental waste, ensure consumer convenience and avoid so-called \u201clock-in\u201d effects created by proprietary charging solutions.\nQuote\nRapporteur Alex Agius Saliba (MT, S&D) said: \u201cWith half a billion chargers for portable devices shipped in Europe each year, generating 11,000 to 13,000 tonnes of e-waste, a single charger for mobile phones and other small and medium electronic devices would benefit everyone. It will help the environment, further help the re-use of old electronics, save money, and reduce unnecessary costs and inconvenience for both businesses and consumers. We are proposing a truly comprehensive policy intervention, building on the Commission\u2019s proposal by calling for the interoperability of wireless charging technologies by 2026 and improving information given to consumers with dedicated labels. We are also expanding the proposal\u2019s scope by adding more products, such as laptops, that will need to comply with the new rules.\u201d\nNext steps\nOnce Parliament as a whole has approved this draft negotiating position at the May plenary session, MEPs will be ready to start talks with EU governments on the final shape of the legislation.\nBackground\nParliament and its Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee have been asking for a common charger solution over the last decade, continuously calling on the Commission to act. The legislative proposal was tabled on 23 September 2021. The Council adopted its negotiating position on 26 January.",

It had been available to YouTube Premium subscribers as an experimental feature for almost a year now but, as of this weekend, it is no longer available to any users of the app looking to enable it.\nWhile Google has been notifying would-be users that \"the feature you're trying has been turned off,\" it is apparently still working for YouTube Premium subscribers who already had the feature turned on before Google shut it down.\nThat said, the YouTube PiP still works for iPhone and iPad users that previously had the test enabled. It did not disappear on one iPad we actively use PiP on, while installing the YouTube app on a new iPhone and signing into a Premium account enabled it.Premium users, however, that never tried the experiment do not have PiP today. YouTube has yet to widely roll out the capability 10 months later.\nI personally enabled the experimental picture-in-picture feature as a YouTube Premium subscriber months ago and can confirm that the feature still works per the above report.\nGoogle has already said that it plans to formally roll out picture-in-picture support to YouTube Premium subscribers as a perk. It also plans to make the feature available to all YouTube users, Premium or not, in the United States. The company has not yet stated when the roll-out will actually happen, however.\nYouTube has some catching up to do. Picture-in-picture has quickly become an expected feature for video apps on the iPhone and iPad since Apple rolled it out with iOS 14 a couple of years ago.

        "body": "It has been alleged that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro (and by extension the iPhone 14 Pro Max) will come with a Lightning connector that will be able to support USB 3.0 speeds. There had been older rumors that the iPhone 14 Pro models may have come with USB-C ports but one key factor has prevented that from happening.\n4 Reviews\nA frequent Apple product leaker has claimed that the iPhone 14 Pro will be fitted with a Lightning connector. While that news in itself would surprise no-one, it appears Apple\u2019s greatest minds are working on upgrading the transfer speed support from USB 2.0 levels to USB 3.0. If true, that would be a considerable step up for future iPhone 14 Pro owners, as USB 2.0\u2019s maximum limit of 480 mbps (or up to 60 MB/s) would make way for USB 3.0\u2019s meaty transfer rate of up to 5 gbps (or 640 MB/s).\nControversially, this claim comes from LeaksApplePro (via iDropNews), who also suggested back in November 2021 that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro would come with a USB-C port. Some defense can potentially be offered here if any of the leaker\u2019s sources stated \u201cUSB 3.0 speeds\u201d or similar, as it would be fair to presume that a comment like that implied USB-C would be onboard rather than a souped-up version of the Lightning connector.\nInterestingly, the source has offered a single reason for why Apple has stuck with Lightning connectors for the iPhone 14 smartphones: money. Cupertino can rake in oodles of cash via lucrative Lightning licensing deals to third-party accessory companies. The report states that it is currently unclear whether or not the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max will also be blessed with a Lightning connector that can transfer data at USB 3.0 speeds.\nBuy the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max on Amazon",

        "title": "Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency crackdown estimated to cost Facebook another $13 billion in 2022",
        "body": "Almost a year ago, Apple released iOS 14.5. Alongside the ability to unlock the iPhone with an Apple Watch while wearing a mask and new emojis, the company also brought its controversial App Tracking Transparency feature to life. Twelve months after, a new report indicates how ATT could impact revenue from Facebook, Twitter, Snap, and YouTube in 2022.\nAccording to a report by Lotame, big tech platforms\u2019 revenue could drop by almost $16 billion due to Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency. For those who don\u2019t remember, ATT requires that applications ask permission from users before tracking them across other apps and websites.\nFor example, when you open the Facebook app, you\u2019ll see a prompt that says the app would like to track you across other apps and services. There will be two options from which to choose: \u201cAsk App not to Track\u201d or \u201cAllow.\u201d\nTalking about Facebook, Lotame\u2019s report shows that Zuckerberg\u2019s company will take the biggest hit as the privacy changes will cost it $12.8 billion in revenue.\n\u201cThe effects of these changes on these companies are hard to isolate because all four players are still growing extremely strongly, still taking share from the last bastions of traditional media and gaining share in digital media as privacy regulations make it harder and harder for independent publishers and technologies to execute,\u201d said Mike Woosley, Chief Operating Officer at Lotame. \u201cTo add to the complexity, the pandemic has introduced volatile and unpredictable gyrations in the pacing of media spend.\u201d\nAs you can see in the data above, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube still have a massive opportunity to keep growing, although Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency will impact their revenue. It\u2019s impressive that from the $16 billion loss, Facebook will be hit with 81% of that.\n\u201cAs we move into the back half of 2022, we will no longer be talking about the impact the Identifier for Advertisers changes had on these players \u2013 by then 18 months hence,\u201d added Woosley. \u201cFirst, we may be moving into a recession. Next, there are other shocks affecting the industry. Third, we\u2019ll be thinking and talking about the next wave of changes and the likely impact on these players (cookies, IP addresses, and GAIDs). Finally, the companies themselves will be telling the market that workarounds and adaptations that they have advanced have cauterized the impact on the business.\u201d\nThe full findings can be seen here.

        "title": "After years of iteration, it's time for a fundamental rethinking of iPadOS.",
        "body": "WWDC 2022 is just over a month away and with it will come our first glimpse at the future of Apple's software across its various platforms.\nAfter a less-than-groundbreaking iPadOS 15 release last year, I'm hoping that Apple has something special up its proverbial sleeve for the iPad. Before we get the official unveiling in June, let's take a look at all the areas in which iPadOS is crying out for some attention in 2022.\nImproved multitasking views\nIpados 15 Multitasking Menu (Image credit: Adam Oram / iMore)\niPadOS 15 did address iPad multitasking, but it didn't go far enough to really revolutionize the experience of using multiple apps side-by-side.\nWhile the new multitasking controls made using Split View and Slide Over easier and more discoverable, the end user experience remained the same.\nIn iPadOS 16, I'd love to see Apple overhaul multitasking with more ways to display multiple apps on-screen at once. This could take the form of a more freeform Split View, with support for three or four apps sharing the screen, or even see Apple move to a floating window approach.\nParker Ortolani has offered the best concept I've seen so far as to how this could work without having to throw out everything good about the simplicity iPadOS offers right now.\nEnded up making a full beautiful faux webpage for my iPadOS 16 concepts last night. File is too big to post alone so I had to cut it up\u2026 check out my ideas for multitasking, the Home Screen, dock, and more\u2026 pic.twitter.com/l68denoWcKEnded up making a full beautiful faux webpage for my iPadOS 16 concepts last night. File is too big to post alone so I had to cut it up\u2026 check out my ideas for multitasking, the Home Screen, dock, and more\u2026 pic.twitter.com/l68denoWcK\u2014 Parker Ortolani (@ParkerOrtolani) April 11, 2022April 11, 2022 See more\niPad hardware, particularly that of the iPad Pro and iPad Air 5 which both run the desktop-class M1 chip, is more than powerful enough to run several apps simultaneously. Productivity on the iPad is being artificially held back by the software at this point.\nGranted, Apple has to make its iPad multitasking a touch-first experience if it is to run across all of its supported devices. That being said, multitasking is already mostly hidden away and is opted into by those that know about it and want to use it. It could get a significant redesign while remaining that type of opt-in power-user feature.\nDesktop mode\nOne thing I love about the iPad is that it becomes whatever you need it to be. Whether you want to use it as a handheld web browser, snap on a keyboard and use it as a laptop replacement, connect an Apple Pencil and use it as a drawing tablet, or pair a Bluetooth controller and play games, the iPad can do it all.\nAs MacStories editor-in-chief and noted iPad enthusiast Federico Viticci wrote a couple of years ago, the iPad is a modular computer:\n\"At its core, the iPad Pro is still a tablet; with the right additions, however, it's also become the modular computer I didn't know I needed.\"\nThis is exactly why I think iPadOS 16 needs to offer a desktop or \"pro\" mode. As Bloomberg's Mark Gurman theorized earlier this month, a special mode could be activated when the right accessories are paired, such as Apple's Magic Keyboard or Apple Pencil.\nThis could allow for more Mac-like multitasking, a more advanced Home screen experience, and even allow for an iPad to properly extend its screen to an external monitor (rather than just mirror the display as is the case now).\nAs I have written before, the people who spend laptop-like prices on an iPad and a Magic Keyboard today expect a laptop-like experience. iPadOS does not really provide one just yet.\nInteractive widgets\nIpados 15 Home Screen Hero (Image credit: Adam Oram / iMore)\nSpeaking of the Home screen, it's high time that Apple enabled interactive widgets. iPhone widgets launched with iOS 14 and came to iPad, in full, in iPadOS 15 but they aren't as functional as they could be.\nWhile widgets, in their current form, offer convenient glanceable information, they do little else. You can't, for example, check an item off your to-do list in the widget or skip a song. Instead, tapping any part of the widget opens the corresponding app, disrupting your flow.\nOn the iPad, with its plentiful Home screen real estate, it would be extremely useful to be able to set up a dashboard of glanceable info and interactive widgets for these types of quick actions.\nThe Apple Music app on Android has an interactive widget, so there is at least hope that Apple will have considered bringing the same functionality to its own OS.\nPro apps\nSwift Playgrounds 4 Ipad Pro 2021 Hero (Image credit: Joe Keller / iMore)\nIt's so long past due for Apple to bring its first-party pro apps to the iPad that it's possible it never will, but if it wants to continue to tell the pro story of the iPad then it shouldn't wait any longer.\nFor many years, Apple has pointed creative users to GarageBand and iMovie for making music and movies, but these apps are not as advanced as the pro-grade Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro that Apple makes for the Mac.\nThird-party apps have filled some of the holes Apple has left, such as Ferrite and LumaFusion, but many professional users of Apple products already use Apple's apps on their Macs and could stand to benefit from the same apps being available on the iPad.\nThe same goes for app developers. While Swift Playgrounds 4 was touted as a proper developer tool last year, rather than a purely educational app, it's still not as fully featured as Xcode is on the Mac. The iPad, particularly on the Pro end, is powerful enough for dev work, so let's see Xcode for iPad finally.\nMultiple user account support\nMultiple profiles on Apple TV (Image credit: Bryan M. Wolfe / iMore)\nPeople have been clamoring for multiple user account support on iPadOS for a long time, and I'm not sure it's ever coming. Though Apple offers the feature on macOS and on Apple TV, the company has always presented the iPhone and iPad as individual devices.\nWhile that may be true for phones, tablets are often used by multiple people in one household. As a former Apple Genius, I have seen the havoc this can wreak on a person's Apple ID or personal privacy.\nMultiple account support would be one way that iPadOS could differentiate from iOS, further justifying the name change, while offering more \"proper computer\"-like functionality. With Family Sharing, Apple could make it really simple to set up, too.\nThat being said, if a family can all use one iPad, Apple risks selling only one iPad to that family which is likely why this feature has yet to, and may never, appear.\nHomeKit hub mode\nIpad Mini 6 Review Home Hub (Image credit: Adam Oram / iMore)\nThis is perhaps a niche feature, but one that I would personally love to see in iPadOS 16: a HomeKit hub mode for iPad.\nIn my home, I have repurposed an old iPad model and turned it into a dedicated HomeKit device by keeping it permanently docked and locked to the Home app via Guided Access. It gives me easy access to my HomeKit accessory controls and is often easier to use on the way out of the door instead of barking Siri commands or fiddling with my phone.\nWe've seen a lot of dedicated smart displays crop up in recent years for the Alexa and Google Assistant ecosystems, but the only way to replicate it thus far for HomeKit is with something like I have set up.\nThe problem is, it's a bit of a hacky solution and requires having a spare iPad laying around to do. The Home app is also very information-dense and not all that glanceable. What I propose is an optional mode that the iPad can default to when left docked that shows pertinent HomeKit-related information on the screen.\nAmazon does something very similar with Show Mode for its Fire 8 HD Plus and charging dock. With its famed hardware and software integration, Apple could shamelessly crib this idea, sprinkling in some Apple design sense to make it functional and good looking, and even make some money on a first-party docking solution if it wanted to.\nHopefully not more of the same\nWith WWDC 2022 just over a month away, we have some hopes for the unveiling of the new iPadOS 16. Ever since Apple spun iPadOS out of iOS, we've only really seen iterative updates to the tablet-specific OS.\nAfter a less-than-exciting iPadOS 14 cycle that focused more on refinement, and an iPadOS 15 release that improved some foundational experiences without reinventing the wheel, it's time for a fundamental rethinking of iPadOS with version 16.",

In a screenshotted email sent to affected developers, titled \u201cApp Improvement Notice,\u201d Apple warns it will remove apps from the App Store that haven\u2019t been \u201cupdated in a significant amount of time\u201d and gives developers just 30 days to update them.\n\u201cYou can keep this app available for new users to discover and download from the App Store by submitting an update for review in 30 days,\u201d Apple writes in the email. \u201cIf no update is submitted in 30 days, the app will be removed from sale.\u201d While Apple will remove the outdated apps from the App Store, any previously downloaded apps will remain on users\u2019 devices.\nA number of app makers, like Protopop Games developer Robert Kabwe, have expressed their concerns about the change. Kabwe says on Twitter that Apple is threatening to remove his fully-functional game, Motivoto, because it hasn\u2019t been updated since March 2019.\nMeanwhile, Kosta Eleftheriou, the developer of the FlickType Apple Watch keyboard, says Apple took down a version of his app made specifically for the visually impaired because it hasn't been updated in two years. As Eleftheriou points out in his tweet, the once-super-popular Pocket God app still remains on the App Store even though it received its last update in 2015. Developer Emilia Lazer-Walker also reported that Apple is removing \u201ca few\u201d of her older games from the App Store. Several other developers share the same experience, noting that they just haven\u2019t had the time to update their apps.\nOn Apple\u2019s App Store Improvements page, the company says: \u201cWe are implementing an ongoing process of evaluating apps, removing apps that no longer function as intended, don\u2019t follow current review guidelines, or are outdated.\u201d There isn\u2019t a time stamp on the page, so it\u2019s not immediately clear when Apple published or last updated the post. Apple didn't immediately respond to The Verge\u2019s request for comment.\nIn 2016, Apple said it would start removing abandoned apps from the App Store. At the time, it also warned developers that they would have 30 days to update their app before it got taken down. That said, it\u2019s unclear whether Apple has continuously been enforcing this rule over the years, or if it recently started conducting a wider sweep. Apple also doesn\u2019t clearly outline what it considers to be \u201coutdated\u201d \u2014 whether it's based on the time that has elapsed since an app was last updated, or if it concerns compatibility with the most recent version of iOS.\nCritics of this policy argue that mobile apps should remain available no matter their age, much like old video games remain playable on consoles. Others say the policy is unnecessarily tough on developers, and claim Apple doesn\u2019t fully respect the work that goes into indie games.",

        "body": "Apple's upcoming iPhone 14 Pro models are widely rumored to feature new displays with a pill-shaped cutout and a hole for the Face ID sensors and front camera, respectively, and now a real-world look at this design has seemingly surfaced.\nFront glass panels for all four iPhone 14 models have allegedly surfaced on Chinese social media website Weibo, as shared on Twitter by @SaranByte and reported by 9to5Mac. The panels reveal not only the rumored pill-and-hole design for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, but also slightly thinner bezels and a taller aspect ratio for those models.\nAs expected, the image also shows that the standard iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max models will retain the same notch as iPhone 13 models.\nWhile it is unclear if the image is legitimate, the front glass panels line up with all rumors that we have heard about iPhone 14 models so far, and similar leaks have occurred in the past. Last year, for example, MacRumors exclusively shared an image of front glass panels for all iPhone 13 models that proved to be accurate.\nThe pill-and-hole design for iPhone 14 Pro models has been reported by sources including display industry consultant Ross Young and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Other rumored iPhone 14 Pro features include a 48-megapixel rear camera, an upgraded front camera with autofocus, and more, with full details available in our iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro roundups.",

Discover is one of the smaller card networks and is accepted in far fewer places than heavyweights Visa and Mastercard.\nOver the past few days, several Apple Cash virtual card images on Apple's website have been swapped out for new ones displaying a Visa debit logo, and the transition to the more widely accepted network appears to be underway.\nIt's unclear whether Apple will be imminently transitioning existing Discover-based Apple Cash accounts to the Visa network, but in our testing it appears that new Apple Cash accounts are now being created with Visa.\nIf you currently have a Discover Apple Cash account, deactivating Apple Cash in Settings on your device and then reactivating it will generate a new Apple Cash Device Account Number on the Visa network.\nDistinct from the Apple Card credit card, Apple Cash is similar to a debit card (though without a physical card) and allows users to easily send and receive money via \u200cApple Pay\u200c and the Messages app. Users can keep funds stored in Apple Cash for easy access, link it to a bank account or other debit card to pull money out, or use the funds to pay off \u200cApple Card\u200c balances. \u200cApple Card\u200c cash back earnings are also paid out as Apple Cash.",

The puck also senses your water consumption, transmitting the data via Bluetooth to your phone and on to Apple Health.\nThe vacuum-insulated bottle can keep liquids cold for up to 24 hours, and the bottle and lid are BPA free and dishwasher-safe while the rechargeable LED puck should be cleaned with a damp cloth.\nFor a cheaper and lighter option, the 24-ounce HidrateSpark PRO Smart Water Bottle priced at $60 is available in green or black and is made of shatter- and odor-resistant Tritan plastic rather than vacuum-insulated steel. It includes the same LED sensor puck as on the more expensive model and similarly comes with both chug and straw lids and is BPA-free.\nThe two new bottles join two other HidrateSpark models that were already available through Apple, the 21-ounce HidrateSpark STEEL priced at $70 and the 20-ounce Hidrate Spark 3 priced at $60.",

        "title": "Five Years Ago Today, Apple's Uncharacteristic Apology Set the Stage for the Mac's Renaissance",
        "body": "Five years ago, the Mac lineup was in a bad state. Over three years had passed since Apple redesigned the Mac Pro with a sleek but constrained \"trash can\" enclosure, while the iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac mini had also gone years without updates.\nA snapshot of the MacRumors Buyer's Guide from April 4, 2017:\nAt the time, some users began to question whether Apple was still committed to the Mac, especially at the high end of the market.\nThe criticism ultimately led Apple to hold a meeting with a small group of reporters, where it apologized to pro Mac users and ensured that it remained committed to the Mac. In a rare and surprising move, Apple also pre-announced it was working on a \"completely rethought\" Mac Pro with a modular design, a new pro-level iMac, and a new pro display.\nThe meeting, which was disclosed to the public five years ago today, involved Apple's former marketing chief Phil Schiller, software engineering chief Craig Federighi, and then-VP, now-SVP of hardware engineering John Ternus. One of the reporters in the room was John Gruber, and the quotes that follow are from his Daring Fireball coverage.\nSchiller's apology to Mac Pro users:\nThe current Mac Pro, as we've said a few times, was constrained thermally and it restricted our ability to upgrade it. And for that, we're sorry to disappoint customers who wanted that, and we've asked the team to go and re-architect and design something great for the future that those Mac Pro customers who want more expandability, more upgradability in the future. It'll meet more of those needs.\nFederighi's admission that Apple had designed itself into a \"thermal corner\":\nI think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will. We designed a system with the kind of GPUs that at the time we thought we needed, and that we thought we could well serve with a two GPU architecture. That that was the thermal limit we needed, or the thermal capacity we needed. But workloads didn\u2019t materialize to fit that as broadly as we hoped.\nSchiller ensuring that Apple remains committed to the Mac:\nWe're committed to the Mac, we've got great talent on the Mac, both hardware and software, we've got great products planned for the future, and as far as our horizon line can see, the Mac is a core component of the things Apple delivers, including to our pro customers.\nTo say that Apple delivered on its promise is an understatement. Not only did Apple release the modular Mac Pro and the since-discontinued iMac Pro, but it also finally ditched the problematic butterfly keyboard on MacBooks, announced its game-changing transition to Apple silicon, brought back a wide array of ports on the latest MacBook Pro models, gave customers an entirely new option in the Mac Studio, and more.\nApple's roundtable discussion with reporters will forever be a turning point in the Mac's history.",

Over time more services were added, and the name and icon evolved along with it. Eventually it became an iOS app named \"Delivery Status touch\" on September 19, 2008, shortly after Apple first launched the App Store. When I first created the widget I never imagined I'd still be working on it daily sixteen years later.\nPiontek says that sadly, \"we're no longer able to maintain the same service that so many of you have come to rely on,\" stating that Deliveries relies on lots of different shipping companies for its information and that it's not possible to keep the app working without their help.\nGoing forward, the developer says users will see more and more companies no longer showing tracking information directly in the app, with missing delivery dates, map routes, and other details, as well as an end to notifications about status changes. The only real option users will have is the 'view online' button which will just take them to the company's website.\nIn resignation, Junecloud says that it understands the change will make the app less useful and that customers \"may decide to take a different approach to tracking your packages.\" It did however say it would continue to try and make the app as useful as possible for those who want to keep using it.",

It previously helped McDonald\u2019s avoid responsibility in a 2014 case that alleged the company, as a joint employer, violated labor laws by retaliating against workers who participated in the Fight for $15 campaign.\n\u201cFrom the start I\u2019ve thought unionization was a good thing,\u201d said one current retail employee who asked to remain anonymous as they are not authorized to speak publicly about the company. \u201cPay is so unequal at the stores \u2014 there are people who\u2019ve been in roles for less time making more than people who\u2019ve worked in those same roles for years. They position themselves as a company that\u2019s open to feedback but nobody acts on it. With a union backing the employees, they\u2019ll be more pressure on them to actually act on it.\u201d\nLast week, Apple retail workers at the Cumberland Mall in Atlanta filed for a union election. The employees are unionizing with the Communications Workers of America. The move set off a firestorm of organizing activity at Apple Stores across the country.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re panicking.\u201d\n\u201cBy retaining the notorious union busting firm Littler Mendelson, Apple\u2019s management is showing that they intend to try to prevent their employees from exercising their right to join a union by running the same playbook as other large corporations,\u201d said CWA Secretary-Treasurer Sara Steffens. \u201cThe workers at Starbucks, another Littler client, aren\u2019t falling for it and neither will the workers at Apple.\u201d\nLittler is open about its tactics to help companies avoid unions. In a handbook on worker organizing obtained by The Verge, the firm instructs companies on what they can and cannot do to dissuade workers from organizing, including telling employees to vote \u201cno\u201d and prohibiting the distribution of pro-union literature if it creates a \u201clitter problem\u201d when pamphlets are not thrown away correctly.\nThe handbook explains that companies can ban union organizing during work hours. \u201cAlthough working time is defined by the [National Labor Relations] Board to exclude meal and break periods, it is not necessary to specifically include this definition in a written policy so long as the term working time is used,\u201d it reads.\nOne worker at an Apple store in New York said the company has held captive audience meetings \u2014 a tactic commonly used to spread anti-union messaging during work hours. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation that\u2019s been spread trying to scare the masses,\u201d the worker, who asked to remain anonymous to protect their job security, said. \u201cI think they\u2019re panicking.\u201d\nThe union fight comes after a difficult two years for retail staff who\u2019ve had to contend with COVID-19 outbreaks and mental health crises exacerbated by heavy workloads.\nLittler also helps companies identify union activity. A handbook section on \u201crecognizing subtle signs of union activity,\u201d reads, \u201cA considerable increase in the number of employee group conversations and the tendency for discussions to stop suddenly when a supervisor approaches may indicate that a union drive is in progress.\u201d It adds, \u201cEvery work location has one or more employees who command the respect and trust of their coworkers. When those dynamics suddenly change and a new leader appears, he or she may be the primary union organizer in the company. The new leader may be the one who made the first union contact, or perhaps someone the union planted in the facility to organize the employees.\u201d",

        "body": "Teardown of Apple's new & long Thunderbolt 4 Pro Cable highlights why it's so expensive\nIf you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nImage Credit: ChargerLAB\nA new video takes a look inside Apple's newly introduced Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable and gives viewers a look at the premium components that went into its design.\nWhen Apple introduced the Mac Studio and Studio Display in March, they quietly launched a new Thunderbolt 4 Pro Cable. The new cable, priced at $129 for the 1.8-meter length, is capable of up to 40Gb/s data transfer and allows for charging up to 100W.\nA new teardown video by ChargerLAB highlights the premium materials and construction that went into making the cable.\nThe cable is a coaxial cable that features 19 wires. Six of the wires are tinned copper wires that supply power. In addition, two wires enable USB 2.0 transmission, making the cable backward compatible with Thunderbolt 3, USB 3, and USB2. Many of the wires are plated with silver as well as copper.\nThe connectors themselves also feature premium parts contained in a durable brass housing. Each connector also features 24 gold-plated pins.\nInside the connector is an Intel chip used for signal reconstruction and reducing signal jitter. The outside of the cable is encased in a waterproof and dustproof braided exterior, increasing the cable's durability.\nChargerLAB notes that the cable performs very well but is likely not useful for standard customers who would fare just as well with a cheaper alternative. Functional 1.8M Thunderbolt 4 cables can be found for as low as $40, albeit minus some of Apple's design and material touches.\nHowever, for creatives working with large amounts of data, ChargerLAB states it may be the best option currently available.",
