        "title": "Apple unveils the new 4-inch 'iPhone SE'",
        "body": "The \u201ciPhone SE\u201d is now official as Apple today unveiled the device on stage at its \u2018Let us loop you in\u2019 press event in Cupertino.\nThe new iPhone SE\u2019s major upgrades include Apple\u2019s A9 chip and M9 motion coprocessor, since the design is mostly identical to the iPhone 5s apart from the new rose gold color as expected. Apple noted that the upgraded internals give the iPhone SE the same graphics and processing performance as the iPhone 6S.\nThe other big upgrade for the iPhone SE, as expected, is a new 4K-capable 12MP iSight camera with Retina Flash, Focus Pixels, True Tone Flash, and a new image signal processor. That gives the device support for 4k video, 1080p at up to 60fps, slo-mo up to 240 fps, and Panoramas up to 63MP.\nOther new specs in the iPhone SE include faster LTE, voice over LTE support, Wi-Fi calling, Bluetooth 4.2, and improved battery life over the iPhone 5s. You\u2019ll also now get support for Live Photos and always-on \u201cHey Siri\u201d.\nAnd the device has new microphones as well as an NFC chip, which means Apple Pay will be supported unlike with previous 4-inch iPhones.\nThe much anticipated 4-inch iPhone marks a few firsts for Apple as it introduces the smaller, less expensive iPhone as a rare mid-year iPhone update ahead of what most expect will be the next-generation iPhone 7 launch in the fall later this year. The device comes as an upgrade to the aging iPhone 5S, Apple\u2019s last device to include the 4-inch display size before it upgraded to 4.7 and 5.5-inch displays for the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, and later generations.\nApple made a point of noting why it\u2019s introducing the new device, pointing out that it sold around 30 million 4-inch iPhones last year and the fact that there are many users that appreciated the 5s for being either smaller or less expensive. Earlier today we noted that based on data of active iPhone users, the market for a 4-inch device could be as high as almost one third of total users or 36%.\nAnd the iPhone SE will be Apple\u2019s least expensive new iPhone yet starting at just $399 or free on contract with carriers.

        "title": "FBI warns that car hacking is a real risk - so why the hell would we want backdoors made for hackers?",
        "body": "It's been eight months since a pair of security researchers proved beyond any doubt that car hacking is more than an action movie plot device when they remotely killed the transmission of a 2014 Jeep Cherokee as I drove it down a St. Louis highway. Now the FBI has caught up with that news, and it's warning Americans to take the risk of vehicular cybersabotage seriously.\nIn a public service announcement issued together with the Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, the FBI on Thursday released a warning to drivers about the threat of over-the-internet attacks on cars and trucks. The announcement doesn't reveal any sign that the agencies have learned about incidents of car hacking that weren't already public. But it cites all of last year's car hacking research to offer a list of tips about how to keep vehicles secure from hackers and recommendations about what to do if you believe your car has been hacked---including a request to notify the FBI.\n\"Modern motor vehicles often include new connected vehicle technologies that aim to provide benefits such as added safety features, improved fuel economy, and greater overall convenience,\" the PSA reads. \"Aftermarket devices are also providing consumers with new features to monitor the status of their vehicles. However, with this increased connectivity, it is important that consumers and manufacturers maintain awareness of potential cyber security threats.\"\nThe FBI and DOT's advice includes keeping automotive software up to date and staying aware of any possible recalls that require manual security patches to your car's code, as well as avoiding any unauthorized changes to a vehicle's software and being careful about plugging insecure gadgets into the car's network. Most of those tips stem directly from last year's research demonstrations: After hackers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek hacked the Jeep in July, Chrysler issued a 1.4 million vehicle recall and mailed USB drives with software updates to affected drivers. And the next month, researchers from the University of California at San Diego showed that a common insurance dongle plugged into a Corvette's dashboard could be hacked to turn on the car's windshield wipers or disable its brakes.\nThe announcement also notes that drivers should be careful about offering physical access to their vehicles to strangers. \"In much the same way as you would not leave your personal computer or smartphone unlocked, in an unsecure location, or with someone you don\u2019t trust, it is important that you maintain awareness of those who may have access to your vehicle,\" the announcement reads. (If only the FBI felt quite so strongly about keeping intruders out of your iPhone.)\nNot much in the FBI's warning is new information, says Chris Valasek, one of the two Jeep-hacking researchers. But he says the imprimatur of the FBI could make the threat of car hacking real for anyone who hasn't considered the growing risk of digital attacks on connected vehicles. \"It seems super delayed,\" says Valasek. \"But it's good advice...people take the FBI seriously.\"\nValasek says the most significant part of the announcement may be its request that anyone who suspects their car has been hacked to get in contact with the FBI, along with the car manufacturer and the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration. Until now, Valasek says, he and his fellow Jeep hacker Charlie Miller have themselves been bombarded with messages---credible and not-so-credible---from people who believe they're car hacking victims. \"Charlie and I get emails all the time from people who say 'my car's been hacked!'\" he says. \"The FBI is more than welcome to take that over.\"",

        "title": "Official: Justice Department to withdraw legal action against Apple",
        "body": "FBI hacks into terrorist\u2019s iPhone without Apple\nShow Caption Hide Caption The FBI is dropping the San Bernardino iPhone court case Thanks to the skills of an unknown third party, the Department of Justice was able to access data on the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters.Video provided by Newsy Newslook\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Although the government officially withdrew from its battle against Apple Monday, many observers sense the tech privacy war is just getting started.\n\"This lawsuit may be over, but the Constitutional and privacy questions it raised are not,\" Congressman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who had criticized the Justice Department's legal effort against Apple, said in a statement Monday.\nThe Justice Department withdrew its legal action against Apple after a method brought to the FBI earlier this month by an unidentified entity allowed investigators to crack the security function without erasing contents of the iPhone used by Syed Farook, who with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the December mass shooting in San Bernardino that left 14 dead.\nThe government maintained it was looking for access to one phone, but Apple countered that asking for a code that could access the iPhone 5c would create a backdoor to all such devices that was exploitable by other entities.\n\"This case should never have been brought,\" Apple said in a statement released late Monday. \"We will continue to help law enforcement with their investigations, as we have done all along, and we will continue to increase the security of our products as the threats and attacks on our data become more frequent and more sophisticated. ... This case raised issues which deserve a national conversation about our civil liberties, and our collective security and privacy.\"\nIn its two-page filing in a California magistrate's court, the government noted that due to outside assistance it \"no longer requires the assistance from Apple Inc.\" Justice spokeswoman Melanie Newman said the FBI is reviewing the contents of the phone as \"consistent with standard investigatory procedures,\" and that \"we will continue to pursue all available options for this mission, including seeking the cooperation of manufacturers and relying upon the creativity of both the public and private sectors.\"\nGovernment law enforcement officials have denied charges the FBI wanted to establish a backdoor to Apple's encryption, and swatted away accusations that they were using the case to gain broader access to consumers' devices.\n\"The San Bernardino case was not about trying to send a message or set a precedent; it was and is about fully investigating a terrorist attack,'' FBI Director James Comey wrote in an editorial last week.\nThe FBI has about a dozen similar cases pending in which it wants access to smartphone information to assist with a case. So while this particular showdown may be over, \"there are other cases pending where law enforcement relies on the All Writs Act\" to access tech gadget data, referring to an old law that can compel companies to help the government in pursuit of its duties, says Denelle Dixon-Thayer, Chief Legal and Business Officer at Mozilla, the company behind the Firefox browser.\n\"This question is clearly not going away just because the government has withdrawn their request in this particular case,\" she says.\nMozilla and dozens of other tech companies that supported Apple with amicus briefs will be watching what happens next carefully.\nPrivacy issues have both societal and financial implications. Given the ubiquity of smartphones and tablets, concerns loom about how rogue regimes could leverage back doors into tech products to go after detractors. Companies like Apple, whose brand identity is anchored to data security, could face declining sales if smartphones and tablets prove hackable.\nAll that is counterbalanced by the need for public security in an age when terrorists use encrypted smartphone communication to secretly plot devastating attacks such as the recent suicide missions in Brussels and Paris.\nJustice officials declined to comment on whether the technique used to unlock the phone would be applied to other encrypted devices. Authorities also refused comment on whether the method would be shared with Apple.\nApple officials said on a call with reporters last week that if the iPhone in question was accessed, the company would want to know how so it can improve its encryption techniques. Declining to turn over such details to Apple engineers would \"leave ordinary users at risk from malicious third-parties who also may use the vulnerability,\" says Andrew Crocker, staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nMonday's action concludes six weeks of building tensions between the government and the the Silicon Valley i-product giant. The FBI insisted for weeks that only Apple could crack the contents of Farook's iPhone. Apple said such an action amounted to a digital \"backdoor\" that could eventually undermine the privacy of consumers \u2014 an unwavering stance supported by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and other tech giants.\nThe foes were poised to face off in a court room in Riverside, Calif., last week before the Justice Department abruptly asked for \u2014 and was granted \u2014 a postponement.\nApple CEO Tim Cook has crusaded in a highly coordinated public campaign against the dangers of weakened security in digital devices. This month, Apple said the \u201cFounding Fathers would be appalled\u201d because the government\u2019s order to unlock the iPhone was based on what it said was non-existent authority asserted by the DOJ.\nCalifornia U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said federal authorities had pursued the litigation to \u201cfulfill a solemn commitment to the victims of the San Bernardino shooting \u2014 that we will not rest until we have fully pursued every investigative lead related to the vicious attack.\u2019\u2019\nAlex Abdo, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, called the government\u2019s \u201cunprecedented power-grab\u201d a threat to everyone\u2019s security and privacy.\n\u201cUnfortunately, (Monday's) news appears to be just a delay of an inevitable fight over whether the FBI can force Apple to undermine the security of its own products,\u201d Abdo said in a statement late Monday. \u201cWe would all be more secure if the government ended this reckless effort.\u201d\nMarco della Cava and Jon Swartz reported from San Francisco, Johnson from Washington, D.C.",

        "body": "If Apple doesn\u2019t comply with the court order requiring it to weaken the security on the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone, it may be asked to hand over the source code to the entire operating system instead, the Department of Justice has implied.\nIn its formal legal rebuttal to Apple, the department addressed one of Apple\u2019s key legal arguments: that forcing it to write the code, which would remove key security features from Syed Farook\u2019s iPhone would be unduly burdensome.\nThe department wrote in a footnote to its filing: \u201cThe FBI cannot itself modify the software on Farook\u2019s iPhone without access to the source code and Apple\u2019s private electronic signature.\n\u201cThe government did not seek to compel Apple to turn those over because it believed such a request would be less palatable to Apple. If Apple would prefer that course, however, that may provide an alternative that requires less labour by Apple programmers.\u201d\nSuch an order would not be unprecedented. In August 2013, Lavabit, the secure email service used by NSA leaker Edward Snowden, abruptly shut down citing government interference. It later emerged that the FBI had attempted to force the site\u2019s owner, Ladar Levison, to hand over the encryption keys for his email service so that they could monitor any emails sent by Snowden. Levison refused and was sanctioned for contempt of court as a result.\nIn its filing regarding Apple, the US government cited the precedent set by Lavabit.\nPossession of Apple\u2019s private key wouldn\u2019t just allow the FBI to modify Farook\u2019s iPhone. It would also make it possible for the organisation to write new versions of iOS in future cases, and deliver them in other ways. For instance, if the FBI were able to intercept the net connection of a target (known as a \u201cman in the middle\u201d attack), with Apple\u2019s private key it could plausibly push an update that looked like a real software release from the company.",

        "body": "John McAfee isn\u2019t telling you the truth\u2014but he says he\u2019s lying for a good cause.\nMcAfee has been on a media tour discussing a court order that directs Apple to write custom code to help the FBI access a terrorist\u2019s iPhone. The method McAfee says he would use to break open the phone, he admitted to the Daily Dot, is false.\nMcAfee, who founded of one of the first companies to offer antivirus software, claimed on CNN and Russia Today, as well as in a Business Insider column, that he could bypass the advanced encryption protecting the iPhone without Apple\u2019s help. But he lied in those interviews, he told the Daily Dot, to \u201cget a shitload of public attention.\u201d\nFurther, the method McAfee says is real\u2014the one he says he\u2019s lying to try to hide\u2014is neither a secret nor feasible for anyone to accomplish without expensive tools and specialized skills. Even then, experts believe it would be difficult and would risk destroying the data the FBI is fighting so hard to access.\n\u201cNow, what I did not lie about was my ability to crack the iPhone. I can do it. It\u2019s a piece of friggin\u2019 cake.\u201d\nApple has the ability to write custom software that would allow the FBI to brute force its way into San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook\u2019s iPhone without triggering a self-destruct security feature. But it must do so by authorizing the specialized version of iOS with a signature Apple exclusively holds.\nFBI Director James Comey said during a congressional hearing on Tuesday that his office had requested the help of the entire U.S. government but that he did not find a viable solution for breaking into the iPhone without demanding Apple\u2019s assistance.\nMcAfee said he bent the truth in order to push back against the official narrative.\n\u201cBy doing so, I knew that I would get a shitload of public attention, which I did,\u201d McAfee said. \u201cThat video, on my YouTube account, it has 700,000 views. My point is to bring to the American public the problem that the FBI is trying to [fool] the American public. How am I going to do that, by just going off and saying it? No one is going to listen to that crap.\n\u201cSo I come up with something sensational,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, what I did not lie about was my ability to crack the iPhone. I can do it. It\u2019s a piece of friggin\u2019 cake. You could probably do it.\u201d\nMcAfee first admitted to lying in an interview with Inverse.The software company executive offered to tell the Daily Dot his secret method for cracking an encrypted iPhone, something that experts say cannot be done without Apple\u2019s authentic digital signature, but only if the Daily Dot promised to \u201cnot publish this publicly or tell anybody else.\u201d\nThe Daily Dot declined to make such a promise in order to keep the entire conversation on the record.\nLater in the interview, McAfee described his method, which involves \u201cdecapping\u201d the phone\u2019s processor and acquiring the device\u2019s unique identifier (UID), that may allow someone to brute force the phone\u2019s password\u2014guess the password by flooding it with options\u2014at a faster rate. Despite his insistence that the Daily Dot not publish this technique, McAfee has explained the method in previous media interviews.\nSome experts believe, however, that McAfee\u2019s theory doesn\u2019t make much sense. Ars Technica explained why:\nThus far, the most plausible method for decrypting the San Bernardino iPhone without Apple\u2019s assistance involves manually inspecting the handset\u2019s processor using acid and lasers. Done correctly, this would let the FBI learn not the PIN, but the device\u2019s unique hardware ID. With that ID, they could combine it with each of the PINs in turn until they hit upon the right one. The cost and complexity of this technique would be extremely high, and it would be extremely risky: one wrong move and the hardware ID would be destroyed permanently, making the phone\u2019s data permanently and irrevocably lost.\nWhen asked why he was discussing this method on the record, McAfee said, \u201cBecause I\u2019m assuming, because you kept on asking, that you aren\u2019t going to publish it.\u201d\nWhen the Daily Dot pointed out that McAfee had never secured such a promise, he said that the conversation was over and hung up.\n\u201cThe lie was an exaggeration of simplicity,\u201d McAfee said in a text message after the interview. \u201cAs the Inverse article explained, it would have been impossible in the time allowed to explain the fullness of the truth. If you fault me for that, then you, and possibly your readers, will have been the only one on the planet to have done so.\u201d\nMcAfee also said, \u201cI apologize for my anger.\u201d He added that it \u201cseemed absurd to me to focus on a simplification of a technique, given the stakes at risk\u2014a potentially Orwellian state initiated by the populace ignoring the truth of what the FBI is trying to do to us.\u201d\nIllustration via Max Fleishman",

        "title": "Judge: Order to Compel Apple Has Been 'Unenforceable' All Along",
        "body": "On Monday, less than 24 hours before the hearing was scheduled to start, the US government asked to cancel its big court date in the Apple vs FBI fight. The judge convened a quick conference with the Department of Justice and Apple attorneys. A transcript shows the judge repeatedly emphasizing that the order to compel Apple to create a backdoor for the government is \"unenforceable\" and has been so since the court battle began weeks ago.\nAdvertisement\nThe March 22 hearing was set to be an all-out battle. Both sides planned to call witnesses, with one to two hours of live testimony expected in court. Lawyers for Apple said that the judge had set aside four to five hours total for the hearing. The court was clearly braced for a storm of media attention, with three overflow rooms set aside for spectators (a total of 324 seats, including the main courtroom), and with a special court order announcing a first-come, first-serve ticketing system (starting at 7 AM) reminiscent of Supreme Court practices, along with an advisory that the security line could only process 50 people per hour.\nBut all this preparation was for naught, when the government moved for a continuance at the very last minute. Prosecutors said that an \"outside party\" (now thought to be an Israeli forensics firm) had \"demonstrated to the FBI a possible method for unlocking Farook's iPhone.\"\nIt's hard to tell how the hearing-that-never-was would have actually gone. But on Tuesday, Cryptome published the transcript to the conference that happened right before the judge granted the government's request to cancel the hearing. It shows the judge pushing back\u2014gently\u2014against the government, while the government backpedaled on the aggressive stance it had taken against Apple in its filings.\nScreenshot from the transcript.\nOn February 16, Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym issued an order to compel Apple to assist the FBI in searching a work-issued iPhone belonging to Syed Rizwan Farook, the suspected shooter in the December 2015 San Bernardino attack. In order to access the contents of the phone, the FBI asked Apple for custom software that would disable certain security mechanisms, allowing the agency to brute-force the password. Apple has been fighting that court order. The company and the Department of Justice were set to argue their positions in court on March 22.\nAdvertisement\nApple's lawyers called into the March 21 conference, agreeing to the government's request to cancel the hearing. But they also asked the judge to vacate the February 16 order. The order had been premised on the government's claim that Apple was the only party that could help them access the phone\u2014now that the DOJ had turned up this \"outside party,\" the order was invalid. The DOJ disagreed, saying that since the Justice Department wasn't sure whether the method would work, it would be premature.\nWhile the judge sided with DOJ and left her February 16 order in place, she emphasized that \"the order that was entered is unenforceable and is stayed.\" The judge said that she was \"struggling\" to see the difference between vacating the February 16 order and leaving it in place, since the order had no legal effect for the time being.\nOn March 1, in a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) blasted Apple for flouting the law, by not complying with Magistrate Judge Pym's order. The judge's own remarks\u2014while not directed at Gowdy\u2014serve to rebutt him.\n\"I certainly don't think, let me just comment, that Apple's been flouting the order,\" said Magistrate Judge Pym in the meeting on March 21. \"The order, essentially\u2014it isn't\u2014pending a final decision, there's not really\u2014it's not in a stage that it could be enforced at this point.\"\nThe transcript also shows prosecutors backpedaling on some of the more hostile things they've said about Apple, claiming that they are \"not saying anything nefarious about Apple.\"\nAdvertisement\nTheodore Boutrous, one of the lawyers for Apple on this case, responded by quoting the government's own filings back to them. \"Just on page 2 of their reply and opposition brief they declare, 'Apple's rhetoric is not only false, but is corrosive of the very institutions that are best able to safeguard our liberty and our rights.'\"\nScreenshot from the transcript.\nWhile the DOJ canceled the court date ostensibly because an \"outside party\" had demonstrated a forensic technique at the last minute, the timing is still suspicious. The most likely forensic technique is one that experts have been discussing for weeks\u2014in fact, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) even mentioned it to FBI Director James Comey in the House Judiciary Committee hearing on March 1.\nIs the government retreating from the San Bernardino iPhone fight because its lawyers think the judge is likely to rule against them? It's possible. After a flood of amicus briefs and unprecedented media attention on a magisterial proceeding, Judge Pym might be having second thoughts about the order she issued on February 16. If the hearing had gone poorly for the government, the DOJ would have lost face on a national stage. But the DOJ hasn't fully backed out yet, and it still has an appeal in a similar case pending on the East Coast.",

Speaking at the RSA Conference, Secretary Ashton Carter declared, \u201cI\u2019m not a believer in backdoors. It\u2019s not realistic and it\u2019s not technically accurate.\u201d\nImage Credit: Blaise Zerega/VentureBeat\nSecretary Carter also warned against the creation of a new law that would compel technology companies to unlock data upon request by the government. Currently several U.S. Senators have voiced support for such a bill. Speaking for the Department of Defense, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not in the executive branch seeking legislation of this kind. I don\u2019t think writing a law without an exploration of all the technical solutions out there\u201d is a good idea. Further, he cautioned against \u201ca law written by people [without tech expertise] or written in an atmosphere of anger and grief.\u201d\nSecretary Carter\u2019s remarks came in discussion with Ted Schlein, general partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, Caufield & Byers, during a session entitled, \u201cA Conversation on Collaboration Between Silicon Valley and the Department of Defense,\u201d which seemed to be an olive branch to the tech community amid the bitter acrimony arising from Apple\u2019s standoff with the FBI. Secretary Carter explained that he doesn\u2019t see one single solution to the encryption cases, but instead sees many different pieces to a cooperative approach. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t let one case drive the solution,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to innovate our way to a sensible result.\u201d\nFor more coverage of Apple and the FBI\u2019s fight over unlocking the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone, visit our timeline of the case here.",

As with most Apple media events, it will kick off at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time.\nSeveral products are expected to be showcased at the event, including the new 9.7-inch iPad, the 4-inch iPhone SE, and new Apple Watch bands. There's also a possibility that some Mac refreshes could be announced as the time is right for updates, but there have been no rumors confirming that is the case.\nHeadlining the event will be the 4-inch iPhone SE and a new 9.7-inch iPad. Rumors suggest the iPhone SE will look nearly identical to the iPhone 5s, but it will include new internal hardware that brings it in line with newer Apple devices. It is rumored to have an A9 chip, an improved camera, and NFC support for use with Apple Pay.\nThe new 9.7-inch iPad has been referred to as the iPad Air 3, but recent rumors have suggested it may instead be branded as an iPad Pro. The device is said to include many iPad Pro features, like a four-speaker design, a Smart Connector for connecting accessories, and display improvements for Apple Pencil support. It may also be the first iPad to feature a rear LED flash.\nApple also plans to introduce new Apple Watch bands at the event. Existing bands will likely be available in new colors and there may be new product lines, such as a rumored nylon band and a Space Black Milanese Loop.\nApple will be live streaming the event on its website and through the Apple TV.

        "title": "Apple asks the FBI: How hard did you really try to hack into the iPhone?",
        "body": "There\u2019s no question that Apple\u2019s ongoing legal dispute with the FBI has brought a myriad of complex legal, security, and policy issues to the forefront. But if we put those serious issues aside for just a moment, one of the more interesting aspects of the case, I think, is that the FBI even needed Apple\u2019s help in the first place.\nEspecially given how pervasive and advanced the NSA\u2019s surveillance and hacking techniques were even just a few years ago, many people, including myself, were of the opinion that government agencies, from the FBI to the CIA, likely had the technical expertise to effectively hack into any device and monitor anyone, anywhere.\nMUST SEE: The 10 best new movies and TV shows coming to Netflix in March\nThat being the case, it always struck me as odd and somewhat surprising that the FBI didn\u2019t already have a way to bypass the iPhone\u2019s passcode security scheme given that it\u2019s been in existence for years now. After all, the iPhone involved in the San Bernardino shooting was an iPhone 5c, which is to say that there\u2019s no Secure Enclave or Touch ID to hack around.\nIs it really feasible that the FBI, for nearly a decade, hasn\u2019t developed a means to break into a passcode protected iPhone, even if that iPhone was set up to erase itself after 10 incorrect passcode entries?\nAssuming that that\u2019s the reality we\u2019re living in, are we also to believe that the NSA, which employs innumerable technical wizards and has no shortage of zero-day exploits (per Edward Snowden) is similarly unable to access the San Bernardino terrorist\u2019s iPhone?\nPerhaps I\u2019m giving the NSA too much credit here, but one can almost imagine NSA engineers watching this saga unfold and smirking to themselves, armed with the knowledge that they\u2019ve been able to bypass a data-protected iPhone for years.\nAll of that said, one of the more interesting aspects of Apple\u2019s recently filed motion to vacate argues that the FBI may not have tried all possible avenues to hack into the shooter\u2019s iPhone 5c.\nIn a section titled, \u201cThe Government Has Not Demonstrated Apple\u2019s Assistance Was Necessary To Effectuating The Warrant\u201d, Apple argues that there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that the FBI sought assistance from other agencies (read: the NSA, the CIA) when it came to unlocking the iPhone in question.\nA third party cannot be compelled to assist the government unless the government is authorized to act and the third party\u2019s participation is imperative. \u2026 Moreover, the government has not made any showing that it sought or received technical assistance from other federal agencies with expertise in digital forensics, which assistance might obviate the need to conscript Apple to create the back door it now seeks. \u2026 As such, the government has not demonstrated that \u201cthere is no conceivable way\u201d to extract data from the phone.\nIt\u2019s an interesting argument that was even brought up, albeit quickly, during yesterday\u2019s congressional hearing on mobile device encryption and the balance between American security and privacy.\nDuring the course of the hearing, FBI director James Comey was asked if the FBI sought help from other intelligence agencies.\nThe Washington Post reports:\nLater in the hearing, Comey was specifically asked if the FBI had talked to other government agencies, including the NSA. \u201cYes is the answer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to anybody who will talk to us about it.\u201d When he was asked again whether other agencies could have helped them access the phone, he said Apple had effectively created phones that could not be broken into, which is why they had to resort to court action.\nIt\u2019s hard to know exactly what\u2019s being alluded to here and if Comey is being a bit coy.\nSo we know that the FBI sought out help from other intelligence agencies, but did those agencies agree to help? Did they refuse? Did they claim they lacked the technical know-how to hack into the iPhone? Is it at all possible that the NSA is keeping its iPhone hacking methods under wraps and told the FBI that there\u2019s nothing they can do? And just when, exactly, did the FBI seek out assistance from the NSA?\nMore than likely, we\u2019ll never find out the answers to these questions. In the meantime, it will certainly be fascinating to see how Apple\u2019s legal tussle with the FBI plays out now that it\u2019s captured the attention of lawmakers and citizens alike.",

        "body": "Harvard Law professor Susan Crawford and former special assistant to President Obama has written a blog post setting out the reason why she believes it is legally impossible for the FBI to win its case. The piece is entitled \u2018The Law is Clear: The FBI Cannot Make Apple Rewrite its OS.\u2019\nWhile the FBI is relying on an extremely broad interpretation of the All Writs Act, Crawford points out that it is an accepted principle that specific laws take precedence over more general ones \u2013 and there is a specific law which outlaws what the FBI is asking for \u2026\nThat law is the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). CALEA grants the government a lot of wiretapping powers, she says, but also clearly sets out the limits to those powers.\nThe government won an extensive, specific list of wiretapping assistance requirements in connection with digital communications. But in exchange, in Section 1002 of that act, the Feds gave up authority to \u201crequire any specific design of equipment, facilities, services, features or system configurations\u201d from any phone manufacturer.\nThat wording, she argues, means that the government is specifically prohibited from requiring Apple to create a compromised version of iOS.\nThe government is aware of this, and the blog piece describes how it is attempting to argue its way around the issue, but Crawford says the FBI\u2019s brief uses a circular argument. CALEA has, she writes, \u201cno gaps; no interpretive sunlight: CALEA stops the government from doing what it wants to do to Apple.\u201d\nThe next hearing takes place at the U.S. District Courthouse in Riverside, California, on 22nd March.

Unsurprisingly, that didn't sit well with SXSW attendees, who tend to side with Apple in favor of stronger encryption.\nThere's just no way to create a special key for government that couldn't also be taken advantage of by the Russians, the Chinese, or others who want access to the sensitive information we all carry in our pockets everyday.\" - Rep. Darrell Issa\nRep. Issa, R-Calif., spoke with USA Today about the encryption debate, and didn't mince words when it came to Obama's response.\n\"It was tone deaf,\" Issa reportedly said. \"He did not read the room in that portion of the answer. There's just no way to create a special key for government that couldn't also be taken advantage of by the Russians, the Chinese, or others who want access to the sensitive information we all carry in our pockets everyday.\"\nIn Obama's view, un-hackable encryption is not an ideal solution. He believes law enforcement agencies should be given access to devices in limited cases, likening it to TSA checks at the airport or drunk driving checkpoints.\nBut to Issa, those comments were \"a detriment to privacy.\"\nUnlike many in politics or law enforcement, Issa has a background in technology. He was co-founder and CEO of Directed Electronics, a maker of car security products including the Viper alarm. He also served as chairman of the Consumer Electronics Association, which runs CES, from 1998 to 2001 before becoming a member of the U.S. Congress.\nIssa's stance is in opposition to many of his colleagues in Washington, who largely side with the FBI and believe Apple should create a \"backdoor\" to access iPhones that may be of interest to law enforcement. At the center of the debate is an iPhone 5c that was used for work by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terrorist attack late last year.\nApple has countered by saying that creating a \"backdoor\" to its iOS platform would not only be a major security issue, but it could also set a precedent for governments to request access to devices in questionable situations.",

        "body": "Apple has announced a new partnership with Dubset Media Holdings to stream thousands of remixed songs and DJ mixes, both based on original recordings, that were previously unavailable due to copyright issues. Apple Music will be the first streaming music service to provide access to these previously unlicensed tracks, according to Billboard.\nDubset will use a technology called MixBank to analyze a remix or DJ mix file, identify existing recordings within the file, pay the necessary rights holders, and distribute the mix through Apple Music and other streaming services. The process can take about 15 minutes for a 60-minute recording.\nBut licensing remixes and DJ mixes, both based on original recordings, is incredibly complex. A single mix could have upward of 600 different rights holders. According to CEO Stephen White, a typical mix has 25 to 30 songs that require payments to 25 to 30 record labels and anywhere from two to ten publishers for each track. [\u2026] MixBank matches the recordings used in the remix or DJ mix against a database of three-audio snippets from Gracenote, where White was CEO prior to joining Dubset. He says fingerprinting is a \u201cbrute force\u201d tool that can provide MixBand with up to 100 possible matches for each three-second match.\nThe rise in popularity of the EDM genre has resulted in an increasing number of user-generated remixes, mash-ups, and DJ mixes of popular songs, and this partnership will help bring those underground tracks to Apple Music and potentially \"all 400 distributors worldwide\" in the future, said White.\nDubset will retain a percentage of revenue for providing in-house licensing and pay the DJ or remixer a share of that amount. The service \"allows everyone to make money on this content for the first time,\" according to White. The digital distributor has agreements with over 14,000 labels and publishers.\nIn related news, Beats 1 recently announced that popular EDM artist deadmau5 will host his own show this Friday at 3:00 p.m. Pacific.",

It would make sense to launch MacOS 11 this year, too, with new OS versions across the line up (iOS 10, watchOS 3 and tvOS 10) to make it a banner year.\nThe UNIX-based OS X has been around for 15 years, so it\u2019s probably time to start calling it something new.

That report said the notebooks would be ready by the third quarter, which corresponds to a July-September timeframe -- possibly shortly after a WWDC announcement.\nApple currently offers the MacBook Air in 11\" and 13\" sizes, and it has never released a 15\" MacBook Air. In fact, many have assumed the MacBook Air will be discontinued at some point as declining costs allow the MacBook to become Apple's mainstream notebook offering. A redesigned MacBook Air, possibly with a long-awaited Retina display, could be considered a bit of a surprise.\nThe current MacBook Pro perhaps better corresponds with the rumored 13\" and 15\" sizes, but whether Apple is able to fit pro-level hardware in an \"ultra-thin\" design similar to the lower-spec 12-inch MacBook remains to be seen. There is also the possibility that the new 13\" and 15\" notebooks will be MacBooks, but the notion seems questionable unless Apple discontinues the year-old 12\" model.\nApple's refreshed Mac lineup is expected to feature Intel's faster Skylake processors and Thunderbolt 3 with USB-C, while the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro are also deserving candidates for an overall redesign.\nApple last refreshed the 13-inch MacBook Pro in March 2015, while the 15-inch model was updated in May. For this reason, the 13-inch model is classified as Early 2015, and the 15-inch model is Mid 2015. Both notebooks received Force Touch trackpads, faster flash storage, longer battery life, and improved graphics.\nThe Early 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro is based on Intel's last-generation Broadwell chip architecture, while the 15-inch model still has older Haswell architecture. Over the past year, Intel has announced Skylake chips appropriate for the 13-inch MacBook Pro, 15-inch MacBook Pro, 12-inch MacBook, and MacBook Airs.",

The questions that the Department of Justice is posing, at the very core of the matter, are questions of whether or not we should be a free people. The very government that we founded to protect our liberties is now, in a very raw way, questioning them. This should shock you. It should shock every American, and it is no doubt shocking the rest of the watching world. How can the freest country in the world, a beacon for those in oppressive countries, lay down their speech, their privacy, their identities over a dead terrorist's iPhone? The shootings that took place in San Bernardino were horrible and flat out evil, and I mourned for the victims\u2026 but the greatest damage that Syed Farook stands to cause is to our country and our constitutional rights as a whole; giving up our rights will ultimately affect the liberty and safety of generations to come. Make no mistake about it \u2013 Syed Farook would be pleased to see this agenda being played out in the court system today. We should not be pleased. We should be indignant. We should be deeply offended. Offended that anyone would attempt to curtail rights that our families have died, and continue dying, to protect.\nMore from \u0179dziarski's tweeted analysis, and that of others who read the brief, below.\nIt's very clear from this brief that Apple is schooling DOJ, and doing it quite well. \u2014 Jonathan \u0179dziarski (@JZdziarski) March 15, 2016\nAs always, this is an excellent brief from Apple.

        "title": "Congressman Suggests FBI Is Taking Advantage of San Bernardino Tragedy to Push Agenda",
        "body": "A leading House Democrat expressed serious concern on Tuesday that the FBI is exploiting the ISIS-inspired massacre of 14 people in San Bernardino to sidestep Congress on the encryption debate.\nRep. John Conyers, D-Mich., said it was troubling \u201cthat in the middle of an ongoing congressional debate on this subject, the FBI would ask a federal magistrate to give them the special access to secure products that this committee, this Congress, and the administration have so far refused to provide.\u201d He spoke at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, of which he is the ranking Democratic member.\n\u201cWhy has the government taken this step and forced this issue?\u201d he asked.\nIt was a rhetorical question.\n\u201cI suspect that part of the answer lies in an email obtained by the Washington Post and reported to the public last September,\u201d Conyers said.\n\u201cIn it, a senior lawyer in the intelligence community writes that \u2018although the legislative environment towards encryption is very hostile today \u2026 it could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement.\u2019\u201d\nConyers continued: \u201cI am deeply concerned by this cynical mindset. And I would be deeply disappointed if it turns out that the government is found to be exploiting a national tragedy to pursue a change in the law.\u201d\nThe congressman was referring to a leaked letter authored by the intelligence community\u2019s top lawyer, Robert S. Litt. In the letter, Litt advised \u201ckeeping our options open for such a situation.\u201d\nA federal magistrate judge in California last month ordered Apple to help the FBI access San Bernardino killer Syed Rizwan Farook\u2019s iPhone by developing software to turn off built-in security features \u2014 essentially bypassing the phone\u2019s encryption.\nMost technologists argue it\u2019s a type of \u201cbackdoor\u201d into the device \u2014 something various congressional committees have been debating for months.\nLaw enforcement agencies say they need a way to access all digital communications to conduct investigations, while technologists and privacy advocates say any vulnerability in a device, whether built into the encryption or around it, gives hackers and criminals a foothold to steal private information.\nBut now, Conyers argues, that debate is being yanked from Congress\u2019s hands. If the FBI succeeds in its court case, it could ask other companies to hack their products too, no matter what type of encryption is involved.\nIf you can get past the door, why do you need to ask Congress for a key?\nFBI Director James Comey insisted that the FBI is not trying to bypass Congress. \u201cI think that the courts are competent to resolve the narrow question about the scope of the All Writs Act,\u201d he said during the hearing, referring to a colonial-era law that allows the government to ask a third party to assist it in carrying out a legal request.\nAnd although Comey has repeatedly insisted that the San Bernardino case is a narrow one, he acknowledged at the hearing that \u201cany decision of a court about a matter is potentially useful for other courts, that\u2019s what precedent is.\u201d\n\u201cThere are issues about backdoors,\u201d Comey said. \u201cThere\u2019s already a door.\u201d The FBI, he said, is asking Apple to \u201ctake the vicious guard dog away and let us try and pick the lock.\u201d",

        "body": "Here\u2019s the discussion, which also included Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, and Dan Froomkin, Washington editor of The Intercept. The comments in question come at about the 30-minute mark.\n\u201cThe FBI says Apple has the \u2018exclusive technical means\u2019\u201d to unlock the phone, Snowden said during a discussion at Common Cause\u2019s Blueprint for Democracy conference.\nThe FBI last month persuaded a federal judge that the only way to get into the phone was to make Apple write code to undermine its own security protocols. Apple is refusing to comply.\nSnowden further explained on Twitter: \u201cThe global technological consensus is against the FBI,\u201d he wrote \u2014 linking to a blog post on the American Civil Liberties Union website explaining exactly how the FBI could have bypassed the iPhone\u2019s auto-erase function on its own. That\u2019s \u201cone example,\u201d he wrote.\nOther technologists have explained how the FBI could have easily accessed the phone\u2019s latest iCloud backup if agents working with San Bernardino County had not reset the iCloud password.\nEven so, security researchers say there are other options, like \u201cde-capping\u201d the phone\u2019s memory chip to access it outside the phone (which Snowden has also mentioned), or resetting the phone\u2019s internal counter so that you can guess the passwords as many times as you want. Those techniques are hard and expensive and could destroy the phone, experts say \u2014 but have worked in the past.\nAnd that\u2019s not to mention any shadowy tactics the spies from the government\u2019s intelligence community might have. The NSA and CIA have worked for almost 10 years to develop ways to hack into Apple devices, as revealed by The Intercept last year.\nThe key may be that none of those ways would be nearly as easy for the FBI as making Apple do it \u2014 this time, and from now on.\nThe NSA has been mysteriously absent from the FBI-Apple fight. Conceivably, it tried and failed to hack the phone, but that seems unlikely. Another possibility is that the NSA was excluded on purpose, so the FBI could create a test case.",

        "title": "Mossberg: The iPhone 7 had better be spectacular",
        "body": "Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Re/code by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Re/code.\nOne day this fall, if things occur as usual, Apple will stage a big event to introduce the next flagship iPhone. And, based on the events of this month, that smartphone better be great.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not that I have any beef at first glance with the revamped, smaller iPhone SE that Apple unveiled this week, or with the downsized iPad Pro that accompanied it. Each makes business sense \u2014 especially the modernized 4-inch phone model, the iPhone SE. Both seemed to work well in the few minutes I had to fiddle with them, and I\u2019ll have reviews of them soon.\nI expect these products will make significant minorities of users happy. Plus, the $399 base price on the iPhone SE (compared to $650 or so for the 6s) may help Apple in overseas markets where cheaper and smaller phones are popular.\nBut these latest iPhones and iPads don\u2019t break much new technology ground.They are derivative products \u2014 the iPhone SE is based on the iPhone 5 design first introduced in 2012. And its innards and features mostly, but don\u2019t quite, match those of the current top mainstream model, the 6S, rolled out last year.\nI stand by my view that the premium iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are the best smartphones on the market.\nThe latest iPhones and iPads are derivative products\nBut the top-of-the-line iPhones were challenged impressively just two weeks ago by rival Samsung\u2019s beautiful, carefully engineered new Galaxy S7 phones. A Verge test showed the Samsung\u2019s cameras are better. Only the sadly typical software mess on those phones makes them lag behind Apple\u2019s long-superior iPhone.\nIf the smartphone category is to take a leap forward, and the iPhone is to maintain its ever-thinning lead as the best smartphone you can buy, Apple needs to impress big time in the fall.\nAs always, rumors about the next iPhone abound online. They include new types of wireless and wired headphones, including the elimination of the standard headphone jack; a dual-lens camera that would allow for a form of true optical zooming; and even thinner dimensions.\nI don\u2019t have any inside information about the next flagship iPhone, and I don\u2019t own any stock or have any other financial interest in Apple, or in any other company whose products I cover.\nBut here are seven things I\u2019d love to see Apple do to keep moving the iPhone \u2014 and the smartphone itself \u2014 forward. Some of these items are catchups with competitors, others would be new.\nFirst of all \u2014 and this is very tough scientifically \u2014 Apple could make a big leap in battery life. The company has long done a decent job for people who are moderate users, or who, like me, have great cell tower proximity, which keeps the phone from battery-draining tower searches. But I know too many iPhone users who are forced to recharge their phones multiple times a day or carry around bulky extra-battery cases or portable chargers. Apple even brought out such a case itself recently. Fixing battery life would be a huge win.\nThis might mean Apple would have to return to a slightly thicker phone, and not make the next model even thinner. But many users would take that tradeoff for a phone they could be confident would last over a long day, or even more \u2014 without a giant battery case bulge.\nSecondly, and closely related, is charging. iPhones aren\u2019t especially slow at charging, but Samsung is now faster, and there are companies working on systems that offer somewhat less battery life in exchange for ultra-quick charging that can take as little as five minutes. Plus, Apple should consider enabling wireless charging so its users can take advantage of charging pads being installed in places like Starbucks, without a special case.\nThird, it\u2019s time to banish, or seriously shrink, the large top and bottom bezels on the iPhone, and even the smaller side ones, so a large screen can be packed into a smaller phone body. Samsung did a good job with this on the S7, especially on the Edge model. The real selling point of the iPhone SE isn't the smaller screen, but the smaller body that's easier to hold. A larger screen in a smaller overall package would greatly benefit users.\nIt's time to banish, or seriously shrink, the top and bottom bezels\nMy fourth wish is for some sort of optical zoom that doesn\u2019t require a heavy telescoping lens. The rumored dual-lens camera might provide this. Previous efforts at unobtrusive optical zooming by other phone makers haven\u2019t been good, so Apple has a real opportunity here. The iPhone camera also needs to do better in low-light situations and to activate even more quickly \u2014 great speed is one reason Samsung\u2019s new camera is better.\nMy fifth wish is for a hardier phone. What, you say, the iPhone is pretty sturdy! And its body is. But it\u2019s never been water resistant, like Samsung phones. Its back is slippery. And its screen cracks pretty easily in common kinds of drops. That\u2019s why the beautiful designs in Apple TV ads are rarely seen in real life because the phones are cloaked by ugly (if profitable) cases and gauzy screen protectors.\nSixth, it\u2019s time to bundle adequate internal storage in the base model, without a price increase. Sixteen gigabytes just doesn't cut it anymore, even in a cloud-based world, and storage is cheap. The base iPhone should have 32 GB of storage, or even 64 \u2014 even if that cuts Apple\u2019s margin a little.\nFinally, as I\u2019ve written before, Apple needs to up its game in phone software (also on the Mac, but that\u2019s another column). Its Mail app needs to do a much better job of handling Gmail, which has a billion users, even if rival Google makes that hard. Users should be able to select their own favorite apps for core functions. Apple Maps and Siri both need much more work to be consistently reliable, and it\u2019s time to make iMessage, which works well, cross-platform.",

        "title": "Apple launches Safari Technology Preview, a new browser aimed at web developers",
        "body": "Apple today announced it\u2019s expanding its efforts in the area of web development, with the launch of a new version of its Safari web browser, designed specifically for developers. Called Safari Technology Preview, the company says this browser will allow developers to get an early look at upcoming web technologies in OS X and iOS, including things like the latest layout technologies, visual effects, and other developer tools.\nThe idea is to allow developers to more easily get their hands on these technologies and be able to experiment, then offer feedback to Apple earlier on so the company can make the necessary improvements.\nOf course, Apple has for a long time offered Nightly builds of WebKit, the open source browser engine that today runs on hundreds of millions of devices and powers Apple\u2019s Safari. However, getting access to these builds takes a bit more effort than using the new Safari Technology Preview browser. Instead, with the new browser, its updates are distributed every two weeks by way of the Mac App Store\u2019s software update mechanism. That means it\u2019s less hassle to run a browser that features the latest advances in web technologies, including HTML, JavaScript, CSS and WebKit.\nPlus, the browser allows developers to access the latest versions of Web Inspector and Responsive Design Mode \u2013 the latter which is used to help developers build websites that work across devices, from desktop to mobile.\nOther advantages this version of Safari offers over using a Nightly build is that it\u2019s signed and validated by Apple, and it works with iCloud. The lack of iCloud support, in fact, has been a pain point for web developers who wanted to use a Nightly build as their primary browser. Now, they\u2019ll have a different option, while still being able to use their bookmarks, access their Reading List and access the tabs they\u2019ve opened on other devices.\nIn addition, Safari Technology Preview is a standalone application, meaning it can run side-by-side with the shipping version of Safari, to make it easy to switch between the two builds. (The Technology Preview version will feature a purple icon to differentiate it from the shipping version.)\nWhile the big news is the product\u2019s actual launch, developers will also likely be interested to learn what\u2019s shipping in the debut version, out today. This includes a variety of first-release features, such as:\nECMAScript 6 : Apple says this is one of the most complete implementations of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), the latest version of JavaScript. ES6 offers support for classes that allow developers to use the object-oriented principles in their JavaScript code, iterators, and new APIs.\n: Apple says this is one of the most complete implementations of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), the latest version of JavaScript.

Because the browser offers the latest web technologies, there are real consumer benefits that you can see and feel as you use the web \u2013 like better performance and a richer web experience, for example.\nSafari Technology Preview is available today, as of 10 AM PT on developer.apple.com/safari/download.",

        "body": "When the DOJ filed its response brief last week, Apple attorneys didn\u2019t even try to hide their disgust. During a colorful conference call with reporters, Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell was quick to call the DOJ\u2019s accusations \u201coffensive.\u201d\nIn addition to suggesting that Apple \u201chas a different and sinister relationship with China\u201d, the DOJ also issued a thinly veiled threat indicating that it might seek to compel Apple to hand over the source code to iOS.\n\u201cIn 30 years of practice,\u201d Sewell added, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a legal brief that was more intended to smear the other side with false accusations and innuendo, and less intended to focus on the real merits of the case.\u201d\nDON\u2019T MISS: The FBI\u2019s worst nightmare is coming true\nAnd speaking of false accusations, you might recall that the DOJ, on a few occasions, boldly categorized Apple\u2019s staunch defense of encryption as nothing more than a cheap marketing ploy designed to curry favor with consumers and increase device sales.\nApple\u2019s reluctance to assist the FBI, the DOJ wrote, is \u201cbased on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.\u201d\nYesterday, Apple finally addressed such accusations head on, completely destroying the DOJ\u2019s already flimsy and baseless argument in the process.\nIn a detailed footnote found in its response brief, Apple explained that encryption has never been used, referenced or alluded to in any of Apple\u2019s marketing efforts. Additionally, Apple dismissed the notion that it implements security measures in order to \u201cconfound\u201d law enforcement. On the contrary, Apple explained that it \u201cprioritizes the security and privacy of its users, and that priority is reflected in Apple\u2019s increasingly secure operating systems\u2026\u201d\nThe full footnote reads as follows:\nThe government accuses Apple of developing the passcode-based encryption features at issue in this case for marketing purposes. This is a reckless and unfounded allegation. Since passcode-based encryption was first introduced in October 2014, Apple has produced 627 separate ads in the United States and approximately 1,793 ads worldwide. These ads have generated 99 and 253 billion impressions, respectively. Not a single one advertised or promoted the ability of Apple\u2019s software to block law enforcement requests for access to the contents of Apple devices. The idea that Apple enhances its security to confound law enforcement is nonsense. Apple\u2019s \u201cchain of trust\u201d process\u2014which follows accepted industry best practices\u2014is designed to secure its mobile platform against the never-ending threat from hackers and cyber-criminals. It is the same process that helps protect desktop computers from viruses and Trojan horses, and that ensures hackers do not tamper with the software on automobiles.\nAs an aside, it\u2019s fascinating that Apple in about 17 months time has rolled out nearly 1,800 separate ads.\nApple\u2019s full response can be read below.\nAPPLE INC.\u2019S REPLY TO GOVERNMENT\u2019S OPPOSITION TO APPLE INC.\u2019S MOTION TO VACATE ORDER COMPELLING APPLE INC\u2026. by Roberto Baldwin",
