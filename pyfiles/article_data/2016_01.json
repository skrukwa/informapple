        "title": "Apple CEO Tim Cook demands Obama White House formally defend Americans' right to strong encryption",
        "body": "Jenna McLaughlin at The Intercept writes that Apple CEO Tim Cook \"lashed out at the high-level delegation of Obama administration officials who came calling on tech leaders in San Jose last week.\"\nCook is said to have criticized the Obama White House for a lack of leadership on the freedom to keep one's own private digital life private, as FBI and other law enforcement top brass condemn even basic forms of crypto and secure messaging as \"tools of terrorists.\"\nThe Apple CEO is reported to have demanded the Obama administration to issue a strong public statement defending the use of unbreakable encryption. That's pretty undeniably awesome, and those of us who believe in the right to encrypt need the most powerful allies we can get right now.\nSnip:\nThe White House should come out and say \"no backdoors,\" Cook said. That would mean overruling repeated requests from FBI Director James Comey and other administration officials that tech companies build some sort of special access for law enforcement into otherwise unbreakable encryption. Technologists agree that any such measure could be exploited by others. But Attorney General Loretta Lynch responded to Cook by speaking of the \"balance\" necessary between privacy and national security \u2014 a balance that continues to be debated within the administration. The exchange was described to The Intercept by two people who were briefed on the meeting, which the White House called to discuss a variety of counterterrorism issues with representatives from Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Cloudflare, Google, Drop Box, Microsoft, and LinkedIn.\nThank you, Tim Cook.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s iPhone 6S outperforms every Android phone in a major benchmark test",
        "body": "Benchmark and performance enthusiasts look forward to AnTuTu\u2019s Global Top 10 Best Performance Smartphones each year, but it\u2019s a little different this time around. Past reports only included Android phones, but thanks to AnTuTu 6.0, which was released last year as a cross-platform app, the iPhone can now be included in the test.\nUnfortunately for Android fans, the result wasn\u2019t so good. To say the iPhone 6S obliterated the competition would be an understatement. The iPhone 6S came in first with a score of 132,620. The next phone in line, the Huawei Mate 8, scored only 92,746. If you\u2019re doing the math, that means the iPhone 6S is about 42 percent faster.\nSamsung, Android\u2019s most popular brand, performed far worse. It still came in at fourth place among the phones tested, though. The iPhone 6S was about 60 percent faster than both the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 Edge Plus.\nEven last year\u2019s iPhone 6 outperformed most other Android phones, as it placed sixth overall. It\u2019s about 3 percent faster than the Google Nexus 6P, which became available only a few months ago.\nWhat\u2019s most interesting about this data is the fact that Apple isn\u2019t in a spec war like the one in which Android manufacturers find themselves. Companies that make Android phones continue to push the boundaries with octa-core processors and as much as 4GB of RAM. The competition among Android phones has heated up so much that companies like Samsung and Huawei are now manufacturing their own in-house processors.\nHowever, the iPhone 6S is rocking its own 64-bit dual-core A9 processor with only 2GB of RAM. Kudos have to be given to Apple on its ability to be so efficient with so little. The efficiency not only gives the iPhone more power, but it likely helps battery life as well, which is a good thing, seeing as iPhone battery life is notoriously short.\nAnTuTu tests only one device per model and averages 500 data samples for each phone. The company didn\u2019t include the iPhone 6S Plus or the iPhone 6 Plus because there were no significant differences when compared to the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6. It\u2019s unclear if that was also the case for the Samsung phone that was chosen for the test.\nAlthough the results are intriguing, it\u2019s important to note that benchmark tests aren\u2019t everything, and sometimes real-world performance is different.\n[amz_native_shopping asins=\u201dB015E8W1RC,B018QCK1M0,B013WACF4S,B0147EVKCQ\u201d linkid=\u201d971a23970d2329a713bde1411bc7bd0a\u201d title=\u201dRecommended Smart Phones\u201d]\nToday's tech news, curated and condensed for your inbox Subscribe Check your inbox!

        "title": "Good Guy Apple: \"Future operating systems like iOS8 and the current iOS9 are designed to be impenetrable by even Apple itself\"",
        "body": "A newly unsealed court transcript shows that Apple doesn\u2019t just support its average customers\u2019 right to encrypted communications: It even stands up to the government over meth dealers\u2019 phones.\nThe transcript comes from an October 2015 hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, in which a judge asked Apple to explain why it had ignored U.S. prosecutors\u2019 search warrants to unlock the phone of Jun Feng, who pled guilty to a conspiracy to attempt to distribute methamphetamines,and who was charged alongside six others.\nIt\u2019s a unique case: Feng had an iPhone 5s, which comes loaded with Apple\u2019s iOS7 operating system. In the past, that hadn\u2019t been a major problem. As an official from the Department of Homeland Security had previously testified, law enforcement had a device to easily run through every possible passcode to unlock an iPhone. But Feng\u2019s phone was configured to erase all its data if someone unsuccessfully tried 10 times in a row to unlock it.\nAt the time of the hearing, Apple seemed obstinate, warning in its publicly filed briefing that it wasn\u2019t going to perform this task on future cases. \u201cIn most cases now and in the future, the government\u2019s requested order would be substantially burdensome, as it would be impossible to perform,\u201d lawyers for the company wrote. Future operating systems like iOS8 and the current iOS9 are designed to be impenetrable by even Apple itself, it said.\nThe unsealed arguments paint a more nuanced debate. Prosecutors noted that since 2008, Apple has received at least 70 warrants to help view the contents of a suspect\u2019s phone. Those instances were a different kind of situation, Apple countered, as the government was instead asking for a technical service. Moreover, prosecution was for the first time pressuring Apple with the seldom-used All Writs Act, a law last updated in 1949.\nThat Apple protects users\u2019 privacy is undoubtedly part of its business model. One U.S. attorney argued that it was \u201cmore concerned with public perception\u201d than helping catch criminals. Around the time the transcript was taken, CEO Tim Cook was upping his comments on user privacy, declaring that the company would refuse to create backdoors into its encrypted messaging service.\n\u201cRight now Apple is aware that customer data is under siege from a variety of different directions. Never has the privacy and security of customer data been as important as it is now,\u201d Apple lawyer Marc Zwillinger said at the hearing. \u201cA hypothetical consumer could think if Apple is not in the business of accessing my data and if Apple has built a system to prevent itself from accessing my data, why is it continuing to comply with orders that don\u2019t have a clear lawful basis in doing so?\u201d\nThough Feng\u2019s case is settled, Apple still awaits the judge\u2019s decision.\nRead the transcript of the hearing here:\nPhoto via Andy Rennie/Flickr (CC BY SA 2.0)",

Apple has now paid out nearly $40 billion to developers worldwide since the App Store launched in 2008.\nApple marketing chief Phil Schiller said App Store sales topped $20 billion in 2015:\n\u201cThe App Store had a holiday season for the record books. We are excited that our customers downloaded and enjoyed so many incredible apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, spending over $20 billion on the App Store last year alone,\u201d said Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. \u201cWe're grateful to all the developers who have created the most innovative and exciting apps in the world for our customers. We can't wait for what's to come in 2016.\u201d\nApple said it has now created 1.9 million jobs in the U.S., with over 1.4 million of those jobs attributable to app development and non-IT jobs supported by the app ecosystem.

You\u2019d be wrong. Despite what you may read, the iPhone has not \u201cflatlined,\u201d and there is no evidence that this is the \u201cend of an era.\u201d More people bought iPhones from October to December than any three-month period in history \u2014 74.8 million of them were sold. So if you hear someone saying that Apple\u2019s \u201csuper-growth era\u201d is over, think twice.\nExpectations are too high. Wall Street analysts and technology pundits are unhappy with Apple\u2019s record sales of 74.8 million because it didn\u2019t grow enough. The figure is only 0.5 percent higher than Apple\u2019s record 2014 holiday sales of 74.5 million. Wall Street greedily wants faster growth, and the media is afraid that Apple\u2019s iPhone gravy train may finally derail.\nThe iPhone is not dying.\nApple sold 231.5 million iPhones in 2015, 20 percent more than it\u2019s ever sold before. And in 2016, there\u2019s no reason to think it won\u2019t sell a ton more. The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus didn\u2019t dramatically increase the number of people who buy iPhones like the 6 and 6 Plus did last year, but Apple is still selling more iPhones than ever, and historically, this is a repeating trend.\nThe iPhone 5S suffered a similar lack of growth two years ago. When it came out in late 2013, it looked identical to the iPhone 5 except for one big feature: It came in gold. Anticipating the problem, Apple also tried to re-release the iPhone 5 with colorful plastic cases, calling it the 5C, but it barely made a dent in sales. Growth slowed to 6.7 percent during a year when global smartphone sales grew more than 40 percent.\niPhone sales growth cooled down so much with the iPhone 5S, that even I believed that the iPhone had peaked, and had nowhere to go but down. That\u2019s what the data showed, after all. But I was wrong. Apple released two bigger, better iPhones and sales exploded again in 2014. Out of nowhere, sales climbed by 46 percent, doubling the global smartphone industry\u2019s growth.\nAfter the 5S, even I claimed that the iPhone had peaked. I was wrong.\nThe new features of the iPhone 6S were especially invisible. New abilities like 3D Touch are neat, but app developers haven\u2019t found many inspiring ways to use them yet. The new color, Rose Gold, hasn\u2019t flown off the shelves, either.\nThen again, a lot of big players boarded the struggle bus in 2015. The market for smartphones only ticked ahead by 10 percent (an estimate, as full figures aren\u2019t out yet), the lowest since the iPhone shook things up in 2008. LG shipped 60 million smartphones and Samsung also took a hit. It shipped 320 million smartphones, a 2 percent decline, despite pumping out more than 20 different phones in 2015 alone. Apple released two.\nFrom 2007 to 2011, Apple could do no wrong. No one could compete with what the iPhone offered, and because of it, Apple\u2019s phone tended to double in sales every year, like clockwork. But times have changed. The world is full of Android phones that look almost identical to the iPhone, which is why Android growth tends to sputter and spurt. Apple continues to climb, but its trajectory is determined by the innovations it packs into each new phone, and how many new hands those innovations appeal to.\nLoudmouths can make all the doom and gloom predictions they want, and point to Tim Cook\u2019s warning that iPhone sales will decline slightly (year over year), as evidence that it\u2019s curtains for Apple; they\u2019re shortsighted.\nUntil Tim Cook shows off the iPhone 7 this September, no one has an inkling of where iPhone sales are headed. Early rumors are already buzzing, and they don\u2019t paint a picture of a stagnant company. There are hints that iPhone 7 will have a new design, OLED screen, dual rear cameras with optical zoom, a screen with a built-in fingerprint reader, wireless charging, no headphone jack (a head scratcher), a waterproof liquid metal unibody, wireless earbuds, more RAM, and a faster processor.\nThe iPhone is not dying.

        "body": "Both Bank Of America and Wells Fargo are working on integrating Apple Pay into their ATMs, according to a source familiar with the teams on the projects. Engineers at both companies have been placed on multi-month assignments to build the Apple Pay options. I\u2019ve confirmed the identity of at least one engineer who publicly lists themselves as a Bank Of America employee.\nWells Fargo\u2019s head of ATMs Jonathan Velline implied Apple Pay would come to its ATMs. He confirmed that \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on the technology that allows us to hook to digital wallets, leveraging NFC on mobile phones to replace the card at the transaction at the ATM. Right now the wallet that we support is Android Pay.\u201d\nVelline continued \u201cBut we\u2019re also looking at lots of different mobile wallets and evaluating which ones are going to be appropriate for our customers. We\u2019ll likely add more mobile wallets throughout the year. We recognize our customers are going to have lots of different types of wallets based on their device, based on their bank, based on their OS, and we\u2019re going to continue to find the right balance of which wallets we\u2019re going to support. Right now the initial launch is with Android Pay, but that doesn\u2019t limit us from considering other mobile wallets.\u201d\nWhen I pressed harder and asked if that meant Apple Pay would likely be one of those mobile wallets, he admitted with a laugh \u201cI think that\u2019s a good assessment.\u201d\nWhen asked about whether its ATMs would work with Apple Pay, Bank Of America\u2019s Consumer Banking Products press representative Betty Riess told me \u201cWe already have number of mobile wallet programs\u2026\u201d implying Apple Pay could join them.\nShe confirmed that Bank Of America is \u201ccurrently developing a new cardless ATM solution. This solution will enable customers to leverage NFC (near field communication) technology on their smart phone in order to authenticate and complete transactions at a Bank of America ATM. We will roll out this capability in late February with associates at select ATMs in Silicon Valley, San Francisco, Charlotte, New York and Boston followed by a broader roll out to customers mid year.\u201d The Charlotte Observer reported news of the cardless ATMs yesterday but didn\u2019t specify that Apple Pay would be involved.\nRiess requested to double-check what she could say specifically about Apple Pay. When she called me back regarding the ATMs, she was more reserved, saying \u201cAt this point we\u2019re not confirming which phones they\u2019ll work with.\u201d But the iPhone is by far the most popular phone in the U.S., so this all meshes with our source saying Bank Of America is working on Apple Pay for ATMs.\nApple also did not respond to a request for comment. Bank Of America and Wells Fargo competitor Chase recently announced it will be rolling out cardless ATMs this year.\nWhile it\u2019s unclear exactly how Apple Pay at ATMs would work, it would likely allow people to withdraw money without needing their debit card or credit card. That could be especially useful if someone lost or forgot their wallet or card.\nUsers would likely tap their phone to the ATM\u2019s NFC point, which would bring up the passcode or thumbprint verification screen on the phone. Once confirmed, users would be able to access some ATM functionality as if they\u2019d inserted their card and entered their pin.\nWorking with Apple Pay could also save the banks money by protecting against fraud. It\u2019s much easier to duplicate a credit card than an iPhone. Apple Pay can be set to require a fingerprint scan, which ATMs don\u2019t offer. Apple Pay passcodes can also be long and complex, compared to the simple 4-digit pin codes used on debit cards.\nMost importantly, Apple Pay would thwart the use of card skimmers. These devices fit over the front of ATMs as a fake facade, and then steal the information from cards inserted into them. Switching to NFC and mobile phones would prevent this since there would be no card involved.\nThese anti-fraud incentives and consumer interest in the convenience of using NFC to withdraw money could spur banks to race to integrate Apple Pay.\n[Image Credit: Alex]",

        "title": "AMD Just announced a 14nm FinFET Polaris GPU Architecture. This is the first die shrink for GPU's in 5 years, and these could end up in 2016 macs.",
        "body": "For much of the last month we have been discussing bits and pieces of AMD\u2019s GPU plans for 2016. As part of the Radeon Technology Group\u2019s formation last year, the leader and chief architect of the group, Raja Koduri, has set about to make his mark on AMD\u2019s graphics technology. Along with consolidating all graphics matters under the RTG, Raja and the rest of the RTG have also set about to change how they interact with the public, with developers, and with their customers.\nOne of those changes \u2013 and the impetus for these recent articles \u2013 has been that the RTG wants to be more forthcoming about future product developments. Traditionally AMD always held their cards close to their chest about architectures, keeping them secret until the first products based on a new architecture launch (and even then sometimes not talking about matters in detail). With the RTG this is changing, and similar to competitors Intel and NVIDIA, the RTG wants to prepare developers and partners for new architectures sooner. As a result the RTG has been giving us a limited, high-level overview of their GPU plans for 2016.\nBack in December we started things off talking about RTG\u2019s plans for display technologies \u2013 DisplayPort, HDMI, Freesync, and HDR \u2013 and how the company would be laying the necessary groundwork in future architectures to support their goals for higher resolution displays, more ubiquitous Freesync-over-HDMI, and the wider color spaces and higher contrast of HDR. The second of RTG\u2019s presentations that we covered was focused on their software development plans, including Linux driver improvements and the consolidation of all of RTG\u2019s various GPU libraries and SDKs under the GPUOpen banner, which will see these resources released on GitHub as open source projects.\nLast but not least among RTG\u2019s presentations is without a doubt the most eagerly anticipated subject: the hardware. As RTG (and AMD before them) has commented on in the past couple of years, a new architecture is being developed for future RTG GPUs. Dubbed Polaris (the North Star), RTG\u2019s new architecture will be at the heart of their 2016 GPUs, and is designed for what can now be called the current-generation FinFET processes. Polaris incorporates a number of new technologies, including a 4th generation Graphics Core Next design for the heart of the GPU, and of course the new display technologies that RTG revealed last month. Finally, the first Polaris GPUs should be available in mid-2016, or roughly 6 months from now.\nFirst Polaris GPU Is Up and Running\nBut before we dive into Polaris and RTG\u2019s goals for the new architecture, let\u2019s talk about the first Polaris GPUs. With the first products expected to launch in the middle of this year, to no surprise RTG has their first GPUs back from the fab and up & running. To that end \u2013 and I am sure many of you are eager to hear about \u2013 as part of their presentation RTG showed off the first Polaris GPU in action, however briefly.\nAs a quick preface here, while RTG demonstrated a Polaris based card in action we the press were not allowed to see the physical card or take pictures of the demonstration. Similarly, while Raja Koduri held up an unsoldered version of the GPU used in the demonstration, again we were not allowed to take any pictures. So while we can talk about what we saw, at this time it\u2019s all we can do. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair to say that RTG has had issues with leaks in the past, and while they wanted to confirm to the press that the GPU was real and the demonstration was real, they don\u2019t want the public (or the competition) seeing the GPU before they\u2019re ready to show it off. That said, I do know that RTG is at CES 2016 planning to recap Polaris as part of AMD\u2019s overall presence, so we may yet see the GPU at CES after the embargo on this information has expired.\nIn any case, the GPU RTG showed off was a small GPU. And while Raja\u2019s hand is hardly a scientifically accurate basis for size comparisons, if I had to guess I would wager it\u2019s a bit smaller than RTG\u2019s 28nm Cape Verde GPU or NVIDIA\u2019s GK107 GPU, which is to say that it\u2019s likely smaller than 120mm2. This is clearly meant to be RTG\u2019s low-end GPU, and given the evolving state of FinFET yields, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this was the very first GPU design they got back from Global Foundries as its size makes it comparable to current high-end FinFET-based SoCs. In that case, it could very well also be that it will be the first GPU we see in mid-2016, though that\u2019s just supposition on my part.\nFor their brief demonstration, RTG set up a pair of otherwise identical Core i7 systems running Star Wars Battlefront. The first system contained an early engineering sample Polaris card, while the other system had a GeForce GTX 950 installed (specific model unknown). Both systems were running at 1080p Medium settings \u2013 about right for a GTX 950 on the X-Wing map RTG used \u2013 and generally hitting the 60fps V-sync limit.\nThe purpose of this demonstration for RTG was threefold: to showcase that a Polaris GPU was up and running, that the small Polaris GPU in question could offer performance comparable to GTX 950, and finally to show off the energy efficiency advantage of the small Polaris GPU over current 28nm GPUs. To that end RTG also plugged each system into a power meter to measure the total system power at the wall. In the live press demonstration we saw the Polaris system average 88.1W while the GTX 950 system averaged 150W. Meanwhile in RTG\u2019s own official lab tests (and used in the slide above) they measured 86W and 140W respectively.\nKeeping in mind that this is wall power \u2013 PSU efficiency and the power consumption of other components is in play as well \u2013 the message RTG is trying to send is clear: that Polaris should be a very power efficient GPU family thanks to the combination of architecture and FinFET manufacturing. That RTG is measuring a 54W difference at the wall is definitely a bit surprising as GTX 950 averages under 100W to begin with, so even after accounting for PSU efficiency this implies that power consumption of the Polaris video card is about half that of the GTX 950. But as this is clearly a carefully arranged demo with a framerate cap and a chip still in early development, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it at this time.",

        "title": "\u2018iPhone 5se\u2019 likely to have faster A9/M9 chips &amp; always-on Siri, but still come with a 16GB capacity",
        "body": "Last week we reported that Apple is preparing to announce a new 4-inch iPhone dubbed the \u201ciPhone 5se\u201d as soon as mid-March. Our report noted that the new iPhone is essentially an upgraded iPhone 5s with a faster processor, Apple Pay, new camera features, and curved glass edges instead of sharp chamfers. Now, we have a few additional details about this new iPhone model. First, we are told that there are different prototypes of the device floating around Apple\u2019s campus: some with the A8 and M8 chips that we discussed in our previous report, and some with the iPhone 6s\u2019s A9 and M9 processors. We\u2019ve now learned that the iPhone 5se is more likely to include variants of the A9 and M9 chips instead of the A8 and M8 lines\u2026\nBecause the iPhone 7 will include a faster chip potentially known as the A10 processor, Apple likely does not want its new 4-inch iPhone to fall two processor generations behind in just six months. Another benefit of the M9 chip from the iPhone 6s is always-on Siri activation. This feature allows a user to say \u201cHey Siri\u201d and launch Siri on their iPhone without the device being plugged in. Given the large performance leap, we are told that the \u201c5se\u201d will likely replace the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the iPhone lineup this fall when the iPhone 7 is introduced. This means that Apple\u2019s fall 2016 iPhone lineup will likely be the iPhone 5se, iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, and the future iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (or what Apple ends up calling the next-generation devices).\nLastly, we are told that the 5se will also likely see another boost over the 5s: a higher capacity. While the new device will likely start at a 16GB capacity to match the 5s, the secondary, higher capacity is said to be doubled from 32GB to 64GB. The iPhone 5s from 2013 will be discontinued upon the release of the new 5se and we are told that the price points of the 5s will be assumed by the new model. Apple is currently planning to debut the new device during the week of March 14th either via an event or online announcement. Apple is also preparing new Apple Watch models with new band colors, materials, and partnerships while an iPad Air 3 is also in development, but it is not yet clear if the new iPad is ready for a launch.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Tech companies and government access to data was one focus at the Democratic debate this week, and just days earlier Apple and Tim Cook were mentioned by name during the Republican presidential debate with candidates asked specifically about Cook\u2019s position on keeping user data private from government.\nRecent legislation proposed in at least two states \u2014 New York and California \u2014 looks to ban iPhone sales if Apple won\u2019t compromise on encryption, which shows you just how heated the debate has gotten.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "body": "If you live in an apartment complex, you\u2019ve probably noticed more than just the passive-aggressive network IDs that your neighbors use\u2014very likely you\u2019ve had problems with your wireless connections dropping out, or just not being as fast as you\u2019d like. This often has to do with the Wi-Fi channels in your area.\nIf your wireless router is on the same Wi-Fi channel as a lot of your neighbors, you\u2019ll experience a lot of interference with their networks\u2014so it\u2019s best to choose a different channel with fewer people on it. When you do, you\u2019ll reduce that interference and improve your WI-Fi signal.\nThe first step, though, is finding out which channel is least congested in your area. These tools will help you identify which nearby networks are using which channels.\nNote that Wi-Fi channels overlap with nearby channels. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the most frequently used for 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and these three are the only ones that don\u2019t overlap with each other.\nWe previously recommended inSSIDer for this on Windows, but it\u2019s become paid software. You probably don\u2019t want to pay $20 just to figure out which Wi-Fi channel is ideal, so use a free tool instead.\nXirrus Wi-Fi Inspector is very powerful, but it\u2019s a bit overkill for this. We liked NIrSoft\u2019s WifiInfoView instead \u2014 its simple interface does the job and it doesn\u2019t need any installation. Launch the tool, locate the Channel header, and click it to sort by Wi-Fi channel. Here, we can see that channel 6 looks a bit cluttered \u2014 we might want to switch to channel 1 instead.\nMac: Wireless Diagnostics\nBelieve it or not, macOS actually has this feature integrated. To access it, hold the Option key and click the Wi-Fi icon on the menu bar at the top of your screen. Select \u201cOpen Wireless Diagnostics.\u201d\nIgnore the wizard that appears. Instead, click the Window menu and select Utilities.\nSelect the Wi-Fi Scan tab and click Scan Now. The \u201cBest 2.4 GHz Channels\u201d and \u201cBest 5 GHz\u201d Channels\u201d fields will recommend the ideal Wi-Fi channels you should be using on your router.\nLinux: The iwlist Command\nYou could use a graphical app like Wifi Radar for this on Linux, but you\u2019d have to install it first. Instead, you might as well just use the terminal. The command here is installed by default on Ubuntu and other popular Linux distributions, so it\u2019s the fastest method. Don\u2019t fear the terminal!\nOpen a Terminal and run the following command:\nsudo iwlist wlan0 scan | grep \\(Channel\nRead the output of the command to see which channels are the most congested and make your decision. In the screenshot below, channel 1 looks the least congested.\nRELATED: How To Get a Better Wireless Signal and Reduce Wireless Network Interference\nIf you want to search for Wi-Fi channels on your phone instead of your PC, the easiest-to-use application we\u2019ve found is Wifi Analyzer on Android. Just install the free app from Google Play and launch it. You\u2019ll see an overview of the wireless networks in your area and which channels they\u2019re using.\nTap the View menu and select Channel rating. The app will display a list of Wi-Fi channels and a star rating \u2014 the one with the most stars in the best. The app will actually tell you which Wi-Fi channels are better for your Wi-Fi network, so you can go straight to your router\u2019s web interface and choose the ideal one.\nUpdate: We\u2019ve been informed you can do this with Apple\u2019s own AirPort Utility application. Enable and use the \u201cWi-Fi Scanner\u201d feature inside the app.\nRELATED: Jailbreaking Explained: What You Need to Know About Jailbreaking iPhones and iPads\nThis isn\u2019t possible on iPhones and iPads. Apple restricts apps from accessing this Wi-Fi data directly from the hardware, so you can\u2019t get an app like Android\u2019s Wifi Analyzer on Apple\u2019s App Store.\nIf you jailbreak, you can install an app like WiFi Explorer or WiFiFoFum from Cydia to get this functionality on your iPhone or iPad. These tools moved to Cydia after Apple booted them from the official App Store.\nYou probably wouldn\u2019t want to go through the trouble of jailbreaking just for this, so use one of the other tools here instead.\nHow to Change Your Router\u2019s Wi-Fi Channel\nRELATED: 10 Useful Options You Can Configure In Your Router's Web Interface\nOnce you\u2019ve found the least congested channel, changing the channel your router uses should be simple. First, log into your router\u2019s web interface in your web browser. Click over to the Wi-Fi settings page, locate the \u201cWi-Fi Channel\u201d option, and choose your new Wi-Fi channel. This option may be on some sort of \u201cAdvanced Settings\u201d page, too.\nRELATED: What's the Difference Between 2.4 and 5 GHz Wi-Fi (and Which Should I Use)?\nIf there are too many other nearby networks interfering with your signal, try getting a router that supports 5 GHz (like a \u201cDual Band\u201d router). 5 GHz Wi-Fi channels are farther apart and won\u2019t interfere with each other as much.",

        "title": "VMWare Fusion team laid off -- future of product uncertain",
        "body": "Updated February 2, 2016: Once you learn about our team and who we are, come take a trip down memory lane with us!\nYesterday morning, the Hosted UI team, responsible for VMware\u2019s Workstation and Fusion products, woke up to find themselves out of a job. These products, despite being award-winning and profitable, are probably not long for this world.\nI was not directly affected, in this way at least, as I had already left VMware in 2013 to work on Review Board full-time. However, many of my closest friends were, and a product I spent 9 years of my life on may have seen its last feature.\nI could talk all day about how I think we got here, losing this amazing team and these fantastic products. I could point fingers and lash out at those I blame. I could talk about how furious this all makes me.\nInstead, I\u2019m going to talk about the team and what we built \u2014 and I don\u2019t just mean our products.\nLet me tell you about our team\nI began working in Hosted UI on August 23rd, 2004, as a bright-eyed 20 year old freshly dropped out of college. Back then, it was a small team full of amazingly bright and passionate people, working days and nights to build a product they believed in.\nThe culture at that time within VMware was just so fun and energizing. People wanted to be there, and were proud of their work. Features were brainstormed over games of foosball or DDR, designs discussed over free lunches and beer bashes. In the evenings, we\u2019d order dinner in and watch Simpsons, or whatever was on.\nCompany culture changed over the years, becoming more corporate and stiff, but not Hosted UI. We\u2019d work all day, with the occasional interruption for YouTube videos or some laughs, and at night we went out and had some more. Poker nights, movie nights, video game nights. Dinners out together, sometimes several times a week.\nMany people came and went over those years. The team changed, though, for a software company, a surprising number remained until the very end. Even those that left kept in touch, joining for poker nights or dinners here or there, coming to the dunkings (if you were getting married, you were going in the pond), birthday celebrations, and reunions. We formed alumni lists and kept in touch. We hung out on IRC outside of work.\nThrough deadlines and downtimes, stresses and celebrations, our team worked and played hard. We were dedicated, passionate, and if you\u2019ll allow me, we were damn good at what we did.\nI left this team two years ago, but it hasn\u2019t really felt that way. I still saw them almost every week. Our team didn\u2019t have to be in the same building or even the same company to stay a team.\nHosted UI may no longer exist at VMware, but that\u2019s really VMware\u2019s loss. They lost one of the most dedicated teams they could ever hope for, the kind of team you can\u2019t just hire again.\nWe built some amazing products\nWorkstation\nVMware Workstation was the first VMware product (back then, it was simply known as \u201cVMware.\u201d). At a time when dot-coms dominated the Super Bowl and Amazon was all about books, VMware Workstation was letting pioneers in the Linux world virtualize their Windows desktop so they could run Microsoft Office instead of StarOffice.\nThis product evolved over the years with over 15 major releases, and more features than I can count, running on every flavor of Linux and Windows. It did this without falling prey to the bloat of most long-running products, as we focused not only on making it a more powerful product but also a more usable product.\nWorkstation made it easy to run complex development and testing scenarios, creating and working with several virtual environments all at once across any number of host computers. It integrated your virtual desktops with your host desktop. It let you take snapshots at different moments in the lifetime of your VM, and jump between them at will. It helped you catch defects in your software through remote debugging and CPU/memory record/replay capabilities, it helped you test complex network setups with virtual LAN devices, and it worked as a powerful front-end for VMware\u2019s Server, ESXi, and vSphere products. And, in the end, it also helped you simply run your Windows programs on Linux, your Linux programs on Windows, or whatever you wanted.\nInternally at VMware, Workstation was also seen as an indispensable product, helping other teams test features and devices that would eventually become selling points on the more high-end vSphere product releases. With Workstation\u2019s ease-of-install and ease-of-use, people could get set up in minutes and get right to work.\nWe loved our product. This was our baby. We took input from marketing, management, sales, customers, and so on, but in the end, we were given a lot of creative liberty over the features and design. We were also given time to address technical debt, helping to get our codebase in shape for future challenges.\nI don\u2019t know how many awards we received, but I think it was a lot. I do know that we had so many users who loved the product we poured our souls into. That meant a lot, and kept us motivated.\nIt was, let\u2019s say, a challenge getting some parts of the company to really care about the product. Workstation made a lot of money, but not the hundreds of millions the company would have preferred. This, I believe, ultimately led to yesterday\u2019s sad outcome\u2026 Still, I\u2019m very proud of what we built.\nFusion\nWorkstation was a power user product built for Linux and Windows. In 2007, its sister product, Fusion for Mac, was released. This focused more on consumer usage, helping people run Office and other Windows apps on their Mac.\nAt the time, Apple had just moved to Intel processors, and were touting the ability to dual-boot between Windows and MacOS X, using a feature called Bootcamp. Fusion offered a better way by letting you run Windows and MacOS X at the same time. It was popular amongst students who needed to run Windows software for class on their shiny new MacBooks. It was popular amongst developers who needed to run or test Windows or Linux environments while on the go.\nFusion was a very different product in some ways than Workstation, but it was also very closely related. While it didn\u2019t focus on many of the power user features that Workstation offered, it did take many of those features and reimagine them for more casual users. It also shared much of the core code that Workstation used, meaning that features could more easily be ported across and bugs fixed just once.\nFusion was a reimagining of what Workstation could have been, built for a different time and a different audience. Like Workstation, it was also built by a group of very loyal, dedicated, brilliant people, the Fusion segment of Hosted UI.\nWhile I never worked directly on Fusion, I did get to see features I built for Workstation make their way there, and watched as our users got to try them for the first time on the Mac. It wasn\u2019t the product I devoted my time to, but it was one I loved, and one I still use today.\nAnd all the others\nOur small team has built quite a lot over the years. Along with Workstation and Fusion, we\u2019ve also built:\nPlayer: A slimmed-down product for simply running and interacting with VMs, without all the UI of Workstation\nVMRC: Originally a browser plugin and an SDK for embedding virtual machines in your browser or other applications (which was transitioned to one of the teams behind ESX a couple years ago and reworked into a native VM console app launched from the browser)\nServer: A free product built from Workstation that offered remote VM hosting and management)\nWSX: A web-based service for running VMs natively in your browser from anywhere\nAppCatalyst: A developer-focused, API-driven development and testing service that works with Docker\nI\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s more, but those are the highlights.\nThese, along with Workstation and Fusion, were built by a team typically no larger than about 20 people (at any given point in time).\nWe did good.\nTime for the next adventure\nVMware lost a lot of amazing people, and will be feeling that for some time to come, once they realize what they\u2019ve done. It\u2019s a shame. As for our team, well, I think everyone will do just fine. Some of the best companies in the Silicon Valley are full of ex-VMware members, many former Hosted UI, who would probably welcome the chance to work with their teammates again.\nWorkstation, Fusion, and our other products may survive in maintenance mode, or they may disappear. They may continue under a new team. It\u2019s hard to say at this point what will happen. What I can say is that no matter what happens to them, they had an amazing run, and are something every one of us can be proud of the rest of our careers.\nAnd we can be proud of the team, the friendships, and the strong bonds we built, now and through our next adventures.\nUpdated 27-January-2016 at 23:31 PM: Wow, this went viral. As of right now, we\u2019re looking at around 40,000 unique viewers. I wrote this as a tribute for our team, and am amazed by the reaction it provoked. Everyone who loved our products and reached out to us to show your love, thank you. It means so much to us. Keep them coming!\nI want to be clear that I have not worked there in years and do not have inside knowledge on what will happen to these products. I updated part of the post to make that a little more clear. VMware claims they\u2019ll continue to exist, and I really hope that\u2019s the case. I like to think what we built will continue to live on, and I hope VMware does it justice.",

        "body": "Microsoft is bringing its Windows Phone keyboard to iOS. The software giant is currently testing an early version of the keyboard internally, and will make it available to public testers soon. Sources familiar with Microsoft's plans have revealed to The Verge that the iOS keyboard includes a special one-handed mode.\nWhile the Windows 10 Mobile keyboard also has a one-handed mode, Microsoft's iOS version is different. The one-handed mode works on each side, allowing you to use either hand to swipe letters or type on the go. Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile keyboard simply shifts to the side to create a compact keyboard, instead of the fanned key layout used in the iOS version.\nOther than the one-handed mode, the rest of Word Flow for iOS is very similar to the Windows Phone version. You can access word suggestions, emoji, and swipe letters (like Swype) to type out words. Microsoft is planning to bring Word Flow to iOS in the coming months, with an Android version expected later this year.\nThis is my next: The best keyboards for Android and iPhone",

        "body": "(Reuters) \u2013 Apple\u2019s Steve Zadesky, who has been overseeing the company\u2019s electric car project for the last two years, has said he is leaving the company, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.\nZadesky, who previously worked with the iPod and iPhone teams, is leaving for personal reasons not related to his performance, the WSJ said.\nIt was not clear when the 16-year veteran would leave Apple, the Journal said. As of Friday afternoon his profile on LinkedIn still listed him as working at Apple.\nApple declined to comment.\nApple has never acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, but the company has recruited dozens of auto experts, many from car makers like Ford or Mercedes-Benz.\nApple Chief Executive Tim Cook went to BMW\u2019s headquarters in 2014, and senior Apple executives toured the carmaker\u2019s Leipzig factory to learn how it manufactures the i3 electric car, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nThe dialogue ended without conclusion because Apple, the world\u2019s largest maker of electronic gadgets, appears to want to explore developing a passenger car on its own, one of the sources said.\nAlso, BMW, the world\u2019s biggest seller of premium cars, is being cautious about sharing its manufacturing know-how because it wants to avoid becoming a mere supplier to a software or Internet giant.\nBut one of the sources said the exploratory talks between senior managers might be revived.\n(Reporting by Rama Venkat Raman in Bengaluru; Editing by Mary Milliken and Stephen R.
