        "body": "An 11-inch iPad Pro exhibits a bend out of the box. | Source: The Verge\nA slightly bent chassis may not impede the new iPad Pro from working right, but Apple implying that this happening in any quantity to end-users is okay in any way defies reason.\nContrary to appearances, I don't work all day and all night. So, when I hit the headlines this morning and was confronted with an array of testimonies talking about how some of Apple's customers with a new iPad Pro were taking them out of the box pre-bent, that took a few reads to fully process.\nWe've spoken about Apple's quality assurance at some length, just a hair over a year ago. We still don't think that there need to be mass firings, or sacrificial executives laid at the altar \u2014 but this iPad Pro situation isn't good, and harkens back to G4 Cube mold marks, and a few other issues from days of yore. Yes, even Steve Jobs had issues like this.\nIt's early on Thursday, but we've already looked at our continued collation of service data, spoken to a few Apple dealers, and to other staff inside Apple not authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Based on service data and return rates, this does not appear to be a widespread or endemic problem. However, the fact that somebody at Apple has spoken out about it means it is not a trivial amount of customers who could be easily and quietly handled by being given a replacement with a perfunctory \"hey, look at that\" by Genius Bar staff before before anybody catches wind of the issue.\nAppleInsider's advice is this: open those iPads you've got under the tree, and check them right now, to make sure that it isn't bent prior to any use by the recipient. Take advantage of that generous holiday return period that Apple is currently offering, and get one that's not bent and don't stop until you get one.\nIf you've got an older unit from launch, you might be out of luck. If you think it was bent out of the box, calmly and politely talk to Apple about it, get a case number, and keep watching AppleInsider for more information on it going forward. Remember, you aren't talking to factory workers or engineers, and they had nothing to do with the current situation \u2014 so screaming at them isn't going to help you, or make them want to solve your problem. Of course, if you bent it, that's a different matter altogether, and please don't go down this road.",

        "title": "In 2019, Apple needs to change iPhone\u2019s call UI because robocalls are killing us",
        "body": "Right now, any robocall hacker in the world can instantly take over your phone\u2019s screen, knocking you out of your mobile gaming experience, disrupting you as you check out at the store, or breaking your concentration as you try and type out an email.\nAnd disrupt they do, at a massive scale. Several billion fake calls are received each month in the US. Reports show this is a global problem, with Brazilians averaging 37 spam calls per month. Actually, I\u2019m getting a robocall as I type this very sentence, my second today.\nAt the telelphony-infrastructure level, it\u2019s a supremely difficult problem that lacks a short-term fix because the underlying protocol is hopelessly insecure.\nBut from a user-experience perspective, there\u2019s a simple way to make things more manageable. Apple should let incoming calls show up as a banner notification, not a full screen alert.\nWhat was magical in 2007 has become a major annoyance\nIt\u2019s absolutely bonkers that millions of smartphone users get their full screen taken over by robocallers on a daily basis. Tapping Decline is not a great option because it actually tells the robocaller that you\u2019re with your phone and are annoyed by the call, information I\u2019d rather not give.\nThe jailbreak community for iOS saw this need years ago, and an app called CallReply tweaked the phone UI to let incoming calls appear as banner notifications.\nWhen will Apple follow suit?\nOne commenter on Hacker News pointed out: \u201cThis annoyance is three-fold when a call from your iPhone also takes over your iPad screen and rings on your MacBook.\u201d[1] Fair point!\nAnother exclaims there\u2019s lack of call filtering options available in iOS, I completely agree \u2013 as blocking individual numbers is totally ineffective in blocking robocall spam. \u201cI would love to be able to block all numbers coming from my area code and the first 3 digits of my number.. all my robo calls come from a number that looks just like mine.\u201d [2]\nAnother points out, the carriers could taking some steps to limit robocalls, but may be dragging their feet because it\u2019s (arguably) in their commercial interests to let it flourish. While I agree there\u2019s a lot more the carriers could be doing to flag \u201cinauthentic\u201d behavior of network participants, the root cause of SS7\u2019s lack of authentication and encryption will remain. But yes, carriers are definitely on the hook for making things better too. [3]\nYet another commenter remarks about how Google has dealt with this issue: \u201cFwiw, Android actually does do this. When the phone is unlocked, calls show up as a banner. In addition, they added that new call screening option, I\u2019ve been using it and so far it has worked fairly well. Also, there is some built-in call filtering and third party apps as well, though I have mostly been able to rely on the built-in filtering. Does iOS really not have any options for filtering? I swear last time I had an iPhone (running iOS9) there was Something\u2026 but then again, I was jailbroken. It\u2019s a bit funny that we got full web browsers on phones before proper call filtering. (Disclaimer: I work for Google but not on phones.)\u201d [4]",

        "title": "Apple confirms some iPad Pros ship slightly bent, but says it\u2019s normal",
        "body": "Apple has confirmed to The Verge that some of its 2018 iPad Pros are shipping with a very slight bend in the aluminum chassis. But according to the company, this is a side effect of the device\u2019s manufacturing process and shouldn\u2019t worsen over time or negatively affect the flagship iPad\u2019s performance in any practical way. Apple does not consider it to be a defect.\nThe bend is the result of a cooling process involving the iPad Pro\u2019s metal and plastic components during manufacturing, according to Apple. Both sizes of the new iPad Pro can exhibit it. The iPad Pro ranges in price from $799 for the base 11-inch model up to $1,899 for a fully-loaded 12.9-inch device with 1TB of storage and LTE connectivity.\nThe response comes after some customers on social media and several on the MacRumors forums have claimed their iPad Pros developed a small curve or bend without any mistreatment or abnormal stress being exerted on the metal casing. There are posts from people who believe it happened gradually over the course of normal, everyday use \u2014 or after transporting the iPad Pro in a backpack. And I\u2019ve seen others from folks who are insistent their iPad came that way out of the box.\nApple is now saying that in some cases, the latter is true. And I can personally vouch for that: my 11-inch iPad Pro showed a bit of a curve after two weeks. Apple asked if I would send it their way so the engineering team could take a look. But the replacement 11-inch iPad Pro I received at Apple\u2019s Downtown Brooklyn store exhibited a very slight bend in the aluminum as soon as I took off the wrapper.\nAn 11-inch iPad Pro exhibited a very slight bend right out of the box.\nIt\u2019s an issue that seems to be more common on the LTE model, as there\u2019s a plastic strip that breaks up the iPad\u2019s flat aluminum sides; it\u2019s where the antenna line divides two sections of metal that some users have noticed a bend. Apple did not say the perceived flaw is strictly limited to the cellular iPad Pro, however. Some buyers of the Wi-Fi model also claim to have bent units, but many are straight as designed. Even if only cosmetic, the issue is out of character for Apple, which has rooted its reputation in manufacturing devices with best-in-industry fit and finish.\nThose who are annoyed by the bend shouldn\u2019t have any trouble exchanging or returning their iPad Pro at the Apple Store or other retailers within the 14-day return window. But it\u2019s not clear if swaps will be permitted outside that policy. I\u2019ve asked Apple if it has communicated with stores about the issue, as I\u2019ve read some accounts of employees telling people it\u2019s accidental damage and warrants an AppleCare+ claim (and deductible) to replace. That shouldn\u2019t be the case for a slight bend. Apple also says it has not seen a higher-than-normal return rate for the 2018 iPad Pro so far.\nThis controversy arose after a viral video from JerryRigEverything saw the popular YouTuber fold the newest iPad Pro in half with seemingly very little effort. Some have criticized the video as a stunt for views and as biased against Apple. Most tablets \u2014 both from Apple and other companies \u2014 will bend if you intend on bending them. They\u2019re thin devices with a lot of surface area. The 11-inch iPad Pro weighs barely over one pound. And two months in, I haven\u2019t seen any reports of iPad Pros failing as a result of the manufacturing quirk or bending to anywhere near the same catastrophic degree as that video. Apple says that concerns over the iPad Pro\u2019s structural rigidity are unfounded and that it stands by the product.\nApple says that concerns over the iPad Pro\u2019s structural rigidity are unfounded",

To the left of the main screen is the \"My Shazam\" area, where the app keeps a list of all the songs you have Shazamed recently. To the right of the main screen is Shazam's \"Discover\" tab with artist, song, and playlist recommendations, user posts, friend Shazams, and more.\nShazam finally going ad-free comes one year after Apple first announced its plans to acquire Shazam back in December 2017. At the time, Apple said, \"Apple Music and Shazam are a natural fit,\" and that the two companies \"have exciting plans in store.\" In September 2018, Apple completed the acquisition and said that the Shazam app would become ad-free soon.\nIn October 2018, Shazam began informing its users about the Apple acquisition and aligning its data privacy policies with those of Apple.

Still, it was obvious that Jobs wanted Apple to keep moving on in his spirit, which meant both thinking independently and sweating details.\nOne of Jobs\u2019 most legendary characteristics was an extreme form of perfectionism, which biographer Walter Isaacson explained had been deeply implanted by Jobs\u2019 father. \u201cIt was important, his father said, to craft the backs of cabinets and fences properly, even though they were hidden,\u201d Isaacson said in Jobs\u2019 biography. As they looked at one of those fences together, Jobs told Isaacson that his father \u201cloved doing things right. He even cared about the look of the parts you couldn\u2019t see.\u201d\nThere are plenty of examples of how that perfectionism played out during Jobs\u2019 life, including computers manufactured with exacting angles or engraved interiors, iPhone boxes changed because of how the letter \u201cS\u201d looked, and the last-minute extended delay of the white iPhone 4 because of problems with its new coloration. Many other stories, including how Jobs and acolyte Scott Forstall obsessed over the pixels of iOS icons, confirm that Apple cared more deeply about making its products perfect \u2014 or as close as it could come at the time \u2014 than most customers realized.\nThat\u2019s why a report this week from The Verge was so rattling to those of us who have been following Apple for years. Confronted with mounting photographic evidence from customers and journalists, Apple confirmed that some of its latest iPad Pros are arriving bent in the box. When a Verge writer returned his own bent iPad to an Apple Store, the replacement he received was bent, too.\nPause and consider that all for a moment. We\u2019re not talking about the back of a fence, the interior of a cabinet, or the paint inside an iPhone. This is the clearly visible external shape of a manufactured object, not complying with the straight lines depicted in numerous places across Apple\u2019s own website.\nBut lest you think that Apple actually admitted that there was a problem with one of its products, it didn\u2019t. As our own Emil Protalinski put it, Apple acknowledged the bending, but claimed that bent metal isn\u2019t a defect. Instead, it said that the bend was a result of the manufacturing process, and effectively normal.\nAt a time when daily news is being filled with \u201calternate facts\u201d and other attempts to blur \u201ctruth\u201d from \u201clie,\u201d there\u2019s still a sniff test for whether something reeks of falsehood: common sense. Any first-time iPad customer who was given an opportunity to lay a new iPad on a flat surface would question bent metal \u2014 and be right to do so. This iPad wasn\u2019t designed or marketed with a curved back.\nAs hard as this might be to believe, I don\u2019t think what we\u2019re seeing is a DNA-level problem with Apple. The company still obsesses over the form of its products, thanks in part to Jony Ive\u2019s industrial design team, but also others \u2014 including Cook and COO Jeff Williams \u2014 who demand supply chain excellence. These people and their processes aren\u2019t perfect, but they strive for it. In the years since Jobs\u2019 passing, we have seen Apple devices that bend under stress, but we haven\u2019t seen other devices arriving bent in the box, or Apple brushing that off as the new normal.\nMy gut feeling is that the issue is largely with how Apple\u2019s communications and legal teams have been taught to defend the company\u2019s brand, most likely dating back to the Jobs era. When customers report a problem, Apple\u2019s standard response has been to portray it as isolated, small, and certainly not worthy of a broad response or recall. By maintaining that Apple did nothing (or almost nothing) wrong, the company\u2019s representatives believe they\u2019re stopping Apple stores and telephone lines from being flooded with requests for replacements.\nBut that\u2019s not the right approach when there\u2019s something clearly wrong with the way something looks out of the box, or how it works after a short period of regular use. Consider the \u201cbutterfly keyboard\u201d saga that affected MacBook laptops. Apple ignored or downplayed stuck key issues across multiple machines, and only acknowledged the problem when it was ready to release something new. By that time, it had to deal with both angry customers and lawsuits.\nIt shouldn\u2019t take that level of anger or threatened litigation to do something as simple as swapping a bent iPad for one that\u2019s not bent. Despite recently losing $250 million in market value, Apple still isn\u2019t hard up for cash. And no consumer electronics company, let alone a luxury brand, should ever be so stingy that it expects customers to accept bent goods as normal just because the factory gave them a pass.\nA handful of bent iPads isn\u2019t a big enough deal to make the list of Apple\u2019s most noteworthy highs and lows for 2018, and I suspect that customers with obviously bent-out-of-box devices will be able to get them swapped at Apple Stores \u2014 an issue Apple will then quietly address with both its suppliers and designers. Just like Apple\u2019s past aluminum alloy and internal reinforcement changes for iPhones, the next iPad Pros will likely be stronger than current models, and that\u2019s the way it goes: Products are supposed to get better over time.\nBut if Apple thinks that normalizing obvious manufacturing problems with its products is the right way to deal with issues, that strikes me as the very opposite of the way Steve Jobs (at least, on a good day) would handle the situation, and moreover, not doing \u201cwhat\u2019s right.\u201d A customer shouldn\u2019t be asked to accept a brand new product that\u2019s dented. Regardless of whether the problem is small or a manufacturing partner\u2019s fault, it\u2019s time for Apple to admit that something needs to change in the way it responds to issues like this, lest more serious problems \u2014 such as more angry customers, lawsuits, and bad press \u2014 continue to dog the company in 2019.",

        "title": "Apple to use new touch-integrated OLED screens to make 2019 iPhone thinner and lighter",
        "body": "A supply-chain report says that Apple will be using a new form of screen technology to make at least one of its 2019 iPhone models thinner and lighter \u2014 a trend Apple has bucked with recent flagship versions.\nThe report says that Apple has decided to use touch-integrated flexible OLED panels, which have a different construction to current iPhone screens \u2026\nCurrent screens use a separate touch-sensitive layer sitting on top of the display itself. By integrating touch-sensitivity into the OLED screen, it will allow devices to be somewhat thinner and lighter.\nETNews says that the technology, branded Y-Octa, will be made by Samsung.\nSamsung Display will supply touch-integrated flexible organic light emitting diode (OLED) panels to Apple\u2019s iPhone. It is a Samsung OLED called \u2018Y-OCTA\u2019. It\u2019s the first time Apple has applied touch-integrated displays to the iPhone [\u2026] According to industry sources today, Apple decided to apply touch-integrated flexible OLED panels to the new iPhone and commissioned the development and manufacturing from Samsung Display. Samsung Display recently entered into partnerships with related companies to develop parts and materials to make the displays.\nThe report claims that the technology should be ready for use next year, but says that initial supplies will be constrained, suggesting that the new screens might be used only in next year\u2019s highest-end model. However, as the tech is expected to be cheaper than a separate touch-sensitive layer, it is likely to be rolled out into all models as capacity increases in future years.\nSamsung is reported to have first pitched the idea to Apple in March as a way of retaining the company\u2019s OLED orders. Samsung is currently the exclusive supplier of OLED panels for the iPhone X and iPhone XS/XS Max, but Apple has been working to bring LG on board as a second supplier.\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "We\u2019re No Longer in Smartphone Plateau. We\u2019re in the Smartphone Decline.",
        "body": "The days of double-digit smartphone growth are over \u2014 and the next decade may start to see smartphone sales decline. Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nFrom roughly 2007 until 2013, the smartphone market grew at an astonishing pace, posting double-digit growth year after year, even during a global recession. They were the good years, the type that would inspire a Scorsese montage: millions and then billions of smartphones going out; billions and then trillions of dollars in rising company valuations; every year new models of phones hitting the market, held up triumphantly at events that were part sales pitch, part tent revival. (To nail the Scorsese effect, imagine \u201cJumpin\u2019 Jack Flash\u201d playing while you think about it.)\nBut just like every Scorsese movie, the party ends. Smartphone growth began to slow starting in 2013 or 2014. In 2016, it was suddenly in the single digits, and in 2017 global smartphone shipments, for the first time, actually declined \u2014 fewer smartphones were sold than in 2017 than in 2016.\nEvery smartphone manufacturer is now facing a world where, at best, they can hope for single-digit growth in smartphone sales \u2014 and many seem to be preparing for a world where they face declines.\nThe Smartphone Plateau\nThe idea of a \u201csmartphone plateau\u201d has been floating around since at least 2012, with the phrase entering common usage in the middle of this decade. It has a twofold meaning. One is the slowdown in smartphone innovation, which was once progressing at that same breakneck pace as smartphone sales. If you bought a new iPhone 3G in 2008, and then a new iPhone 4 in 2010, you were buying markedly different machines, with the iPhone 4 sporting a Retina display, a much better battery, a faster processor, and a sleek, sharp-edged design. If you bought an iPhone 6 in 2014 and then an iPhone 7 in 2016, that expected improvement was much harder to mark (except, perhaps for that fact the the iPhone 7 didn\u2019t have a 3.5mm headphone jack). The other meaning is the flattening of smartphone sales.\nWe\u2019re already fairly far along this plateau \u2014 from 2015 to 2017, global smartphone shipments have held firm at about 1.4 billion per year \u2014 but talking to analysts and reading the tea leaves of what the major manufacturers are doing, it\u2019s looking like we\u2019re reaching the end. Not because sales are picking up again, but because we\u2019re heading toward the downslope. \u201cI think we\u2019re well over the plateau,\u201d says Ben Stanton, senior analyst at Canalys. \u201cWe\u2019ll see little pockets of growth in the global market, but on the whole it\u2019s a declining picture.\u201d\nIn 2017, per the International Data Corporation, global shipments of smartphones declined year-over-year for the first time in history. In 2018, IDC says the same thing happened in the U.S. market. \u201cWe are at market saturation rates of 90 to 100 percent in many developed markets,\u201d says Ryan Reith, program vice-president at IDC.\nIllustration: Jake Swearingen/Intelligencer\nIllustration: Jake Swearingen/Intelligencer\nSome manufacturers and analysts may hope that flat sales in the developed world could be offset by strong sales in other markets. Fat chance. The markets where smartphone saturation hasn\u2019t set in yet \u2014 such as India, Southeast Asia, pockets of Latin America, and Africa \u2014 are different than the markets that fueled the first decade of smartphone growth. \u201cIn those markets, there are extremely competitive devices down near the equivalent of $200,\u201d says Stanton. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a real battlefield, but it\u2019s a low-margin business and consumers down at the those price points tend to be not very brand-centric. That really plays into hands of a few really hyperaggressive brands of smartphones, most of which are coming from China.\u201d\nThe Artificial Replacement Cycle\nIf you\u2019ve bought flagship phone in this year, you likely won\u2019t need to buy a replacement until the next decade. \u201cMost people have more phone than they can handle, or need,\u201d says Gartner senior principal analyst Tuong Nguyen. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to what you saw in the PC market for while \u2014 people had really powerful PCs but they barely used it for anything. It\u2019s the same with phones.\u201d\nYour smartphone camera is good to great, and you mainly share those photos on social media, where photo quality doesn\u2019t matter much anyway. Barring a few high-end 3-D games or technologies like augmented reality, your processor can handle everything you throw at it, and will for a while. Your screen is bright and sharp, and while there may be slightly better screens out there, you\u2019d only be able to tell by holding the two phones side-by-side. Durability has vastly improved; waterproofing is now standard on smartphones, so a brief dip in the sink or toilet doesn\u2019t mean you need a new phone, and the weakest links in smartphone hardware \u2014 batteries which tend lose their ability to hold a charge over time and screens that crack and shatter \u2014 have improved.\nStill, we tend to replace our phone every two years, regardless. A lot of this has to do with how cell phones were sold in the U.S. for a number of years. Carriers signed customers to two-year contracts, and sold phones at a subsidy priced into the contract. Every 18 to 24 months, you\u2019d be able to upgrade to a new phone again. It felt natural, like the change of seasons or the migration of birds. But that cycle was artificial. Even as two-year contracts have died, carriers rarely talk about the flat price of a phone, but instead break that price out over 24 months, making it relatively easy to keep consumers buying high-end phones. A phone that costs an extra $100 total is only about $4 more per month on a financing plan \u2014 the price, as the saying goes, of a cup of coffee. \u201cThe U.S. operators did a good job working in the transition,\u201d says Reith of IDC. \u201cEven though when you look at it objectively, it got worse for the consumer.\u201d\nIllustration: Jake Swearingen/Intelligencer\nThe results of this are stark. Per IDC, 43 percent of phones sold in the U.S. in 2017 cost over $600 (and 19 percent of those cost more than $800). Another 40 percent of phones sold cost less than $200, nearly all of those prepaid phones sold through vendors like MetroPCS. Just 15 percent of phones sold cost between $200 and $600 dollars. \u201cThe middle price band is nonexistent,\u201d says Reith. The current U.S. cell phone market could be compared to an auto market in which the majority of consumers either bought a Mercedes or a Kia, and brands like Honda essentially didn\u2019t exist.\nDespite all this, there\u2019s no doubt that the replacement cycle for phones is elongating. \u201cOver the last five years, the replacement cycles of smartphones in the U.S. has has increased from an average of 20.6 to 24.1 months,\u201d says Jennifer Chan, global insight director at Kantar. More worrying for smartphone manufacturers is that desire for new technology doesn\u2019t really spur consumers to buy new phones. \u201cThe number-one purchase trigger is \u2018My last device was broken,\u2019 and this has increased year on year,\u201d says Chan. \u201cTriggers like \u2018I just wanted a newer model\u2019 and \u2018I had the option to upgrade early\u2019 have declined or remained flat.\u201d\nTrying to Delay Commoditization\nAs the market reaches maturity, smartphones are verging on becoming a commodity \u2014 a fate the major smartphone manufacturers like Samsung and Apple desperately want to avoid.\n\u201cCommoditization is the normal cycle for most products,\u201d says Willy Shih, a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School. \u201cWhen the first Xerox plain-paper copier came out, they were really cool and Xerox became a fabulously successful company. But then their patents expired, and other companies like Canon came in and introduced low-cost office copiers. Now, copier machines are a dirt-order commodity.\u201d Think very hard about your own office \u2014 can you name the brand of your office copier?\nOr take televisions, another commodity where consumers show little brand loyalty, allowing for upstarts like Vizio, TLC, and Hisense to strip market share away from established players like Sony or Panasonic \u2014 which, of course, had displaced established players in television like Magnavox or RCA.\n\u201cOnce you get driven into the commodity space, you start to think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve just got gotta come up with the next great feature that will cause people to buy my product over the others,\u2019\u201d says Shih. \u201cBut at some point, you way exceed what consumers need or are willing to pay for. And then you become a commodity.\u201d\nSamsung is in the most danger of this happening. While the brand has loyalists to its Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series of phones, Samsung phones are, at the end of day, Android devices. And there are signs that desperation is starting to set in. The company plans to release a foldable phone this spring, possibly called the Galaxy Fold, with use case that\u2019s hard to discern and a price point rumored to be $2,000. It\u2019s the type of desperation move you saw from TV manufacturers in the beginning of the decade, where they hoped that first 3-D televisions and then curved TV sets would spur consumers to spend more. Both strategies failed for television manufacturers, and it seems likely that Samsung\u2019s foldable won\u2019t end up being much more than a tech curio.\nMeanwhile, Samsung may be losing the battle in low-cost global markets. \u201cSamsung has been quite arrogant in the past 18 months,\u201d says Canalys senior analyst Ben Stanton. \u201cThey believe their brand is strong enough to offset the impact of commoditization, and that has proved not to be the case if you look at the rapid expansion of [Chinese brands] across India, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.\u201d These brands may be unfamiliar to American consumers \u2014 Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and Transsion are all major players \u2014 but if there are countries where double-digit growth is still possible, it will likely be these companies that enjoy it.\nHow Long Can Apple Defy Gravity?\nWhile the rest of the smartphone market worries about commodification and what each brand will need to do to gain or defend market share in a world where smartphones are like cars, Apple stands alone. \u201cApple has a different set of options available to it,\u201d says David Yoffie, a professor of international business at Harvard Business School who also sits on the board of HTC. \u201cThey have this extraordinary user base that allows them to do things other firms could never get away with.\u201d\nThe iPhone is uniquely positioned in two ways, one that works for it and one that works against it. In markets like the U.S. or some European countries, where the iPhone enjoys significant market share, iOS and its ecosystem are a true differentiator. If you want a phone that can use Messages and avoid the dreaded green bubble when texting people, there\u2019s only one manufacturer available: Apple. The same goes if you want to use a HomePod or an Apple TV, or want a phone that integrates easily with your MacBook.\nBut globally, iOS isn\u2019t as attractive. In the Chinese market, an app called WeChat is practically an operating system unto itself, allowing users to do everything from message someone else to pay their electrical bill or order food. And WeChat runs equally well on Android or iOS, meaning the iPhone has consistently struggled to find a foothold in the Chinese marketplace. In other markets, messaging apps like WhatsApp are dominant, and phone price is much more of a concern. The results are stark. In the U.S., about 40 percent of phones run iOS. Globally, that number is just 14 percent.\nStill, Apple has a firm grip on a large and affluent share of the U.S. market, and Tim Cook and his executive team have a clearly developed long-term strategy to deal with a world where people buy fewer phones: Make the phones themselves more expensive (thus the iPhone X at $999, followed by the iPhone XS Max at $1,099), and attempt to boost services revenue (everything from Apple Music to iCloud storage to Apple Pay to the 30 percent Apple rakes in from any App Store purchase) as quickly as possible, with the goal of bringing in $20 billion a year by 2020.\nBut its strategy of slowly raising its average selling price while selling fewer phones has a natural limit. \u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous path,\u201d says Shih, \u201cbecause when you lose the volume, then you lose a lot of the manufacturing efficiencies and some of the cost benefits.\u201d Moreover, for Apple to be successful in replacing lost revenue with its services division, it still needs a large number of iOS users. Raising the average selling price is effective in the short term, but may backfire in the long term. \u201cApple will exhaust that strategy,\u201d says Yoffie. \u201cWhen Apple is at an average selling price of $800, and the rest of industry is at $300, you can only defy gravity for so long.\u201d\nThere are already signs of investor worry. Apple surprised everyone during its earnings call in early November when it announced it would no longer release how many phones it sold each quarter. This news was taken as tacit acknowledgment by Apple that it doesn\u2019t anticipate ever selling more phones than it sold in a previous year, and its stock price plummeted since, taking the company\u2019s valuation back below a trillion dollars, part of the overall slump in tech stocks that has acted as a major drag on the stock market overall.\nIt\u2019s a good reminder of just how large the smartphone market is overall \u2014 global smartphone sales accounted for nearly $500 billion in revenue in 2017, and there are a host of ancillary businesses built out to support that market, from companies in the supply chain to operations that make smartphone cases. If we truly are entering a period of declining smartphone sales, the ripples of that decline will be felt on many shores.\nYour Phone Is a Car Now\nBut what [local newscaster voice] does this mean for you?\nWith phones that are more reliable, have fewer changes every year, and are increasingly expensive, you should treat your phone like a car. If some jerk clips off your side-view mirror while you\u2019re parked and doesn\u2019t leave a note, you don\u2019t trash your car and get a new one \u2014 you get a new side-view mirror. If you crack your phone\u2019s screen, don\u2019t get a new phone, get a new screen.\nAnd when your phone truly does run its course, whether because you simply want something newer and faster, or your old phone has finally stopped working, consider avoiding the newest phone on the market. Relatively few people buy new cars, because it doesn\u2019t make much sense financially. Instead, most people, even those with who could buy new, buy a used car.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean turning to the secondhand market for smartphones, which is still developing and prone to problems (though it\u2019s not impossible to see that market grow more over the next decade). Instead, consider buying a smartphone one year behind the newest model. A Google Pixel 3 is a fantastic phone that sells, as of this writing, for $799. A Google Pixel 2 is also an extremely good phone with slightly fewer features, and sells for $649. One year, $150 less for a phone that, unless you are a true gadget nerd, you will not notice much of a difference. The iPhone market follows much of the same rules \u2014 the iPhone XR, the cheapest phone Apple released this year, is a fantastic phone that costs $749. The iPhone 8, still a superb machine, can be had for $599.\nLooking forward, there is no device that seems poised to replace the smartphone as the machine at the center of most of our digital lives. The wearables seem to be a niche market at best, smart speakers will likely remain only in our homes, and something like always-on wearable AR is decades away from being a reality. For consumers, this means a world where you hold on to your phone for longer and longer, which is good for your pocketbook and good for the environment.\nFor manufacturers, the next decade will likely be a great shakeout, with some old guard names leaving the market, some newer brands becoming ascendant, and the winners acquiring and stripping the losers for parts. But manufacturer loss is consumer gain; the main differentiator in a mature market where commoditization has fully taken hold is one that should be appealing to anyone who shops for a smartphone: price. Behind the scenes there may be a bloodbath, but you\u2019ll simply notice that you\u2019re getting a lot more phone for a lot less money.",

In a rather cringey skit with Julia Roberts, Ellen DeGeneres announces to the crowd that they are all getting the brand new iPhone.\nThe Ellen Show always does 12 days of giveaways for the holiday season but never before has Apple participated in what are essentially paid promotional segments. You can watch the 3-minute sequence below.\nEllen starts by playing the App Store game Heads Up on \u2018her\u2019 iPhone XR and then the pair take a Portrait Mode selfie. Roberts says \u2018I think it\u2019s cool because it comes in six different colors and has the best battery life ever\u2019 which then leads into Ellen announcing that every audience member is going home with an iPhone XR of their own.\nThe YouTube description says \u2018Special thanks to: Apple IPhone XR\u2019 (yes, with that capitalization) so Apple was definitely involved in the promotion/ad.",

        "body": "We have already seen Apple aggressively promote trade in bonuses, moves that the company does not typically make in the wake of the release of new iPhones. However, it seems like Apple is working harder than ever to push unit sales this time around.\nBloomberg reports that Apple told some marketing staff to put their work on hold and switch to focusing on iPhone marketing, another sign that iPhone XS and iPhone XR sales are not as strong.\nThe Apple.com homepage in the US currently features a \u2018limited time\u2019 banner promoting a \u2018$449 iPhone XR\u2019 deal, which requires a trade-in of an iPhone 7 Plus. It is rare for the Apple homepage to show any prices or dollar amounts.\nVia Bloomberg:\nCompany executives moved some marketing staff from other projects to work on bolstering sales of the latest handsets in October, about a month after the iPhone XS went on sale and in the days around the launch of the iPhone XR, according to a person familiar with the situation. This person described it as a \u201cfire drill,\u201d and a possible admission that the devices may have been selling below some expectations. The person asked not to be identified discussing private strategy changes.\nOne thing that we noticed is that Apple has updated its homepage marketing with more oblique descriptions of the new features inside the iPhone XR and the iPhone XS. Previously, Apple.com would show the one-line marketing slogans with Learn More links. Since the weekend update, it now lists the flagship features of the phones explicitly, like the best-in-class battery life of the iPhone XR.\nSupply chain reports of weak iPhone sales are almost a meme at this point, with stories popping up about this time every year. This year seems particularly extreme. Many iPhone component suppliers have reported revenue warnings to investors citing market weakness. We even saw $100 price drops in Japan at carriers, where demand for iPhone XR was reported to be particularly low.\nApple\u2019s own guidance for the holiday quarter was reasonably high ($89-$94bn) but lower than many analyst expectations. The company also announced that it will stop reporting device unit sales, which did not inspire confidence. AAPL stock has fallen in recent weeks as investors fear sales for the mid-cycle quarters will fall significantly.",

        "body": "The AirPods truly-wireless earbuds are on track to be Apple\u2019s best growth product for the foreseeable future, according to Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo said that Apple will release an \u201cupgraded model with wireless charging support\u201d in the first quarter of 2019.\nKuo also said an all-new design for AirPods is currently on track to launch in early 2020 \u2026\nKuo forecasts dramatic unit growth for AirPods with units rising from 16 million units in 2017 to over 100 million by 2021. He calls them Apple\u2019s most popular accessory ever.\nHe indicates that existing iPhone users are more likely to buy AirPods than upgrade their phone itself.\nKuo refers to the 1Q2019 update as a \u2018model with wireless charging support\u2019, which at first sounds like the wireless charging case Apple originally announced with the AirPower mat in September 2017.\nHe goes on to say that the new AirPods case will have a \u2018rigid-flex board\u2019 internal component upgrade, which will be more expensive to manufacture. The hinge of the charging case will also be redesigned to support appearance changes and higher thermal requirements, and the cost of that component will rise by ~60%.\nThe infamous marketing image of the AirPower mat, featuring the AirPods wireless charging case.\nInterestingly, Kuo also says that the new AirPods will have upgrades to the Bluetooth spec. This seems to suggest that the AirPods themselves will be getting an upgrade, alongside the case. It sounds like that Apple will fulfil its original promise of selling the AirPods wireless charging case as a separate add-on accessory for existing AirPods owners, and release a minor revision to the whole product at the same time \u2014 which includes the wireless charging case.\nKuo does not go into detail about what the \u2018all-new design\u2019 2020 AirPods will feature. Previous rumors have suggested features like sweat resistance, Hey Siri integration and more.\nKuo did not mention the AirPower mat at all in today\u2019s report, despite the obvious link between the AirPods case and the seemingly-dead-or-delayed Apple charging mat. For what it is worth, in an October report, Kuo said he that expected new AirPods and AirPower in late 2018 or early 2019.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Super Micro audit complete, including servers supplied to Apple: no spy chips found",
        "body": "The tech news was dominated in October by a dramatic Bloomberg claim that Chinese spy chips had been embedded into the Super Micro motherboards of servers supplied to Apple, Amazon and others. The report claimed that Apple had discovered the chips, and reported the fact to the FBI.\nAll involved \u2013 Apple, Amazon and Super Micro \u2013 denied the claims, but the motherboard supplier decided the only way to lay this to rest was to commission an independent audit to investigate. That investigation has now been completed, and the firm says it found absolutely no evidence to support the story \u2026\nReuters reports that Super Micro today advised its customers of the results of the third-party audit.\nComputer hardware maker Super Micro Computer Inc told customers on Tuesday that an outside investigations firm had found no evidence of any malicious hardware in its current or older-model motherboards. In a letter to customers, the San Jose, California, company said it was not surprised by the result of the review it commissioned in October [\u2026] A person familiar with the analysis told Reuters it had been conducted by global firm Nardello & Co and that customers could ask for more detail on that company\u2019s findings.\nNardello specifically tested samples of the motherboards supplied to Apple and Amazon, alongside current versions, and found no evidence of spy chips in any of them. The company also checked design files and software, to see if there was evidence of tampering with either, but found nothing there either.\nThere were immediate reasons to doubt the story when it first appeared. It appeared to be poorly sourced, with no detail on how the supposed chip worked. The technical arguments against the claim seemed strong. And there were three problems with the theory that Apple was lying about it.\nApple doesn\u2019t just deny the specific claim, it says that nothing like it has ever happened [\u2026] Apple has specifically stated that it is not under a gag order [\u2026] Third, the value of keeping quiet about any Chinese spy chip was completely lost once Bloomberg posted its story. If it was true, the Chinese government would know that the gig was up, and there would be no value in Apple, Amazon or the US government maintaining their silence. Apple could simply issue a statement saying something like \u2018yes, this happened; we detected it; we were asked to keep quiet about it; we took steps to ensure no genuine customer data was leaked.\u2019\nMore reasons quickly emerged. The Department of Homeland Security, the NSA and the UK\u2019s NSA equivalent GCHQ all backed the denials; Apple repeated its denial to Congress (an insane thing for a company to do if it were lying); a leading security researcher who had been specifically seeking out evidence for this type of attack was unable to find any; and one of Bloomerg\u2019s own sources told them prior to publication that the story made no sense.\nA deep-dive technical analysis later said that the claimed attack would have been impossible at Apple, and CEO Tim Cook called on Bloomberg to retract its story \u2013 getting only silence in response.\nSuper Micro is said to be reviewing its legal options.\nImage: Shutterstock\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Your Apps Know Where You Were Last Night, and They\u2019re Not Keeping It Secret -- 200 Apple Apps Send Your Exact Location to Advertisers",
        "body": "Dozens of companies use smartphone locations to help advertisers and even hedge funds. They say it\u2019s anonymous, but the data shows how personal it is.\nThe millions of dots on the map trace highways, side streets and bike trails \u2014 each one following the path of an anonymous cellphone user.\nOne path tracks someone from a home outside Newark to a nearby Planned Parenthood, remaining there for more than an hour. Another represents a person who travels with the mayor of New York during the day and returns to Long Island at night.\nYet another leaves a house in upstate New York at 7 a.m. and travels to a middle school 14 miles away, staying until late afternoon each school day. Only one person makes that trip: Lisa Magrin, a 46-year-old math teacher. Her smartphone goes with her.\nAn app on the device gathered her location information, which was then sold without her knowledge. It recorded her whereabouts as often as every two seconds, according to a database of more than a million phones in the New York area that was reviewed by The New York Times. While Ms. Magrin\u2019s identity was not disclosed in those records, The Times was able to easily connect her to that dot.\nThe app tracked her as she went to a Weight Watchers meeting and to her dermatologist\u2019s office for a minor procedure. It followed her hiking with her dog and staying at her ex-boyfriend\u2019s home, information she found disturbing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the thought of people finding out those intimate details that you don\u2019t want people to know,\u201d said Ms. Magrin, who allowed The Times to review her location data.\nLike many consumers, Ms. Magrin knew that apps could track people\u2019s movements. But as smartphones have become ubiquitous and technology more accurate, an industry of snooping on people\u2019s daily habits has spread and grown more intrusive.\nintro By Michael H. Keller and Richard Harris | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobe\nAt least 75 companies receive anonymous, precise location data from apps whose users enable location services to get local news and weather or other information, The Times found. Several of those businesses claim to track up to 200 million mobile devices in the United States \u2014 about half those in use last year. The database reviewed by The Times \u2014 a sample of information gathered in 2017 and held by one company \u2014 reveals people\u2019s travels in startling detail, accurate to within a few yards and in some cases updated more than 14,000 times a day.\n[Learn how to stop apps from tracking your location.]\nThese companies sell, use or analyze the data to cater to advertisers, retail outlets and even hedge funds seeking insights into consumer behavior. It\u2019s a hot market, with sales of location-targeted advertising reaching an estimated $21 billion this year. IBM has gotten into the industry, with its purchase of the Weather Channel\u2019s apps. The social network Foursquare remade itself as a location marketing company. Prominent investors in location start-ups include Goldman Sachs and Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder.\nBusinesses say their interest is in the patterns, not the identities, that the data reveals about consumers. They note that the information apps collect is tied not to someone\u2019s name or phone number but to a unique ID. But those with access to the raw data \u2014 including employees or clients \u2014 could still identify a person without consent. They could follow someone they knew, by pinpointing a phone that regularly spent time at that person\u2019s home address. Or, working in reverse, they could attach a name to an anonymous dot, by seeing where the device spent nights and using public records to figure out who lived there.\nMany location companies say that when phone users enable location services, their data is fair game. But, The Times found, the explanations people see when prompted to give permission are often incomplete or misleading. An app may tell users that granting access to their location will help them get traffic information, but not mention that the data will be shared and sold. That disclosure is often buried in a vague privacy policy.\n\u201cLocation information can reveal some of the most intimate details of a person\u2019s life \u2014 whether you\u2019ve visited a psychiatrist, whether you went to an A.A. meeting, who you might date,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who has proposed bills to limit the collection and sale of such data, which are largely unregulated in the United States.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right to have consumers kept in the dark about how their data is sold and shared and then leave them unable to do anything about it,\u201d he added.\nMobile Surveillance Devices\nAfter Elise Lee, a nurse in Manhattan, saw that her device had been tracked to the main operating room at the hospital where she works, she expressed concern about her privacy and that of her patients.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Ms. Lee, who allowed The Times to examine her location history in the data set it reviewed. \u201cIt feels like someone is following me, personally.\u201d\nThe mobile location industry began as a way to customize apps and target ads for nearby businesses, but it has morphed into a data collection and analysis machine.\nRetailers look to tracking companies to tell them about their own customers and their competitors\u2019. For a web seminar last year, Elina Greenstein, an executive at the location company GroundTruth, mapped out the path of a hypothetical consumer from home to work to show potential clients how tracking could reveal a person\u2019s preferences. For example, someone may search online for healthy recipes, but GroundTruth can see that the person often eats at fast-food restaurants.\n\u201cWe look to understand who a person is, based on where they\u2019ve been and where they\u2019re going, in order to influence what they\u2019re going to do next,\u201d Ms. Greenstein said.\nFinancial firms can use the information to make investment decisions before a company reports earnings \u2014 seeing, for example, if more people are working on a factory floor, or going to a retailer\u2019s stores.\nplanned parenthood By Michael H. Keller | Imagery by Google Earth\nHealth care facilities are among the more enticing but troubling areas for tracking, as Ms. Lee\u2019s reaction demonstrated. Tell All Digital, a Long Island advertising firm that is a client of a location company, says it runs ad campaigns for personal injury lawyers targeting people anonymously in emergency rooms.\n\u201cThe book \u20181984,\u2019 we\u2019re kind of living it in a lot of ways,\u201d said Bill Kakis, a managing partner at Tell All.\nJails, schools, a military base and a nuclear power plant \u2014 even crime scenes \u2014 appeared in the data set The Times reviewed. One person, perhaps a detective, arrived at the site of a late-night homicide in Manhattan, then spent time at a nearby hospital, returning repeatedly to the local police station.\nTwo location firms, Fysical and SafeGraph, mapped people attending the 2017 presidential inauguration. On Fysical\u2019s map, a bright red box near the Capitol steps indicated the general location of President Trump and those around him, cellphones pinging away. Fysical\u2019s chief executive said in an email that the data it used was anonymous. SafeGraph did not respond to requests for comment.\nschool By Michael H. Keller | Imagery by Google Earth\nMore than 1,000 popular apps contain location-sharing code from such companies, according to 2018 data from MightySignal, a mobile analysis firm. Google\u2019s Android system was found to have about 1,200 apps with such code, compared with about 200 on Apple\u2019s iOS.\nThe most prolific company was Reveal Mobile, based in North Carolina, which had location-gathering code in more than 500 apps, including many that provide local news. A Reveal spokesman said that the popularity of its code showed that it helped app developers make ad money and consumers get free services.\nTo evaluate location-sharing practices, The Times tested 20 apps, most of which had been flagged by researchers and industry insiders as potentially sharing the data. Together, 17 of the apps sent exact latitude and longitude to about 70 businesses. Precise location data from one app, WeatherBug on iOS, was received by 40 companies. When contacted by The Times, some of the companies that received that data described it as \u201cunsolicited\u201d or \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\nWeatherBug, owned by GroundTruth, asks users\u2019 permission to collect their location and tells them the information will be used to personalize ads. GroundTruth said that it typically sent the data to ad companies it worked with, but that if they didn\u2019t want the information they could ask to stop receiving it.\nmayor By Michael H. Keller | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobe\nThe Times also identified more than 25 other companies that have said in marketing materials or interviews that they sell location data or services, including targeted advertising.\n[Read more about how The Times analyzed location tracking companies.]\nThe spread of this information raises questions about how securely it is handled and whether it is vulnerable to hacking, said Serge Egelman, a computer security and privacy researcher affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley.\n\u201cThere are really no consequences\u201d for companies that don\u2019t protect the data, he said, \u201cother than bad press that gets forgotten about.\u201d\nA Question of Awareness\nCompanies that use location data say that people agree to share their information in exchange for customized services, rewards and discounts. Ms. Magrin, the teacher, noted that she liked that tracking technology let her record her jogging routes.\nBrian Wong, chief executive of Kiip, a mobile ad firm that has also sold anonymous data from some of the apps it works with, says users give apps permission to use and share their data. \u201cYou are receiving these services for free because advertisers are helping monetize and pay for it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou would have to be pretty oblivious if you are not aware that this is going on.\u201d\nBut Ms. Lee, the nurse, had a different view. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what they have to tell themselves,\u201d she said of the companies. \u201cBut come on.\u201d\nMs. Lee had given apps on her iPhone access to her location only for certain purposes \u2014 helping her find parking spaces, sending her weather alerts \u2014 and only if they did not indicate that the information would be used for anything else, she said. Ms. Magrin had allowed about a dozen apps on her Android phone access to her whereabouts for services like traffic notifications.\nAn app on Lisa Magrin\u2019s cellphone collected her location information, which was then shared with other companies. The data revealed her daily habits, including hikes with her dog, Lulu. Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times\nBut it is easy to share information without realizing it. Of the 17 apps that The Times saw sending precise location data, just three on iOS and one on Android told users in a prompt during the permission process that the information could be used for advertising. Only one app, GasBuddy, which identifies nearby gas stations, indicated that data could also be shared to \u201canalyze industry trends.\u201d\nMore typical was theScore, a sports app: When prompting users to grant access to their location, it said the data would help \u201crecommend local teams and players that are relevant to you.\u201d The app passed precise coordinates to 16 advertising and location companies.\nA spokesman for theScore said that the language in the prompt was intended only as a \u201cquick introduction to certain key product features\u201d and that the full uses of the data were described in the app\u2019s privacy policy.\nThe Weather Channel app, owned by an IBM subsidiary, told users that sharing their locations would let them get personalized local weather reports. IBM said the subsidiary, the Weather Company, discussed other uses in its privacy policy and in a separate \u201cprivacy settings\u201d section of the app. Information on advertising was included there, but a part of the app called \u201clocation settings\u201d made no mention of it.\nA notice that Android users saw when theScore, a sports app, asked for access to their location data. The Weather Channel app showed iPhone users this message when it first asked for their location data.\nThe app did not explicitly disclose that the company had also analyzed the data for hedge funds \u2014 a pilot program that was promoted on the company\u2019s website. An IBM spokesman said the pilot had ended. (IBM updated the app\u2019s privacy policy on Dec. 5, after queries from The Times, to say that it might share aggregated location data for commercial purposes such as analyzing foot traffic.)\nEven industry insiders acknowledge that many people either don\u2019t read those policies or may not fully understand their opaque language. Policies for apps that funnel location information to help investment firms, for instance, have said the data is used for market analysis, or simply shared for business purposes.\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Emmett Kilduff, the chief executive of Eagle Alpha, which sells data to financial firms and hedge funds. Mr. Kilduff said responsibility for complying with data-gathering regulations fell to the companies that collected it from people.\nMany location companies say they voluntarily take steps to protect users\u2019 privacy, but policies vary widely.\nFor example, Sense360, which focuses on the restaurant industry, says it scrambles data within a 1,000-foot square around the device\u2019s approximate home location. Another company, Factual, says that it collects data from consumers at home, but that its database doesn\u2019t contain their addresses.\ndiptych By Michael H. Keller | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobe\nSome companies say they delete the location data after using it to serve ads, some use it for ads and pass it along to data aggregation companies, and others keep the information for years.\nSeveral people in the location business said that it would be relatively simple to figure out individual identities in this kind of data, but that they didn\u2019t do it. Others suggested it would require so much effort that hackers wouldn\u2019t bother.\nIt \u201cwould take an enormous amount of resources,\u201d said Bill Daddi, a spokesman for Cuebiq, which analyzes anonymous location data to help retailers and others, and raised more than $27 million this year from investors including Goldman Sachs and Nasdaq Ventures. Nevertheless, Cuebiq encrypts its information, logs employee queries and sells aggregated analysis, he said.\nThere is no federal law limiting the collection or use of such data. Still, apps that ask for access to users\u2019 locations, prompting them for permission while leaving out important details about how the data will be used, may run afoul of federal rules on deceptive business practices, said Maneesha Mithal, a privacy official at the Federal Trade Commission.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t cure a misleading just-in-time disclosure with information in a privacy policy,\u201d Ms. Mithal said.\nFollowing the Money\nApps form the backbone of this new location data economy.\nThe app developers can make money by directly selling their data, or by sharing it for location-based ads, which command a premium. Location data companies pay half a cent to two cents per user per month, according to offer letters to app makers reviewed by The Times.\nTargeted advertising is by far the most common use of the information.\nGoogle and Facebook, which dominate the mobile ad market, also lead in location-based advertising. Both companies collect the data from their own apps. They say they don\u2019t sell it but keep it for themselves to personalize their services, sell targeted ads across the internet and track whether the ads lead to sales at brick-and-mortar stores. Google, which also receives precise location information from apps that use its ad services, said it modified that data to make it less exact.\nSmaller companies compete for the rest of the market, including by selling data and analysis to financial institutions. This segment of the industry is small but growing, expected to reach about $250 million a year by 2020, according to the market research firm Opimas.\nApple and Google have a financial interest in keeping developers happy, but both have taken steps to limit location data collection. In the most recent version of Android, apps that are not in use can collect locations \u201ca few times an hour,\u201d instead of continuously.\nApple has been stricter, for example requiring apps to justify collecting location details in pop-up messages. But Apple\u2019s instructions for writing these pop-ups do not mention advertising or data sale, only features like getting \u201cestimated travel times.\u201d\nA spokesman said the company mandates that developers use the data only to provide a service directly relevant to the app, or to serve advertising that met Apple\u2019s guidelines.\nApple recently shelved plans that industry insiders say would have significantly curtailed location collection. Last year, the company said an upcoming version of iOS would show a blue bar onscreen whenever an app not in use was gaining access to location data.\nThe discussion served as a \u201cwarning shot\u201d to people in the location industry, David Shim, chief executive of the location company Placed, said at an industry event last year.\nAfter examining maps showing the locations extracted by their apps, Ms. Lee, the nurse, and Ms. Magrin, the teacher, immediately limited what data those apps could get. Ms. Lee said she told the other operating-room nurses to do the same.\n\u201cI went through all their phones and just told them: \u2018You have to turn this off. You have to delete this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cNobody knew.\u201d",

        "title": "Ming-Chi Kuo cuts first quarter iPhone sales estimates by 20%, says iPhone XR demand is low",
        "body": "Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has significantly reduced his forecast for iPhone unit shipments in the upcoming quarters. In a new report today, Kuo says that lower demand for iPhone XR means he sees iPhone sales falling year-over-year significantly.\nFor calendar Q1 2019, Kuo predicts sales in the 38-42 million range (down from 50 million in the year-ago quarter for 2018). Kuo also sees significantly lower iPhone sales for 2019 compared to current consensus estimates \u2026\nNote that Kuo is reporting based on the calendar quarterly period, January \u2013 March. Apple\u2019s financial reports are based on the company\u2019s fiscal quarter, which is three months adjusted from the calendar. Apple\u2019s Q1 2019 earnings represent the holiday period October \u2013 December.\nKuo\u2019s 20% lower forecast would therefore be predicting Apple\u2019s fiscal Q2 2019 earnings.\nKuo expects total iPhone shipments for 2018 in the 210 million range. Most notably, he forecasts 188 to 194 million iPhone sales for the whole of 2019, representing a 5-10% decline. This is a significant fall and way below analyst consensus, which is well clear of the 200 million mark.\nKuo says that the higher proportion of older iPhone models (like the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8) cannot offset sales weakness in iPhone XS and iPhone XR when the holiday season subsides.\nWe have seen Apple do many rounds of aggressive marketing for iPhone XR and iPhone XS in the last few weeks, which seem to support the view that iPhone sales are not as strong this cycle.\nKuo initially expected 20-25 million shipments of iPhone XR for the Q1 2019 period, and has now revised that downward to 15-20 million.\nDue to higher average selling price of end products, Apple\u2019s iPhone income will not be affected as much by shipment declines as iPhone component suppliers. Kuo estimates that he will not have visibility into the 2019 iPhone lineup for a few more months.\nApple will not report unit sales going forward, so investors will be looking closely at iPhone bottom-line revenue to deduce the health of Apple\u2019s smartphone business. Apple as a company has shifted towards Services expansion to provide ongoing revenue and profit growth.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Apple exited the home Wi-Fi market at the wrong time",
        "body": "One of the more interesting news items of 2018 was Apple discontinuing the AirPort lineup. From the first Airport product to the last final AirPort Extreme, Apple was selling premium Wi-Fi hardware devices at a time when most people I knew were content with a $30 router from Walmart. Since they released their final AirPort product, the market has finally shifted up.\nAs end-users are starting to load their home networks with more than a single laptop and a few smartphones, people have realized that having a high-quality router (with whole house coverage) is not a luxury. If you want to load your house up with smart home products, multiple iOS devices, Apple TVs, etc., you have to invest in the infrastructure. Plain and simple, Apple exited the home networking business at the exact wrong time.\nWhen Apple was selling home routers for $199, they were ahead of their time. They had built a router that was high-end, easy to manage, and worked well. Around the rest of the industry, companies were selling home routers that were hard to manage (if step #1 is to log in to an IP address, you missed it), required rebooting, and couldn\u2019t handle the load.\nSince Apple took its eye off of the home router business (The AirPort lineup was dead for many years before the announcement), users have started to buy more expensive solutions. Solutions like Eero , Google WiFi, and AmpliFi have shown that people will invest in their home Wi-Fi. Even solutions from ISPs like Comcast have gotten into the business of upgrading your home Wi-Fi. I\u2019ll be surprised if 2019 comes along and we don\u2019t see an AmazonBasics branded home Wi-Fi system.\nAs companies like Google and Amazon are continuing to push their products in the home, it just makes sense for them to want you to use their home networking gear.\nIf Apple reconsidered the home Wi-Fi market, here are some ways it could work.\nHomeKit Gateway\nIn hindsight, 2019 is when Apple should have made a push into the home networking market. The time is right for Apple to sell a mesh router system that works well with HomeKit and the rest of the lineup of Apple\u2019s products. While HomePod and Apple TV act as HomeKit gateways (for offsite access to smart home devices), it makes way more sense for this to come from an Apple brand mesh router system.\niCloud VPN\nWhile it can be challenging to implement exceptional VPN access on public Wi-Fi (due to splash pages), I think this feature would be a fundamental pitch for Apple over other solutions. I can imagine an Apple SVP on stage at WWDC discussing all that can be determined from using your smartphone in public Wi-Fi and the privacy implications of it.\nApple could then say our VPN system to your home internet will provide an additional layer of security. Your iCloud login could be set to automatically VPN to your home network when at a coffee shop so you have an extra layer of protection. You could also set up \u201csafe\u201d networks that you trust (work, parent\u2019s house, etc.) where it wouldn\u2019t try to use the iCloud VPN. It would be similar to the way that Encrypt.me\u2019s Auto Secure feature works. My rule is that if I don\u2019t manage the network, I don\u2019t trust it.\nSiri and HomePod\nAs Apple continues to find ways to market the HomePod, integration with a Wi-Fi network makes a lot of sense. I could see an option for a parent to say \u201cHey Siri, pause the Wi-Fi on my kids\u2019 devices\u201d or \u201cHey Siri, pause ScreenTime for today.\u201d\nThere are a lot of options for Apple building out how Siri could interact with a home Wi-Fi network. Another option would be to allow HomePods to act as mesh repeaters for a rebuilt Apple home Wi-Fi system.\nAll Apple All The Time\nApple as a brand has quite the following. There is a large subset of its users that want to use Apple for everything. Whether it\u2019s just the brand name, the commitment to personal privacy, or the reliability, Apple has a serious following. As we continue to add clients to our Wi-Fi networks, the company behind the router will continue to become very important.\nAs of this writing, I have 29 devices on my network (Apple TVs, iPads, iPhones, MacBook Pro, and various smart home devices). If Apple wants to continue to make a dent with HomeKit at a platform (and Apple products in general), it needs to build a competitor to Google Wifi, Eero, and the rest. There is no reason Apple can\u2019t sell a great router with mesh beacons at a price similar to Eero. They don\u2019t have to be the cheapest, but they need to be the best. When Wi-Fi is slow or unreliable, everyone suffers. While there are good solutions on the market, I believe Apple could make a great Wi-Fi solution.\nWould you buy a modern home Wi-Fi system from Apple?\nPhoto by Andres Urena on Unsplash\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "body": "Missed the GamesBeat Summit excitement? Don't worry! Tune in now to catch all of the live and virtual sessions here.\nNetflix is further distancing itself from Apple\u2019s iTunes tax bracket. Earlier this year, the streaming giant enabled iOS users in more than two dozen markets to bypass the iTunes payment method as part of an experiment. The company now tells VentureBeat that it has concluded the experiment and has incorporated the change globally.\n\u201cWe no longer support iTunes as a method of payment for new members,\u201d a Netflix spokesperson told VentureBeat. Existing members, however, can continue to use iTunes as a method of payment, the spokesperson added.\nThe company did not share exactly when it rolled out the change globally, but a support representative VentureBeat spoke with pegged the timeframe as late last month. Additionally, the support rep added that customers who are rejoining Netflix using an iOS device, after having canceled payment for at least one month, also won\u2019t be able to use iTunes billing.\nThe move, which will allow Netflix to keep all proceeds from its new paying iPhone and iPad customers, underscores the tension between developers and the marquee distributors of mobile apps \u2014 Apple and Google.\nGrowing tension\nApp developer have urged both companies to lower the tolls they levy on each transaction that goes through their respective app stores. Apple and Google charge 15 percent on each in-app subscription on their platforms. The two used to take a 30 percent cut, but in the past two years have slashed their ask.\nNew Netflix users with an iPhone or iPad will be required to sign up and pay by visiting the streaming service\u2019s website. In the Android universe, Netflix stopped letting users pay through the Google Play store in May.\nNetflix, which remains one of the top-grossing apps on Apple\u2019s App Store, is not alone in trying to avoid Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s fees. Music streaming service Spotify, news outlet Financial Times, Fortnite developer Epic Games, and Steam developer Valve have also brushed shoulders with the giants.\nEpic Games, which first ditched Google Play altogether, launched its own game store for PC and Mac platforms with a 12 percent cut of revenue early this month. Days later, communication platform Discord announced that it was planning to charge only 10 percent on each sale to game developers on its recently launched store.",

In a statement, the companies called the anti-encryption law in Australia \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and said it will undermine the privacy of users:\n\u201cThe new Australian law is deeply flawed, overly broad, and lacking in adequate independent oversight over the new authorities,\u201d said the Reform Government Surveillance coalition in a statement. The tech companies added that the law would \u201cundermine the cybersecurity, human rights, or the right to privacy of our users.\u201d\nThe coalition also called on Australian lawmakers to \u201cpromptly address these flaws when it reconvenes\u201d in 2019. In addition to Microsoft, Apple, and Google, the coalition includes Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Oath, LinkedIn, Evernote, Snap, and Twitter.\nApple first spoke out against the law in October, saying that tools designed to weaken encryption are a \u201chuge risk to our digital security.\u201d Further, Apple said that it is \u201cwrong to weaken security for millions of law-abiding customers in order to investigate the very few who post a threat.\u201d\nAs explained last week, the law outlines that select government agencies can ask tech companies for three different levels of assistance in accessing encrypted messages: \u201ctechnical assistance request,\u201d \u201ctechnical assistance notice,\u201d and \u201ctechnical capability notice.\u201d Companies who refuse to cooperate with such requests could face financial penalties.\nRelated stories:\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Apple published a surprising amount of detail about how the HomePod works",
        "body": "Today, Apple published a long and informative blog post by its audio software engineering and speech teams about how they use machine learning to make Siri responsive on the HomePod, and it reveals a lot about why Apple has made machine learning such a focus of late.\nThe post discusses working in a far-field setting where users are calling on Siri from any number of locations around the room relative to the HomePod's location. The premise is essentially that making Siri work on the HomePod is harder than on the iPhone for that reason. The device must compete with loud music playback from itself.\nApple addresses these issues with multiple microphones along with machine learning methods\u2014specifically:\nMask-based multichannel filtering using deep learning to remove echo and background noise\nUnsupervised learning to separate simultaneous sound sources and trigger-phrase based stream selection to eliminate interfering speech\nApple's teams write that \"speech enhancement performance has improved substantially due to deep learning.\"\nThis new post is basically an article meant to establish Apple as a leader in the space, which the company is in some ways but not others. The post covers a wide range of topics, like echo cancellation and suppression, mask-based noise reduction, and deep-learning based streamer selection, among other things. There is a considerable amount of technical and mathematical detail, as it's written like an academic paper with detailed citations. We won't recap it all here\u2014it's a lot\u2014but give it a read if you're interested in a fairly deep dive on the techniques being used at Apple (and other tech companies, although specific approaches do vary).\nAdvertisement\nAs noted previously, Apple has made machine learning a major focus of its work over the past couple of years. The Neural Engine on the iPhone's A12 and the iPad Pro's A12X chip is many times more powerful than what was included in previous Apple devices, and it's much more powerful than machine learning silicon in competing SoCs.\nWe hear about \"machine learning\" so much in tech product marketing pitches that it starts to sound like a catch-all that doesn't mean a lot to the user, so pieces like this can be helpful for context even if they're fundamentally promotional. Google has generally done a good job using its blogs to give users and partners a deeper understanding; here, Apple is doing the same.\nFor now, Amazon and Google are the market leaders when it comes to digital assistant technology. Apple has some catching up to do with Siri, but the approaches behind these competitors are not the same, so comparisons aren't as easy as they could be. Most relevant for users, Apple focuses on doing machine learning tasks on the local machine (either the user's, or the application or feature developer's) not in the cloud. But Apple's Core ML API does allow developers to tap into outside cloud networks, and Android devices also do local processing, like with photos, but the emphasis is different.\nThe HomePod smart speaker launched early this year. In our review, we found its sound quality to be outstanding and Siri to be responsive, but the lack of on-device Spotify support, the price, and other limitations of Siri as compared to Amazon's Alexa (found in the Sonos One and many other smart speakers) prevented us from making an unequivocal recommendation. Apple has not specifically shared individual unit sales of the HomePod in its quarterly earnings reports.",

        "body": "Unlike the previous 2014 model, the 2018 Mac mini has user-upgradeable RAM. The repair experts at iFixit are now selling a do-it-yourself RAM upgrade kit for the 2018 Mac mini that can save you hundreds of dollars.\nThe upgrade kit includes 16GB or 32GB of 2,666MHz DDR4 RAM, the same type of memory Apple uses in the 2018 Mac mini, along with all of the tools and bits needed to complete the upgrade: an iFixit opening tool, a spudger, angled tweezers, a precision bit driver, and three types of 4mm Torx precision bits.\n2018 Mac mini models are equipped with 8GB of RAM by default, but they can be configured with 16GB or 32GB of RAM on Apple's online store for an extra $200 or $600 respectively. By comparison, iFixit charges $164.99 for its 16GB kit and $324.99 for its 32GB kit, reflecting savings of $35 and $275 respectively.\nThree things to keep in mind:\nThis is iFixit-branded RAM that matches Apple's specifications.\nIf you ever need in-warranty service on your 2018 Mac mini, and Apple detects that you opened up the computer, the Genius Bar may deny service. However, iFixit says this is illegal in the United States under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.\nThere is a risk of damaging the Mac mini if the upgrade is not completed carefully.\nThose interested in proceeding can follow iFixit's 2018 Mac mini RAM replacement guide.\niFixit also sells the 16GB RAM modules individually for $159.99 each.",

        "title": "Apple to Launch iPad mini 5 and Entry Level 10-inch iPad Next Year",
        "body": "Apple is preparing to launch a new fifth-generation iPad mini in the first half of 2019, according to sources in the Apple supply chain cited by the China Times, followed by a new entry-level iPad in two versions.\nThe report, first spotted by Japanese blog Mac Otakara, claims that Apple is preparing to launch a low-priced so-called iPad mini 5 in the first half of next year in an attempt to halt a general decline in iPad sales, with mass production expected to start by the end of December.\nApple hasn't updated its smallest iPad since September 2015, but the device did receive a price cut in March 2017, with a 128GB capacity model costing $399.\nReliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed in October that Apple is working on a new version of the iPad mini with an upgraded processor and a lower-cost display panel, with the device being launched in 2018 or early next year.\nNotably, Kuo's prediction came two months after DigiTimes said it did not believe Apple plans to introduce an updated iPad mini, and in fact has \"no further plan\" for the smaller tablet.\nAs for Apple's entry-level iPad, today's report claims that next year Apple will replace its sixth-generation 9.7-inch iPad with a similarly priced model that features a 10-inch display within a narrower frame.\nFollowing strong sales of the 2017 model, Apple is said to be launching two low-priced versions of the iPad in 2019 to boost sales growth. A more exact timeframe for launch was not given beyond the \"second half\" of 2019. Apple's 9.7-inch iPad was last updated in March 2018 and in the same month the year before that.\nApple's 9.7-inch iPad is thicker, heavier, and has fewer features than iPad Pro models, but it does support Apple Pencil and is also Apple's most affordable tablet, starting at $329.\nToday's report goes on to say Apple plans to reduce production costs of the two iPads by reducing the amount to LED procurement in Japan and switching to Korean-made LED displays.",

        "title": "Apple Music removes ability for artists to post to Connect, posts removed from Artist Pages and For You",
        "body": "Apple Music Connect appears to slowly be going the way of iTunes Ping. Apple has started notifying Apple Music artists that it is removing the ability for artists to post content to Apple Music Connect, and previously posted Apple Music Connect content is being removed from the For You section and Artist Pages in Apple Music. Connect content will still be viewable through search results on Apple Music, but Apple is removing artist-submitted Connect posts from search in May\u2026\nHere\u2019s the announcement that artists are receiving today:\nWe\u2019ve made a few changes to Apple Music that we\u2019d like to tell you about. We\u2019re always looking for ways to enhance our focus on artists and help them better connect to fans. So we\u2019ve given Artist Pages an all-new design and added new, personalized Artist Radio. Today we\u2019re streamlining music discovery by removing Connect posts from Artist Pages and For You. This means you\u2019ll no longer be able to post to Connect as of December 13, 2018, but all previously uploaded content will still be searchable until May 24, 2019. You can still create Artist Playlists with the latest version of Apple Music.\nApple also says \u201cConnect posts from artists are no longer supported\u201d on this support document.\nApple Music Connect debuted with the launch of Apple Music as a way for artists to reach fans directly through the music app. While there was a flood of content at launch, the feature hasn\u2019t been developed much since then and it has shown \u2014 many artists only have content from when the feature debuted.\nAs a result, Apple has demoted Connect from a dedicated tab in the Music app to a section buried below music recommendations and personalized playlists in the For You section.\nApple also uses the section to post content from its own music collections of curated categories (which may still happen?) but it certainly sounds like Connect as a platform will all but be abandoned by May 2019.\nApple Music has done well with other social features that iTunes Ping sort of tried to tackle years earlier.\nFor example, Apple Music users can follow each other and share play activity as a way to recommend music on the platform. Apple also has an automated playlist that recommends music weekly based on what friends are listening to.\nApple Music still has opportunities to integrate features that benefit artists and fans alike. For instance, Apple could integrate concert ticket sales in Apple Music and make it even easier to know when artists in your library release new music (subscribers receive sporadic notifications for now).\nApple Music is typically updated annually alongside platform updates for iOS, so perhaps we\u2019ll see more features come to Apple Music when iOS 13 is previewed in June at WWDC. For now, it certainly looks like Apple Music is pulling back heavily on Connect.\nRelated Stories:\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",
