        "title": "iOS 15.4 enables Face ID support while wearing a mask, no Apple Watch required",
        "body": "With iOS 15.4 beta 1 Apple is starting to test the ability to use Face ID while wearing a mask but without the need for an Apple Watch around. Not only that, but the company is also improving glasses support.\nMask support was first spotted by YouTuber Brandon Butch. On the screenshot, you can read Apple\u2019s explanation about this feature:\n\u201cFace ID is most accurate when it\u2019s set up for full-face recognition only. To use Face ID while wearing a mask, iPhone can recognize the unique features around the eye to authenticate.\u201d\nWith that, you can set up the facial recognition feature with or without a mask. You won\u2019t need to wear a mask during setup though, even if you choose facial recognition with a mask.\nTo set this new feature, just head to your iPhone settings, \u201cFace ID & Passcode,\u201d and choose \u201cUse Face ID with a mask.\u201d\nAlthough Apple is at least two years behind, this feature is very handy as a lot of iPhone users don\u2019t have an Apple Watch. Even though unlocking your phone with the Watch can be useful, anyone around you can also unlock your iPhone.\nWith this new iOS 15.4 feature, it will be possible to unlock your iPhone with the facial recognition feature focusing on your eye area to authenticate.\nFace ID works better with glasses on iOS 15.4\nAlongside the ability to unlock your face with a mask, Apple is improving Face ID recognition while wearing glasses. The company explains:\n\u201cUsing Face ID while wearing a mask works best when it\u2019s set up to recognize each pair of glasses you wear regularly. Face ID with a mask doesn\u2019t support sunglasses.\u201d\nIf you remember when Apple announced the iPhone X, it disclaimed that some sunglasses wouldn\u2019t work with Face ID depending on the lenses. Since setting up facial recognition with a mask requires the TrueDepth system to analyze only your eye area, it wouldn\u2019t make sense if this part is covered with sunglasses. It appears regular glasses are still fine, even with a mask.\nAs the company is still working on iOS 15.4, it will take some time until you can take advantage of these features. In the meantime, you can read our tutorial on how to improve the iPhone\u2019s facial recognition with a mask here.\nWhat do you think of these changes? Are you excited to try them out? Let us know in the comment section below.\nWell this is new \ud83e\udd14 (iOS 15.4 Beta 1) pic.twitter.com/MSe7hmPGlR \u2014 Brandon Butch (@BrandonButch) January 27, 2022",

Read our ethics policy\nJeff Wilcox (source: LinkedIn)\nApple Silicon leader and T2 security processor developer Jeff Wilcox has left Apple to rejoin Intel and oversee architecture for all Intel System-on-a-Chip (SoC) designs.\nAs Apple heads to the end of its self-imposed two-year transition from Intel to its own Apple Silicon, the company has lost the leader of its M1 development team. Jeff Wilcox originally joined Apple from Intel in 2013, and is now returning to that company as it works on introducing new processors.\n\"After an amazing eight years I have decided to leave Apple and pursue another opportunity,\" wrote Wilcox on his LinkedIn page. \"It has been an incredible ride and I could not be prouder of all we accomplished during my time there, culminating in the Apple Silicon transition with the M1, M1 Pro and M1 Max SOCs and systems. I will dearly miss all of my Apple colleagues and friends.\"\n\"I'm pleased to share that I have started a new position as Intel Fellow, Design Engineering Group CTO, Client SoC Architecture at Intel Corporation,\" he continued. \"I could not be more thrilled to be back working with the amazing teams there to help create groundbreaking SOCs.

        "title": "Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 15 years ago",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nOn January 9, 2007, in the shadow of the CES, Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone. You know that it was an extraordinary and flawless demo from the outside, but what you don't remember is everything else that was launched \u2014 nor how part of the keynote went wrong.\nSteve Jobs with the original iPhone\nContext is everything. On Sunday, January 7, 2007, Bill Gates gave the keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Hammering home Microsoft's then buzz phrase 'Digital Decade,' he talked about how great hardware wasn't enough, that we needed connected experiences. \"Where people are being productive, doing new creative things, where they're mobile... that is the key element that is missing.\"\nHe said that, \"Vista and the PC continue to have the central role,\" though he also claimed that Windows Vista was \"the highest quality release that we've ever done.\"\nTwo days later and around 400 miles away, Steve Jobs introduced the very device, the very experience that Gates said was missing. He introduced the iPhone at Macworld San Francisco. While Jobs didn't use the term 'post-PC era' then, that's what the iPhone created. This was truly the device for productive, creative people on the move, and as an extra bonus, it ran OS X \u2014 now called macOS \u2014 rather than Windows Vista.\nMany more things\nThat 2007 keynote is justifiably famous for how well it introduced the iPhone. Jobs opened it by saying that, \"We're going to make some history together today\" and it is the phone he meant.\nHis presentation is an example of a really finely produced keynote, and it takes you through the world of cell phones as they were before showing you exactly where they were all going wrong. And then how the iPhone would of course fix all that.\nToday the segment showing what phones used to look like is a historical curiosity. But at the time, that wasn't the past, it was the present and these archaic-seeming phones were the best available.\nIf you dislike Apple, if your personal preference means you buy Androids instead of iPhones, you're still benefiting from that keynote today. During the many times Apple would later go to court over the similarities between iPhone and Android, it would present a graphic demonstrating its position. This is the one it showed when up against Samsung.\nChart showing the impact of iPhone on Samsung design\nMany more things\nYet the presentation did feature other things, some of which were roundly applauded at the time and one other that we've only truly learned to appreciate in the years since.\nJobs opened the presentation by referring back to what he'd announced the previous year. That 2006 keynote had been when Apple not only announced it was moving from PowerPC to Intel processors, it vowed to complete the transition for all Mac models within 12 months. In 2007, he referred to this as being a \"huge heart transplant\" and that, \"we did it in seven months.\"\nHe said that Apple's previous year had been remarkably successful and he also specified that over half of all new Mac buyers were now switching from Windows. It had recently been half of all buyers in Apple Stores, but now it was 50 percent wherever you could buy a Mac.\nJobs shows quote from Microsoft Senior Leadership Team's Jim Allchin about buying Macs\nNext, he showed a quote from a 2004 internal memo at Microsoft where Jim Allchin of the company's Senior Leadership team said, \"I would buy a Mac today if I was not working at Microsoft.\"\nJobs revealed that Allchin was shortly to retire, so he's \"alerted our Seattle stores to keep an eye out for him and give him really good service.\"\nThe rest of that Allchin memo, incidentally, included the statement that \"Longhorn [codename for Vista] is a pig and I don't see any solution to this problem.\" Jobs didn't quote that, but he did run a new ad from the Get a Mac campaign specifically aimed at Vista.\n\"So 2007 is going to be a great year for the Mac,\" said Steve Jobs, \"but this is all we're going to talk about the Mac today. We're going to move on to some other things.\"\nRemember that back in the mid-2000s, there were more rumors about Apple introducing a phone than there are today about it making a car. Vastly more. So with these words, he was surely going to make the big announcement next.\nExcept he didn't. Instead, Jobs seemed to tease us by talking about Apple's music business. What appeared to be a diversion was just the first part of setting the stage for the day's real purpose.\nBut for now, Jobs revealed that they had just passed 2 billion song sales and that the iPod had become the world's most popular video player \"by a large margin.\" He revealed that in the then first four months that movies had been available on iTunes, people had bought 1.3 million of them.\nAt the time, there were only 100 films on the service, but Jobs announced this would increase to 250 because Paramount was coming to iTunes.\nSteve Jobs mocks the launch-month market share of the Microsoft Zune\nJobs managed to make 250 movies sound good \u2014 but there was one figure he didn't even try to put a gloss on. And that was sales of the Zune, Microsoft's iPod killer which had been released the previous November. Only figures for that launch month were available, but they showed that after a big launch, the Zune had managed only 2 percent market share.\n\"No matter how you try to spin this, ah, what can you say?\" said Jobs.\nAt last the iPhone\nFinally, at 24 minutes into the presentation, Jobs paused. \"This is a day I've been looking forward to for two-and-a-half years,\" he said. Later, at the end of the keynote and when it had gone so well, he also confessed on stage: \"You know, I didn't sleep a wink last night, I was so excited about today.\"\nIt turned out that there were other reasons to not sleep a wink and Apple engineers knew them all. While it was only revealed very much later, Jobs's presentation was attended by iPhone engineers who knew how easily it could all have gone wrong. The software wasn't finished, the whole phone was still being worked on, and if Jobs deviated from the planned demo, it was likely that the phone would crash.\nSteve Jobs with the then most popular smart phones in 2007\nInstead, as you know, the whole presentation went flawlessly. Or rather, most of it did.\nMy clicker isn't working\nHaving successfully concluded the demo of the new iPhone, Jobs went on to talk about market share and clicked to move on to his next slide. And clicked. And clicked.\nHe explained that the clicker wasn't working and picked up a spare \u2014 which appeared to also not work. \"They're scrambling backstage right now,\" he told the audience.\nThis segment is completely forgotten now, yet at a key moment on this most crucial presentation of his Apple career, it went wrong. You can only imagine how nervous it must've made Jobs.\nBut then you can also admire how he managed to fill for 55 seconds with a story about how Steve Wozniak had built a clicker-like device at college to mess with people's TV reception.\nAiming for 1 percent\nEarlier, Jobs had made you think that the Zune's 2 percent market share was disastrous. When he got the slides working, he built up to saying that Apple was aiming for a 1 percent share of the cellphone market \u2014 and that this was great.\nThere was a bit of a difference though. Using the latest 2006 figures available, Jobs said that the cell market had been around one billion phones. Apple was aiming for 10 million iPhones in the first year.\nApple's aims for iPhone sales now seem modest\nThe iPhone didn't actually launch until June, but it then took only 74 days for the company to sell its first million of them.\nDifferent company\nIt's just that the company was no longer Apple Computer, Inc. The very last thing Steve Jobs announced at this presentation 15 years ago was that the company was changing its name.\nStanding in front of a side that showed the Mac, iPod, Apple TV, and iPhone, he pointed out that only the first of those is truly what you'd call a computer. \"We've thought about this,\" he said, talking about how Apple was doing more than just computers, \"and we thought maybe our name should reflect this a little bit more than it does.\"\nFrom this day on, the company would now be known as just Apple, Inc \u2014 and it would truly never be the same again.\nMany more things\nThe iPhone was the first iOS device, a category that now includes the iPod touch, plus all the variations of the iPad.\nIn September 2018, Tim Cook announced that Apple was close to shipping its 2 billionth iOS device.\nAt the time, AppleInsider worked the numbers and calculated that the 2 billionth iPhone \u2014 specifically iPhone \u2014 would be sold in the middle of 2021. No one knew then about the impact of the coronavirus on all phone sales \u2014 but it was already true that sales had been declining worldwide.\nApple now doesn't report iPhone sales, and it has not announced crossing the 2 billion figure. However, in January 2021, Apple announced that there were then over 1 billion iPhones in current, active use.\nThat's not sold, not pre-ordered, but over 1 billion iPhones being used every day. And at the same time, Cook said there were 1.65 billion Apple devices in use worldwide.\nThe iPhone was an enormous gamble, and it has surely paid off enormously.",

        "body": "Apple briefly became the world's first $3 trillion company today based on market capitalization, which is the total value of all of the company's outstanding shares. The milestone came after Apple's stock price rose over 40% in the last year.\nThe impressive feat, which Apple achieved when its stock price reached the $182.86 mark during intraday trading, came just over 16 months after Apple became a $2 trillion company and less than three and a half years after Apple reached the $1 trillion mark.\nUpdate: Apple's market cap was slightly below the $3 trillion mark again as of the stock market closing at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\nApple has reported strong earnings results since the start of the pandemic, as its products and services have been in high demand as more people work, learn, and connect with others from home. The company's revenue is forecasted to top $118 billion in the current quarter, surpassing its all-time quarterly record of $111.4 billion set a year ago.\nIn a memo shared with staff when Apple hit the $1 trillion mark in 2018, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the achievement was \"not the most important measure of our success,\" adding that \"financial returns are simply the result of Apple's innovation, putting our products and customers first, and always staying true to our values.\"\n\"Hitting $3 trillion is another historical moment for Apple as the company continues to prove the doubters wrong with the renaissance of growth story playing out in Cupertino,\" said analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush, which has a $200 price target for AAPL.\nApple will look to build upon its success in 2022, with a wide range of products rumored to launch, including at least five new Macs, a redesigned iPad Pro with support for wireless charging, a rugged version of the Apple Watch, second-generation AirPods Pro, an AR/VR headset focused on gaming, content consumption, and communications, and more.",

        "title": "Apple's AirTag uncovers a secret German intelligence agency",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nA researcher has sent one of Apple's AirTags to a mysterious \"federal authority\" in Germany to locate its true offices \u2014 and to help prove that it's really part of an intelligence agency.\nApple's AirTags have already been used for good and for bad in cases involving the tracking of individuals, but now a German researcher has used one in an expose of government secrets.\nActivist Lilith Wittmann claims that she has uncovered how Germany's little-known Federal Telecommunications Service is actually a \"camouflage authority\" for a secret intelligence agency. Initially she wrote how she \"accidentally stumbled upon a federal authority that does not exist.\"\nNow Wittmann has detailed her subsequent and extremely thorough attempts to prove her suspicion. She has methodically gone through every step of learning what she can of the intelligence agency, including where it is.\nSome of the steps she details are no longer possible to reproduce, such as her initial one of simply looking up a list of federal authorities online. Similarly, Wittmann includes transcripts of phone calls with an official whose cell number that she reports then ceased working.\nThrough calls like that, IP searches, and even driving to official buildings, Wittmann worked to track down the mysterious Bundesservice Telekommunikation, or Federal Telecommunications Service.\nShe establishes multiple reasons to believe it is part of the Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI), and ultimately concludes that there are actually two \"camouflage\" authorities. Both are allegedly a secret part of an intelligence agency named the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.\nUsing an AirTag\nWittmann says that everyone she spoke to denied being part of this intelligence agency. But what she describes as a \"good indicator,\" would be if she could prove that the postal address for this \"federal authority\" actually leads to the intelligence service's apparent offices.\n\"To understand where mail ends up,\" she writes (in translation), \"[you can do] a lot of manual research. Or you can simply send a small device that regularly transmits its current position (a so-called AirTag) and see where it lands.\"\nShe sent a parcel with an AirTag and watched through Apple's Find My system as it was delivered via the Berlin sorting center to a sorting office in Cologne-Ehrenfeld. And then appears at the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in Cologne.\nSo an AirTag addressed to a telecommunications authority based in one part of Germany, ends up in the offices of an intelligence agency based in another part of the country.\nWittmann's research is also now detailed in the German Wikipedia entry for the federal telecommunications service. It recounts how following her original discovery in December 2021, subsequent government press conferences have denied that there is such a federal telecommunications service at all.",

The company was responding to a Wall Street Journal report detailing the lock-in and social pressure Apple's walled garden is creating among US teens. iMessage brands texts from iPhone users with a blue background and gives them additional features, while texts from Android phones are shown in green and only have the base SMS feature set. According to the article, \"Teens and college students said they dread the ostracism that comes with a green text. The social pressure is palpable, with some reporting being ostracized or singled out after switching away from iPhones.\" Google feels this is a problem.\n\"iMessage should not benefit from bullying,\" the official Android Twitter account wrote. \"Texting should bring us together, and the solution exists. Let's fix this as one industry.\" Google SVP Hiroshi Lockheimer chimed in, too, saying, \"Apple's iMessage lock-in is a documented strategy. Using peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products is disingenuous for a company that has humanity and equity as a core part of its marketing. The standards exist today to fix this.\"\nThe \"solution\" Google is pushing here is RCS, or Rich Communication Services, a GSMA standard from 2008 that has slowly gained traction as an upgrade to SMS. RCS adds typing indicators, user presence, and better image sharing to carrier messaging. It is a 14-year-old carrier standard, though, so it lacks many of the features you would want from a modern messaging service, like end-to-end encryption and support for non-phone devices. Google tries to band-aid over the aging standard with its \"Google Messaging\" client, but the result is a lot of clunky solutions that don't add up to a good modern messaging service.\nSince RCS replaces SMS, Google has been on a campaign to get the industry to make the upgrade. After years of protesting, the US carriers are all onboard, and there is some uptake among the international carriers, too. The biggest holdout is Apple, which only supports SMS through iMessage.\nAdvertisement\nApple hasn't ever publicly shot down the idea of adding RCS to iMessage, but thanks to documents revealed in the Epic v. Apple case, we know the company views iMessage lock-in as a valuable weapon. Bringing RCS to iMessage and making communication easier with Android users would only help to weaken Apple's walled garden, and the company has said it doesn't want that.\nIn the US, iPhones are more popular with young adults than ever. As The Wall Street Journal notes, \"Among US consumers, 40% use iPhones, but among those aged 18 to 24, more than 70% are iPhone users.\" It credits Apple's lock-in with apps like iMessage for this success.\nReaping what you sow\nGoogle clearly views iMessage's popularity as a problem, and the company is hoping this public-shaming campaign will get Apple to change its mind on RCS. But Google giving other companies advice on a messaging strategy is a laughable idea since Google probably has the least credibility of any tech company when it comes to messaging services. If the company really wants to do something about iMessage, it should try competing with it.\nAs we recently detailed in a 25,000-word article, Google's messaging history is one of constant product startups and shutdowns. Thanks to a lack of product focus or any kind of top-down mandate from Google's CEO, no division is really \"in charge\" of messaging. As a consequence, the company has released 13 half-hearted messaging products since iMessage launched in 2011. If Google wants to look to someone to blame for iMessage's dominance, it should start with itself, since it has continually sabotaged and abandoned its own plans to make an iMessage competitor.\nMessaging is important, and even if it isn't directly monetizable, a dominant messaging app has real, tangible benefits for an ecosystem. The rest of the industry understood this years ago. Facebook paid $22 billion to buy WhatsApp in 2014 and took the app from 450 million users to 2 billion users. Along with Facebook Messenger, Facebook has two dominant messaging platforms today, especially internationally. Salesforce paid $27 billion for Slack in 2020, and Tencent's WeChat, a Chinese messaging app, is pulling in 1.2 billion users and yearly revenues of $5.5 billion. Snapchat is up to a $67 billion market cap, and Telegram is getting $40 billion valuations from investors. Google keeps trying ideas in this market, but it never makes an investment that is anywhere close to the competition.",

        "body": "Apple fans who take a virtual stroll through Palo Alto inside Apple Maps and Google Maps no longer get to see Tim Cook\u2019s house. The modern, four-bedroom condo has had a giant digital wall erected right in front of it.\nWe spotted the change after Apple received temporary restraining order against an alleged stalker, who claimed to be Cook\u2019s wife, threatened the Apple boss and was caught trespassing on his property.\nTim Cook\u2019s house goes incognito inside Google Maps\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to see certain things blurred out inside Apple Maps and Google Maps. Both services regularly conceal things like faces and license plates. However, it is rare to see entire buildings hidden behind big, blurry walls.\nBut that\u2019s all you get when you visit Cook\u2019s house in Palo Alto, California, today. The rather modest home (for the CEO of the world\u2019s biggest company, at least), which is believed to be worth $3.5 million, can no longer be seen in street view.\nAlthough it\u2019s not completely clear why Cook\u2019s house has been hidden, it likely has something to do with a rather disturbing series of events revealed in court documents filed in Santa Clara County. Apple\u2019s application for a temporary restraining order against an alleged stalker contained copies of emails sent to Cook along with other details about the incidents in question. The documents also included the Apple CEO\u2019s home address in Palo Alto.\nGoogle took similar steps to blur out Billie Eilish\u2019s primary residence in Los Angeles last year when she, too, was granted a temporary restraining order against a man who repeatedly showed up at her home.\nCook\u2019s \u2018wife\u2019 told to stay away\nCook\u2019s stalker began tagging the Apple CEO in worrisome tweets that referred to him as her husband and the father of her twins. She also demanded that other CEOs stop following Cook on Twitter.\n\u201cI notify you both unfollow each other,\u201d one of the tweets, which tagged Microsoft chief Satya Nadella, read. \u201cI can smell, see, and feel both of you. Tim Cook is my bed man. My husband, my twins\u2019 daddy. Stop doing that shit!\u201d\n\u201cSandra Pichia [sic], CEO of Google insisting to interrupt Cook\u2019s love and tried to hurt me several times,\u201d read another. \u201cTotally understand my husband\u2019s past and relationships with unexpected parties.\u201d\nThe 45-year-old Virginia woman is now barred from possessing a gun and getting within 200 yards of Cook and other Apple employees. She also cannot visit any Apple property or Cook\u2019s home.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment from Cult of Mac.\nYou can hide your home, too\nIf you would prefer for your home to be censored inside Apple Maps and Google Maps, all you have to do is file a request. Apple has a webpage that explains the process, while Google takes requests inside Google Maps.\nHere\u2019s more info on how to blur out your house in Apple Maps and Google Maps.",

        "body": "Apple employees may have to stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines if they want to avoid significant hassles. The Verge says it has seen internal email revealing that Apple will require corporate and retail staff to offer proof of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots if they want to enter offices or stores from February 15th onward. Once an employee is eligible for a booster, they'll have four weeks to get it and provide evidence.\nWorkers who are either unvaccinated or can't provide proof will have to provide negative rapid antigen test results from January 24th onward, but it's not certain if this affects both office and store employees.\nApple was plain in its reasoning. The \"waning efficacy\" of initial vaccine doses and the rise of COVID-19's Omicron variant meant that boosters were necessary to guard against serious illness, according to the company.\nWe've asked Apple for comment. The report comes just days after Facebook parent Meta required booster shots for a return to the office, and not long after Apple temporarily closed numerous stores following COVID-19 outbreaks. Simply put, there's a lot of added pressure to require boosters and minimize significant disruptions.",

        "title": "Model stalked in NYC after stranger slips AirTag into her coat pocket",
        "body": "A swimsuit model says she was stalked by a stranger who slipped an Apple AirTag tracker into her coat pocket before following her for five hours.\nBrooks Nader, 26, claims the disturbing incident occurred Wednesday night while she was out in New York City, and she only realized it when her iPhone alerted her to the fact that an \u201cunknown accessory\u201d was moving with her.\nSwimsuit model Brooks Nader realized she was being tracked with an Apple AirTag when her iPhone alerted her to the \u201cunknown accessory\u201d that was moving with her. Getty Images for Sports Illustra\nAn AirTag \u2014 first released last April \u2014 is a nickel-size tracking device that acts as a key finder, with Apple users able to attach it to their personal items to make sure they never get lost.\nHowever, there have been multiple reports that the gadgets, which retail from $29.99, have been placed by stalkers and thieves inside other people\u2019s handbags, cars and pockets to track their whereabouts.\nThe Sports Illustrated stunner says she was unaware the AirTag was in her coat pocket for five hours. Yu Tsai/SPORTS ILLUSTRATED\nThe model didn\u2019t realize she was being tracked until she received a push alert on her iPhone about an \u201cunknown accessory detected.\u201d It read: \u201cThis item has been moving with you for a while.\u201d Instagram / @brooksnader\nNader appears to be the latest victim, with the model relaying her experience to her 827,000 followers on Instagram.\n\u201cThis \u2018device\u2019 followed me for the last five hours to every location and [it belonged to] no one in my \u2018network.\u2019 It also wasn\u2019t a phone or tablet, it was an \u2018item,'\u201d she explained.\nThe Sports Illustrated stunner subsequently shared a screenshot of an AirTag via Instagram Stories: \u201c@Apple, did you take into consideration the danger and potentially fatal consequences this device has?\u201d\nShe added: \u201cFor those asking, it\u2019s not my AirTag, it\u2019s someone randoms, who must have slipped it into my belongings while out. Thank you all for checking in and sending helpful articles. I want this to be a PSA to all my ladies to please please check your belongings.\u201d\nAccording to Apple, it could alternatively help prevent stalking by notifying people if they have an AirTag device on their person that isn\u2019t registered to them.\n\u201cLadies, check your bags, coat, pockets and surroundings,\u201d the 26-year-old model urged her fans. Instagram / @brooksnader\n\u201cAirTag is designed to discourage unwanted tracking,\u201d the tech company states on its website. \u201cIf someone else\u2019s AirTag finds its way into your stuff, your iPhone will notice it\u2019s traveling with you and send you an alert.\u201d\nThe alert is what tipped Nader off to the fact an AirTag was in her coat pocket.\nA spokesperson for Apple told The Post, \u201cWe take customer safety very seriously and are committed to AirTag\u2019s privacy and security. AirTag is designed with a set of proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking \u2014 a first in the industry \u2014 and the Find My network includes a smart, tunable system with deterrents that applies to AirTag, as well as third-party products as part of the Find My network accessory program.\u201d\nThey added, \u201cWe are raising the bar on privacy for our users and the industry, and hope others will follow.\u201d\nNader is hardly the first woman to be stalked with the aid of Apple tech.\nIn Mississippi, a 27-year-old woman called police on Dec. 27 after receiving a notification on her iPhone that she had an unregistered AirTag on her person.\nBrooks Nader shared the terrifying tale with her 827,000 followers on Instagram. Instagram / @brooksnader\nThe AirTag is a shiny nickel-size tracker that will allow users to track keys and other small, easy-to-misplace items; however, it has been used by stalkers to follow women around town. Christopher Sadowski\nAlso last month, a Maryland woman took to Twitter to share her disturbing tale of a stalker attaching an AirTag to her car before she left a bar in the early hours of the morning.\nAnd, back in July, a Texas woman went viral on TikTok after revealing an AirTag had been placed in her purse and used by an unknown person to gauge her whereabouts.\nThey\u2019ve been a useful tool in recent thefts, too, particularly carjacking. In such cases, thieves will attach an AirTag to a vehicle in a parking lot and wait until the car and driver head back to their homes \u2014 where crooks find themselves more out of public view and steal the car right out of the owners\u2019 driveway.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nAn early app that made the iPhone look like you could pour beer from it, proved to be immensely lucrative \u2014 but the stress of mass popularity forced its magician creator to walk away.\nIt was a simpler time when the App Store opened in 2008. But while most novelty apps like fart noise ones faded away quickly, \"iBeer\" lasted much longer.\nAccording to a new Mel magazine interview with its magician creator, it also began long before the invention of the App Store.\n\"I built the very first iteration of this mechanism for the Palm Pilot,\" said creator Steve Sheraton, \"called E-spresso, which turned the little monochrome screen into a cup of coffee \u2014 but because it didn't have an accelerometer, I just made it a video that you could time with your drinking motion.\"\nTen years later, Sheraton made another video, and this time for the iPhone. Despite the then-new iPhone having an accelerometer and vivid color screen, Apple initially wasn't going to have an App Store.\nSheraton made a new video, this time with beer, and again users \"had to time your actions to match the video.\" He did it as YouTube video, while he was \"dead broke, just trying to get by,\" and that video got millions of views.\nHe redid that video as a downloadable iTunes one and sold it on the iTunes Store for $2.99.\n\"It was just a little video file that people had to hardwire in and download via iTunes,\" he says. \"But I probably made around $2,000 a day for the longest time from that.\"\nThe App Store was still not open, but Apple was looking for developers that would show off the iPhone's capabilities. They saw Sheraton's video and encouraged him to turn it into an app.\n\"The accelerometer is constantly measuring the phone's angle versus the horizon,\" explains Sheraton, \"so by tethering the line between the liquid and the foam to the horizon, you can move your phone in any direction and it looks like it's filled with liquid.\"\n\"From there, the rest is just a series of 'if statements, so 'if the tilt of the phone goes beyond X,'\" he continued, \"then the program should switch to different loops of foam and liquid that make it look like the phone is emptying.\"\nSheraton's $2.99 iBeer app \"shot to first place on the very first day and stayed there for about a year.\" He says that yes, it appealed to the lowest common denominator - iBeer 2.0 had an optional burp sound effect - but also that there was more to its success.\n\"[It] allowed people to show their friends what the phone was capable of,\" he says. \"You could show them maps and all these kinda geeky things, but iBeer was easier to understand and a funny, fun way to show off the iPhone's accelerometer and its bright screen with super lifelike colors.\"\nFinancial success\nBeing at the top of the App Store charts is still what developers wish for, but in the earliest days there was a lot of money to be earned. For Sheraton and the Hottrix company he formed, \"the amount of money was just so over-the-top.\"\n\"During our heyday, we were making $10,000 to $20,000 a day,\" he explains. \"[But the] app's sudden massive popularity and that lifestyle - coupled with all the publicity and stress that comes with it - is an avalanche that can destroy people.\"\nThe launch of an almost identical app called \"iPint\" by Coors Brewing Company saw Sheraton suing the developer. Following legal pressures and the stress of the whole operation, Sheraton stepped away.\n\"As a magician, I liked creating and inventing the act, but repeatedly performing it just kinda killed me,\" he explains. \"The app was similar - creating it and bringing it to the top was great fun, but then I had to move on and do something else.\"\nToday iBeer is owned by Sheraton's old Hottrix company, and Sheraton himself now lives on a farm in Spain. He creates apps for magicians - \"it's a niche market\" - and says he's glad to just be able to serve \"the needs of an industry I love.\"",

        "body": "As we\u2019ve rounded up multiple times so far, Apple has a number of new products set for release this year, ranging from the continuation of the Apple Silicon transition to the iPhone 14 and more. According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple is setting the stage to unveil the \u201cwidest array of new hardware products in its history\u201d this fall\u2026\nIn the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman explains that he\u2019s been told Apple is saving a number of its announcements for the fall. These announcements range from a completely redesigned MacBook Air to a new iPad Pro and more:\nTo that end, I\u2019m told that Apple is readying the widest array of new hardware products in its history this fall. That makes sense: My back-of-the-envelope list includes four new iPhones, a low-end MacBook Pro, an updated iMac, the new Mac Pro, a revamped MacBook Air, an AirPods Pro upgrade, three Apple Watches, a low-end iPad, and iPad Pros.\nGurman also doubles down on his previous reporting that Apple will hold its first event of the year sometime in March or April, with the iPhone SE being one of the products announced there. According to today\u2019s report, we shouldn\u2019t expect Apple to unveil its redesigned iPad Pro during the spring event. \u201cGiven the more significant changes in the pipeline for this year, I\u2019d expect the new iPad to come later than the spring,\u201d Gurman says.\nWith this in mind, Gurman expects Apple\u2019s spring event to focus on the iPhone SE 3, a new iPad Air, and potentially a new higher-end Mac of some sort. \u201cI\u2019d imagine Apple wants to bring the M1 Pro chip to another Mac in the first half of this year. That could mean a higher-end Mac mini or iMac,\u201d he writes.\nFor more details on the latest rumors surrounding all of these products, you can check out our full roundup right here. What are you most excited to see from Apple this year? Let us know down in the comments!",

        "title": "Apple Music is second worldwide with 15% market share; Spotify 31%",
        "body": "MIDiA\u2019s annual music subscriber market shares report is now available here (see below for more details of the report). Here are some of the key findings.\nThe global base of music subscribers continues to grow strongly with 523.9 million music subscribers at the end of Q2 2021, which was up by 109.5 million (26.4%) from one year earlier. Crucially, this was faster growth than the prior year. There is a difference between revenue and subscribers \u2013 with ARPU deflators, such as the rise of multi-user plans and the growth of lower-spending emerging markets \u2013 but growth in monetised users represents the foundation stone of the digital service provider (DSP) streaming market. So, accelerating growth at this relatively late stage of the streaming market\u2019s evolution is clearly positive.\nSpotify remains the DSP with the highest market share (31%), but this was down from 33% in Q2 2020 and 34% in Q2 2019. With Apple Music being a distant second with 15% market share, and Spotify adding more subscribers in the 12 months leading up to Q2 2021 than any other single DSP, there is no risk of Spotify losing its leading position anytime soon \u2013 but the erosion of its share is steady and persistent. Amazon Music once again out-performed Spotify in terms of growth (25% compared to 20%), but the standout success story among Western DSPs was YouTube Music, for the second successive year. Google was once the laggard of the space, but the launch of YouTube Music has transformed its fortunes, growing by more than 50% in the 12 months leading up to Q2 2021. YouTube Music was the only Western DSP to increase global market share during this the period. YouTube Music particularly resonates among Gen Z and younger Millennials, which should have alarm bells ringing for Spotify, as their core base of Millennial subscribers from the 2010s in the West are now beginning to age.\nBut the biggest subscriber growth came from emerging markets. Between them, Tencent Music Entertainment (TME) and NetEase Cloud Music added 35.7 million subscribers in the 12 months leading up to Q2 2021. Together, they accounted for 18% of global market shares, despite being available only in China. Yandex, in Russia, was the other big gainer, doubling its subscriber base to reach 2% of global market share.\nCombined, Yandex, TME and NetEase account for 20% of subscriber market share, but they drive 37% of all subscriber growth in the 12 months leading up to Q2 2021.\nThe strong growth in subscribers holds an extra meaning going into 2022. The surge in non-DSP streaming in 2021 means that the streaming market is no longer dependent on the revenue contribution of maturing Western subscriber markets (nor indeed ARPU-diluting emerging markets). With non-DSP streaming revenue looking set to have contributed between a quarter and a third of streaming revenue increase in 2021, streaming revenues look set for strong growth, even if subscriber growth lessens. That is what you call a diversified market.\nA little more detail on the subscriber market shares report:\nFeatured Report MIDiA Research 2020-2027 Global Music Forecasts Volume Trumps Value as Emerging Markets Dominate Growth This report presents the key figures, trends and drivers of MIDiA\u2019s music forecast model.

        "title": "Three Months After Launch, Apple Still Struggling to Meet Demand for Redesigned 14-Inch and 16-Inch MacBook Pro",
        "body": "Three months after their launch, the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros continue to experience high demand and seemingly short supply, with shipping dates for both models stretching into multiple weeks in several of Apple's key markets.\nIn the United States, the baseline 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip is estimated to ship in three to four weeks, promising an arrival by at least mid-February. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with the higher-end \u200cM1 Pro\u200c configuration or the M1 Max chip faces an even longer wait, heading well into at least early March.\nWith the larger 16-inch model, the baseline configuration is seeing five to six weeks for estimated delivery, with higher configurations seeing shipping dates estimated to be in late February or early March. In the United Kingdom and Canada, the highest-end 16-inch MacBook Pro shows shipping dates of between five and eight weeks on Apple's online store at the time of writing.\nThere are several reasons for the continued long wait that Apple customers are experiencing with Apple's latest MacBook Pros. Apple has continued to suffer the consequences of a global chip shortage that cost the company $6 billion last quarter, pandemic-related restrictions possibly limiting device production, on top of high demand for the latest laptops given their major redesign.\nWith the new MacBook Pros, Apple brought back many features highly requested by longtime Mac users, such as additional ports including HDMI, MagSafe, and an SD card slot. Apple also redesigned the MacBook Pros, making them heavier and thicker to accommodate the more powerful \u200cM1 Pro\u200c and \u200cM1 Max\u200c chips.\nApple will announce Q1 2022 earnings later this week where it's expected to provide insight on the sales of the iPhone 13, AirPods 3, the new MacBook Pros, and other new products it announced in the fall.",

        "title": "Commentary: Apple, please don't overthink your next external display: \u201c[A $3,500] product isn\u2019t what most of us are looking for.\u201d",
        "body": "Apple hasn\u2019t made an affordable high quality external display since 2016 when they retired the final iteration of the Thunderbolt Display. The company has a long history of offering the best possible mass market monitors for notebooks and desktops, dating back to the late 90s or the early days of the Studio Display. Apple\u2019s made a lot of weird decisions over the past decade and this certainly falls under that category. Now that the company has started to reboot the Mac and meet the needs of clamoring customers, it\u2019s time for them to step up and make the display we actually need.\nThe most recent external display from Apple is the Pro Display XDR, but it\u2019s not for most of us and it\u2019s certainly not a mass market product. There\u2019s no obvious option for regular Mac customers or even power users who don\u2019t need an advanced Hollywood studio reference display. And LG\u2019s ultra fine displays that Apple likes to promote feel cheap and plasticky, it\u2019s a travesty that they are acceptable to Apple.\nRumors of a new display\nRumors have started to pick up about a new more affordable Apple display that could come this year. Just this morning, Mark Gurman at Bloomberg reported that the company is indeed planning to release a display in 2022 that\u2019s half the price of the Pro Display XDR. But the Pro Display XDR is $6,000-$7,000 leaving this rumored display to be around $3,500 still. This product isn\u2019t what most of us are looking for. It\u2019s not even out yet and most customers in the market for an Apple display have been priced out.\nI fear that Apple is overthinking their external display strategy. Not every Apple customer is making multi-million dollar movies or editing professional photography. I know that we\u2019ve all been talking about this for years now, but the answer to this problem is staring us right in the face.\nStrip the iMac down\nApple launched the new 24-inch iMac in April of 2021 and it\u2019s proven to be a huge hit for the company. It revived an aging product line that desperately needed attention. It packs a gorgeous 24-inch 4.5K Retina display that has spectacular color reproduction and viewing angles. It also comes in an ultra thin beautiful package. It\u2019s not too big and not too small. It\u2019s arguably the perfect size.\nApple should take the same display that\u2019s in the 24-inch iMac, remove the computer and the chin and ship it as a display. One change I\u2019d make is to the foot, it should be able to move up and down just a bit to match the height of the iMac. The thin bezels make these a great candidate for sticking two together. There\u2019d be very little space between them for your cursor to cross. Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, they could offer the display in both silver and space gray. The silver model could have the same light gray bezel as the iMac, while the space gray one could adopt a matching black bezel. You could pick the right color based on your working space or even to match your machine.\nAffordable pricing\nThe iMac starts at just $1,299. That base model comes with a Magic Keyboard ($99) and a Magic Mouse ($79). Right off the bat, you can remove $180 off the price. Apple\u2019s displays don\u2019t need to come bundled with other accessories. Then remove the actual computer. I can\u2019t really say what the computer inside of the iMac would cost, but it\u2019s likely that the display itself is a more expensive component than anything on the motherboard. Apple could probably charge less, but to maintain a healthy margin they could sell their display for just $999. In fact, that\u2019s the price of the last consumer display that was retired in 2016.\nThat price is the sweet spot and it means that more people could have an Apple-designed display on their desk. There are so many individuals and organizations that have Thunderbolt displays on their last legs, this isn\u2019t a product category for the company to ignore. If Apple were to make a $999 display like this, they\u2019d start to appear all over the place.\nMammoth Lakes image credits: One, Two",

Read our ethics policy\n14-inch MacBook Pro\nIn late 2022, Apple is rumored to replace the current 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro with a new 14-inch model sporting an upgraded chip that's slightly more expensive.\nThe new 14-inch MacBook Pro will sport an \"M2\" chip and will arrive in the second half of 2022, reputable leaker DylanDKT said on Monday. In a subsequent tweet, DylanDKT added that the device will have the same design as the M1 Pro and M1 Max 14-inch model.\nThe currently available M1 MacBook Pro 13 will be replaced with a MacBook Pro 14 with an M2 chip in the 2H of 2022. It will receive a slight price increase over the previous generation. Alongside this release time frame, we will receive the redesigned M2 MacBook (Air). \u2014 Dylan (@dylandkt) January 17, 2022\nAlongside the new 13-inch MacBook Pro model, Apple will also release a new MacBook Air equipped with the same M2 chip, the leaker added.\nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 was first released in November 2020. Alongside the Mac mini and the MacBook Air, it was one of the first Mac models to be powered by a Apple Silicon chipset.\nUnlike the current M1 Max and M1 Pro models, the 13-inch device features a similar design to previous Intel MacBook Pros.\nIt isn't clear if the 13-inch model will come equipped with a broader range of ports like the 14-inch MacBook Pro, but a larger I/O selection remains an option if the new model will sport the same design.\nEarlier in January, reports claimed that a new MacBook Air model will have a \"marginally faster\" M2 chip. The M2 chip is expected to have a 10-core GPU, though upgrades to its CPU count or speed are unclear.",

        "title": "iPhone 14 Pro Again Rumored to Feature Upgraded 48-Megapixel Camera",
        "body": "iPhone 14 Pro models will feature a 48-megapixel camera, according to Taiwanese research firm TrendForce. Specifically, this refers to the rear-facing Wide camera, which is currently 12 megapixels on iPhone 13 Pro models.\nThe addition of a 48-megapixel Wide camera on iPhone 14 Pro models has already been mentioned by multiple sources, including analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who expects the upgraded camera to support 8K video recording.\nSimply increasing a smartphone camera's megapixel count while maintaining the same image sensor size results in smaller pixels, which allows less light to be captured, resulting in lower-quality low-light photos. As a solution, Kuo has previously said that iPhone 14 Pro models will support both 48-megapixel and 12-megapixel output, which would likely be achieved with a process known as pixel binning.\nAlready in use on some Android phones like Samsung's Galaxy S21 Ultra, pixel binning merges data from multiple smaller pixels on the camera's image sensor into one \"super-pixel\" for improved low-light sensitivity. Pixel binning would allow iPhone 14 Pro models to shoot high-resolution 48-megapixel photos in bright conditions and 12-megapixel photos in low-light conditions that are still of higher quality.\niPhone 14 Pro models would likely shoot 12-megapixel photos by default given the large file size of 48-megapixel photos, but Apple's implementation remains to be seen.\nApple is expected to announce four new iPhone 14 models in September, including a 6.1-inch iPhone 14, 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Max, 6.1-inch iPhone 14 Pro, and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro Max, with a 48-megapixel camera available on the latter two devices.",

Now yet another example of this feature saving a life has been reported in the City of Morrow, Clayton County, Georgia.\nAccording to local CB546 News Atlanta, an elderly resident fell while outside his property on January 23, 2022. His Watch detected the fall and, when he failed to respond that he was okay, alerted the Clayton County Emergency Communications Center.\n\"Since an Apple Watch initiated the call, the location of the call could only be determined by the watch's GPS, which reported the closest address,\" said\nCity of Morrow Fire Department Deputy Chief Jeff Moss. \"The Morrow Fire Department crew arrived on the scene with Morrow Police units and quickly noticed that the physical address was not where the patient was located and began a search of the perimeter.\"\nThe man was found nearby, reportedly in a semi-conscious, confused and extremely cold state. The total time between his Apple Watch calling for help and the man being found was 12 minutes.\nHe was taken to hospital for treatment and later released. According to emergency services, the extreme cold and an unspecified ongoing medical condition mean that the outcome could have \"undoubtedly\" been worse, without the Apple Watch.",

        "title": "Google Basically Pays Apple to Stay Out of the Search Engine Business, Class Action Lawsuit Alleges",
        "body": "Apple has an agreement with Google that it won't develop its own internet search engine so long as Google pays it to remain the default option in Safari, a new class action alleges.\nFiled in a California court earlier this week against Apple, Google, and their respective CEOs, the lawsuit alleges the two companies have a non-compete agreement in the internet search business that violates US antitrust laws.\nSpecifically, the complaint charges Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai of participating in \"regular secret meetings\" in which Google agrees to share its profits with Apple if it is given preferential treatment on devices like the iPhone and iPad.\nThe class action also alleges that Google pays Apple annual multi-billion-dollar payments based on an agreement that Apple won't launch its own competing search engine, and that the non-compete agreement includes plans to actively suppress smaller competitors and acquire actual and potential competitors.\nThe complaint claims that advertising rates are subsequently higher than rates would be in a competitive system. It therefore seeks an injunction prohibiting the non-compete agreement between Google and Apple, a cessation of the profit-sharing agreement and preferential treatment, and an end to the multi-billion dollar payments.\nLastly, the complaint calls for \"the breakup of Google into separate and independent companies and the breakup of Apple into separate and independent companies in accordance with the precedent of the breakup of Standard Oil company into Exxon, Mobile, Conoco, Amoco, Sohio, Chevron, and others.\"\nIt's no secret Apple and Google have a considerable monetary agreement that ensures Google's position as the default search engine on Apple devices. Neither company has ever confirmed exactly how much Google pays to be the default search engine on Apple devices in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries, but it's rumored to be in the billions.\nIn 2020, The New York Times reported that Apple receives an estimated $8-12 billion per year in exchange for making Google the default search on its devices. According to one analyst, Google's payment to Apple in 2021 to maintain this status quo may have reached up to $15 billion.\nThis is believed to be the single biggest payment Google makes to anyone, and could account for up to a fifth of Apple's annual profits. But it has also drawn scrutiny in the past, in particular from the US Justice Department, which claims that the deal is representative of illegal tactics used to protect Google's monopoly and stifle competition.\nThe UK Competition and Markets Authority has also called the arrangement a \"significant barrier to entry and expansion\" for rivals in the search engine market, and in 2020 asked for enforcement authorities to be provided with a range of options to address the deal between Apple and Google to provide a more level playing field for other search engines.\nBringing the antitrust case to a San Francisco court this week, lawyer Joseph M Alioto said: \"These powerful companies abused their size by unlawfully foreclosing and monopolizing major markets which in an otherwise free enterprise system would have created jobs, lowered prices, increased production, added new competitors, encouraged innovations, and increased the quality of services in the digital age.\"\nApple and Google would likely argue that while the payments are indeed for Google to remain the default search option, users can select other search engines in Safari including Microsoft's Bing, Apollo Fund's Yahoo, and independent search engines DuckDuckGo and Ecosia.\nApple would also likely point out that it is already in the search engine business and maintains an active web crawler, called Applebot. The crawler chiefly operates in the background to improve \u200cSiri\u200c and Spotlight search results, although past reports have interpreted Applebot's increased activity as Apple \"stepping up efforts\" to develop its own search technology should its agreement with Google become incompatible with antitrust laws.",

        "title": "PSA: Face ID unlock when wearing a mask in iOS 15.4 works with Apple Pay and apps",
        "body": "One of the best surprises that came with iOS 15.4 beta, which was released Thursday for developers, is a new option to enable Face ID when wearing a mask without the need to have an Apple Watch. What\u2019s even better about this feature is that it works with Apple Pay and even apps.\nAs we previously covered here, iOS 15.4 beta features a new \u201cUse Face ID With a Mask\u201d option, which lets users rescan their faces to unlock the iPhone when wearing a mask. While this was already possible for users who own an Apple Watch, there are some differences between the two options.\nAside from the most obvious difference, which is not needing an Apple Watch paired to the iPhone, the new Face ID unlock when wearing a mask included with iOS 15.4 works system-wide.\nUsers can authenticate with Apple Pay and even log into third-party apps with Face ID enabled when wearing a mask, something that\u2019s not possible when using the Unlock with Apple Watch option \u2013 which only unlocks the phone and nothing else. Even Safari\u2019s AutoFill works with the new unlock when wearing a mask in the iOS 15.4 beta.\nWhile the Apple Watch Unlock option remains available to users, it\u2019s likely that most users will prefer the new unlock method since it works with iPhone apps. It\u2019s worth noting that setting up Face ID to work with masks requires an iPhone 12 or iPhone 13, so users with iPhone 11 or previous models still rely on Unlock with Apple Watch.\niOS 15.4 beta is now available for developers, while the official release is expected this spring.\nRead also:",

Check. No license plate? Check. Handicap spot? Yep, this is Steve Jobs\u2019 car!!!\u201d she writes.\nJobs, of course, has a long history of parking in handicapped parking spaces at Apple.

See the pictures after the jump.\nVia ValleyWag.\nJobs drives a Mercedes SL55 AMG, a super fast, $130,000 sports car.

You\u2019d expect Jobs to plump for the best.\nApple veteran Andy Hertzfled reports on his history of the Mac website, Folklore.org, that Jobs was constantly parking in the restricted spaces. \u201cHe seemed to think the blue wheelchair symbol meant the spot was reserved for the chairman,\u201d Hertzfeld writes.\nIn a comment to Hertzfeld\u2019s post, Dan Cochran, who worked at Apple, noted that one day someone converted the handicapped \u201cwheelchair\u201d graphic into the Mercedes logo.\n\u201cI thought it was hilarious but as I recall Steve didn\u2019t find it particularly funny at all,\u201d he notes.\nQuipped former Apple executive, Jean-Louis Gassee, when he saw Jobs park in a restricted spot: \u201cI never realized those spaces were for the emotionally handicapped\u2026\u201d (According to Wikiquote, Jean-Louis now says morally handicapped when retelling the story.)\nMarch 3, 2006 Photo by steevil\nJanuary 13, 2007 Photo by brianamerige In the caption, the photographer says: \u201cJobs didn\u2019t really seem to care about the car much.

        "body": "Apple's second-generation AirPods Pro will feature support for Lossless audio and a charging case that can emit a sound for location tracking purposes, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nIn a note to investors, seen by MacRumors, Kuo explained that the second-generation \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c will feature new selling points that will lead to strong demand, including support for Apple Lossless (ALAC) audio and a charging case that users can trigger a sound from to highlight its location.\nIt seems likely that this sound-emitting charging case will integrate into the Find My app, similar to how users can currently emit a sound from their individual AirPods inside the case to help find them. This lines up with alleged leaked photos of the next-generation AirPods Pro, which showed a charging case with speaker holes to emit a sound for location tracking, allowing the earbuds and the case to be located separately.\nAll of Apple's current AirPods products, including the third-generation AirPods, \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c, and AirPods Max, do not support Lossless audio. This is because AirPods play audio via Bluetooth, limiting them to the AAC codec. Higher quality Apple Lossless Audio Codec files may need to be streamed to AirPods directly to circumvent Bluetooth and enable a Lossless listening experience, but it is possible that Apple could develop an alternative solution.\nKuo also reiterated that the next-generation earbuds will feature a new design and launch in the fourth quarter of 2022, which is slightly later than the third-quarter prediction suggested by other rumors. Kuo still believes that AirPods may support health monitoring features in the future, but did not directly associate this rumor with the second-generation \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c.",
