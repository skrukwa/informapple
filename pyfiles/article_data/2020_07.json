        "body": "Apple Is Killing a Billion-Dollar Ad Industry With One Popup\nThe new iOS 14 privacy feature spells trouble for advertisement agencies and promises to end an era of personalized ads Anupam Chugh \u00b7 Follow Published in Big Tech Talks \u00b7 \u00b7 Jul 7, 2020 4 min read -- 134 Share\nPhoto by Tobias Moore on Unsplash\nWhen Apple\u2019s WWDC 2020 digital-only Keynote event kickstarted, all eyes were on the new mac OS Big Sur and the ambitious Apple Silicon chips.\nBut from the perspective of advertisement agencies, it was the new iOS 14 privacy-based features that sent shockwaves in their industry and became the major talking point.\nFor the uninitiated, a lot of apps today use an Advertising identifier (IDFA). It allows developers and marketers to track activity for advertising purposes.\nPlenty of marketing agencies backed by Google and Facebook run campaigns to record purchases, usage time, user actions, and subsequently serve personalized ads.\nOver 100K apps on the App Store today have the Facebook or Google SDK integrated to track and send your data to third-party brokers.\nBut iOS 14 is all set to change that by being upfront and transparent with users about how their data is used for ads.\niOS 14 brings an opt-in dialog for the ad-tracking feature that will cripple agencies\nLast year, Apple introduced a limited ad tracking feature for iOS 13 that was buried deep in your phone\u2019s privacy settings. iOS 14 now brings that to the forefront of your apps.\nWhen iOS 14 rolls out to the public this fall, users would be greeted with a dialog that asks them to \u201cAllow Tracking\u201d or \u201cAsk App Not To Track\u201d their ad identifiers. No user in their right consciousness would look to opt-in for personalized ads considering it's used for monetization purposes.\nThis makes Apple\u2019s own IDFA obsolete as advertising agencies can\u2019t use it to precisely retarget a specific user.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nPrinted passports may become a thing of the past\nThe next step in Apple's goal of making the iPhone the sole thing anyone has to carry, continues with the device being able to securely replace passports, driver's licenses, and other physical forms of identification.\nApple most recently announced a plan to rid the world of car keys, but the iPhone has already made us forget what it's like to carry diaries, cameras, pens, and even mirrors. Now the company is focusing on getting rid of passports \u2014 plus library cards, ski passes, and ID cards in general.\nA series of slightly different patent applications, all entitled \"Providing Verified Claims of User Identity,\" detail methods by which a user's ID can be recorded or transmitted \u2014 and confirmed. Apple does not use the word iPhone once, but instead refers hundreds of times to devices that could be any piece of technology.\n\"A device implementing a system for using a verified claim of identity includes at least one processor configured to receive a verified claim including information to identify a user of a device,\" says one such application, \"the verified claim being signed by a server based on verification of the information by an identity verification provider separate from the server, the verified claim being specific to the device.\"\nUnder this proposal, a device such as an iPhone could securely transmit some form of ID. If the owner of the device is already verified, say by the biometric sensors in Apple Watch, that verifies the ID being sent.\nWhile Apple's application chiefly refers to passports, it's intended that one system be used for many things. \"[This] allows a user to obtain a verified claim of identity that serves as a digital identity for the user, that includes information for identifying the user (e.g., information that was provided by the user and verified by one or more systems), and that can be re-used across different service providers,\" says the application.\nThe five borderline-identical patent applications discuss features such as the user's choice to opt-in to providing ID, and technical details of how the data can be securely transmitted. All five are credited to the same six inventors, including Christopher Sharp and Gianpaolo Fasoli, both of whom have prior related patents such as \"Data verification via independent processors of a device.\"\nThat, Sharp's other patent regarding \"Methods and apparatus for user authentication and human intent verification in mobile devices,\" and these five are far from Apple's first research into iPhone as ID.\nDetail from the patent showing that ID may be securely transmitted and received by every type of Apple device\nPreviously, Apple has worked on secure ways of presenting government ID, and it has worked with both German and UK governments to help local identification projects.\nApple's vice president of internet services and Apple Pay, has publicly said that the company wants to provide ID, but also that it's difficult.\n\"Identity, to be legal, it has to be government, it has to be authenticated by the government,\" she said in 2019. \"We see, across the globe, many countries starting to use mobile to add a passport.",

        "body": "Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said on Thursday that upcoming changes to Apple's iOS 14 operating system could hurt the social network's ability to target ads to users.\nWith the update to its mobile devices, Apple will ask users if they want to let app developers track their activity across other apps and websites. Apple has not said when iOS 14 will launch, but it's expected to roll out this year.\n\"We're still trying to understand what these changes will look like and how they will impact us and the rest of the industry, but at the very least, it's going to make it harder for app developers and others to grow using ads on Facebook and elsewhere,\" Wehner said.\nUntil now, advertisers could use a device ID number called the IDFA to better target ads and estimate their effectiveness. In iOS 14, each app that wants to use these identifiers will ask users to opt-in to tracking when the app is first launched.\nThe change is expected to start impacting Facebook's advertising in the third quarter but it will have a more pronounced effect in the fourth quarter, Wehner said.\nThe company forecast revenue growth for the third quarter of about 10%, beating analysts' expectations for growth of 7.9%.\n\"Our view is that Facebook and targeted ads are a lifeline for small businesses, especially in the time of Covid, and we are concerned that aggressive platform policies will cut at that lifeline at a time when it is so essential to small business growth and recovery,\" Wehner said.\nWATCH: Facebook beats top and bottom line in Q2",

        "body": "Outline of the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act\nSenators Graham, Blackburn, and Cotton call the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act (press release): \"a bill to bolster national security interests and better protect communities across the country by ending the use of \u201cwarrant-proof\u201d encrypted technology by terrorists and other bad actors to conceal illicit behavior\".\nThey justify the proposed bill with the threat from terrorists and pedophiles: \"Tech companies\u2019 increasing reliance on encryption has turned their platforms into a new, lawless playground of criminal activity. Criminals from child predators to terrorists are taking full advantage\", says Cotton. He wants to \"end the Wild West of crime on the Internet\".\nInstead, Cotton wants to open the Wild West for law enforcement and the authorities. Once surveillance laws such as an encryption backdoor for the \"good guys\" is available, it's just a matter of time until the \"good guys\" turn bad or abuse their power. History has taught us that often enough so we should be able to understand the threat of an Orwellian-like surveillance by the government. In Germany alone, we had two oppressive governments in the last one hundred years that taught us why government surveillance is very dangerous: the GDR and Nazi Germany.\nPublic opinion objects to an encryption backdoor\nBy stressing the fact that tech companies must decrypt sensitive information only after a court issues a warrant, the three Senators believe they can swing the public opinion in favor of this encryption backdoor law.\nHowever, the backbone of the internet relies on unbreakable encryption. We need it for banking, for storing sensitive documents, for having a private communication online. Of course, the Senators argue that the backdoor they are demanding would be only available to the 'good guys' only. However, cryptography experts have already explored in detail if and how an encryption backdoor could be realized.\nThe conclusion has always been the same: While implementing a backdoor is easy, limiting its access to the 'good guys' only is impossible.\nHow would such a backdoor work?\nTo comply with decryption orders such as demanded by the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act, online services would need to have central access to all encrypted data, possibly with a general decryption key. When being presented with a court order, they would have to decrypt the data of this particular user - leaving the data of all other users untouched.\nThis process is done by employees, by people. Consequently, one can imagine how hard - if not impossible - it would be to secure the general key from abuse and mistakes. Particularly when considering the high value that such a general key would have to malicious attackers, state actors (also from abroad), and others.\nWith the constantly rising number of breaches, shown by this data breach report, one can imagine that it would not take long before some malicious actor on the internet got access to this general key, rendering all encryption for all users futile.\nHow devastating this would be, becomes obvious when looking at one of the most severe data breaches of 2020: The so-called BlueLeaks breach exposed files from hundreds of US police departments, including personal information of suspects and convicted criminals alike.\nStop the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act\nJust like the EARN IT bill, we must stop the proposed Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act. Please take action and stop this attack on encryption of US companies. Here is how.",

        "title": "Nearly 70% of iOS users will deny tracking permissions if they are requested in-app to opt-in",
        "body": "Nearly 70% of iOS and Android users will deny tracking permissions if they are requested in-app to opt-in | In App monetization In Market Research | By By Andreas Vourkos\nLast week, at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple announced some new privacy and security features for iOS. With the new changes publishers will be required to provide information about their app\u2019s data collection practices and also explicitly ask their users for their permission to track them, across apps and websites owned by other companies.This is a major change for the industry, since so far, users were required to opt-out if they wanted from sharing their data and identifiers with third party networks. Now, with the new changes, users will have to explicitly opt-in within their apps to allow tracking or sharing of their data.\nThe upcoming changes will make it harder for advertisers and marketers to track and target users across apps, creating a level of uncertainty on how that industry will work from now on. The changes are expected to improve transparency on users\u2019 privacy, but they will also have an impact on the current app\u2019s economy and how apps monetize. Some of the most important players in that space such as ad networks and attribution networks will be immediately affected.\nThe big question is how will iOS users react to the latest changes once the new privacy features start rolling out later this year?\nVery few believe that users will opt in to share their data with third parties or allow tracking of them, especially with the way that Apple proposes to communicate that to the users.\nAs the mobile apps landscape becomes more unified on how privacy is handled, those changes could also come to Android soon. Is there any differentiation on how Android users would react in similar changes around privacy?\nPollfish ran two studies of 1000 respondents each in the US, one on iOS and one on Android to measure how iOS and Android users would react to the upcoming privacy changes.\n68.3% of iOS and 67.5% of Android users will likely deny tracking permissions if they are requested in-app to opt-in.\nThere is an active conversation in the industry, if app owners would be allowed to incentivize users with some sort of virtual goods, in exchange for giving permission to track them. In the same surveys, both iOS and Android users were asked what they would do in that scenario and it seems that around 15% of the users (14.2% of iOS and 14.9% of Android users) would change their mind.\n38.6% of iOS and 38.1% of Android users would potentially allow themselves to be tracked, if there was some virtual reward in exchange.\nIn the current permission popup suggested by Apple, the app owners can add a small amount of text in the description, to explain the reasoning behind requesting the tracking permission. In the surveys, users were asked if they would change their preference, if they were to receive a proper explanation from the app owners, prior or within the popup. Around 22% of the users (20.4% of iOS and 24% of Android users) would potentially change their preference.\n44.8% of iOS and 47.2% of Android users would potentially allow themselves to be tracked, if app owners were to give them proper reasoning in advance.\nFrom respondents participating in the surveys, 52.5% on iOS did not know that they could Limit Ad Tracking at the moment, in their iPhone\u2019s settings area. Of those, 42.43% have the option enabled and 56.6% of them stated that they have limited tracking enabled due to privacy concerns.\nIn a similar question to Android users, 42.6% were not aware of the option to Opt out from interest based ads and from those that knew that setting, 51.27% have already opted out. 46.41% stated that they opted out due to privacy concerns.\nTo conclude, upcoming privacy changes in iOS are about to make a big impact on how apps monetize their audience and how advertising and attribution networks work. The study showed that a large proportion of the users will not allow themselves to be tracked, a crucial step in effectively running and attributing ad campaigns in the apps space at the moment. Similar findings were also revealed with Android users. Privacy seems to be a key concern among users in the mobile space and by providing them with more transparency and choices, seems to change the current landscape dramatically.",

        "body": "Apple recently announced that the next versions of iOS and macOS will include support for handling encrypted DNS communications.\nIn a presentation at WWDC 2020, the company said that when iOS 14 and macOS 11 release this fall, both operating systems will support DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and DNS-over-TLS (DoT).\nWhen a user visits a website, their browser sends domain name system (DNS) queires to DNS servers which translate domain names into IP addresses. Traditionally these queries are not encrypted and sent in clear text which has allowed third parties and even Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to snoop on the websites users visit online.\nBy using DoH or DoT, web browsers and apps can make DNS queries and receive DNS responses in an encrypted format and this helps prevent unwanted tracking online.\nEncrypted DNS\nApple will add new functions and features to its app development frameworks to allow developers to either create new apps or update their existing apps to use either DoH or DoT to encrypt DNS traffic.\nAccording to Apple software engineer Tommy Pauly who gave the presentation, developers can create apps to apply DoH or DoT settings to the entire operation system, to individual apps or to an app's selected network requests.\nDevelopers will also be able to write \u201crules\u201d to enable support for encrypted DNS communications only in certain situations or contexts. For example, encrypted DNS could be turned on when a user leaves their corporate network and switches to mobile data while away from the office or traveling.\nIf for some reason a network provider decides to block encrypted DNS communications on their network, Apple is planning to warn users with a message that explains that the names of websites and other servers their device accesses on that network could be monitored and recorded.\nThe addition of encrypted DNS is great news for iPhone, iPad and Mac users though Apple is a bit late to the party as Mozilla, Google and Microsoft already support encrypted DNS communications in their respective software.\nAlso check out our complete list of the best antivirus software\nVia ZDNet",

This is said to have a \"dramatic impact on battery and performance.\" Google has reportedly been performing early tests on Mac laptops in particular.\n\"This is an ongoing investment in improvements to speed, performance and battery life,\" said Max Christoff, director of Chrome browser engineering. Chrome has previously been criticized for poor use of RAM, battery draining, and privacy concerns.\nIn May, Google set out plans to improve Chrome battery toll by blocking resource-heavy ads. Chrome will also limit the resources that an ad can use before the user interacts with it. In addition to this, Chrome will soon be updated with new optimization that will allow the most performance-critical parts of the software to run even faster.\nGoogle is currently experimenting with the changes, with the intention of releasing the optimizations and improvements to Chrome in a stable release towards the end of August.",

The iPads are for each student\u2019s use throughout their time at Bowdoin. If, upon graduation, seniors express a need to retain the devices, they may do so for one dollar but are otherwise encouraged to return them so they may be used by other students who will benefit from them.\nLearn more about Bowdoin's iPad Initiative.",

        "title": "Apple Makes a Major Privacy Move by Allowing Users to Disable Ad Tracking and Have Greater Insight Into App Permissions",
        "body": "The headline announcement from Apple\u2019s 2020 Worldwide Developers Conference was that users would be getting an unprecedented level of control over personal privacy, enough that it might entirely upend mobile marketing on iOS. The headline item was that users would be able to selectively disable ad tracking by making their unique ID invisible to certain apps, but a suite of other enhanced privacy features was introduced: more detailed breakdowns of app permissions, new indicator lights and new Safari screening features among them.\nThe changes to Apple ads will be coming with the new iOS 14 operating system, which is expected to be released sometime in September.\nApple puts an (optional) end to ad tracking in individual apps\nThe biggest news is that Apple device users will now be able to opt out of Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) tracking on an app-by-app basis. As the name indicates, this unique device ID is provided to marketers primarily for targeted advertising purposes. While it is supposed to be randomized and not tied to any personally identifying information, developers would sometimes overstep intended boundaries with it when using it for traffic analytics purposes.\nThe system will be opt-in at the user end, but will proactively display a warning before running each new app indicating that it wants to track users \u201cacross other apps and websites.\u201d A screenshot of the warning is phrased in such a way that it looks like users will overwhelmingly opt in.\nThe move follows over a year of campaigning by various groups, with Mozilla playing a key role. Mozilla ran a petition for monthly rotation of IDFAs in 2019 that gathered 20,000 signatures, and sponsored a poll late in the year that indicated half of all iPhone users did not know that the identification number existed or that it was used to track users.\nThe marketing industry is bracing for a significant hit to the mobile advertising business, assuming that most users will choose to opt out of ad tracking when presented with this warning notification. There is an existing ability to opt out of some IDFA ad tracking in iOS, but it requires users to go through the settings menu and does not allow them to pick and choose access for individual apps. A marketing study from March indicates that only about 30% of iOS users have enabled this \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d feature.\nOther iOS 14 privacy improvements\nChanges are also coming to Apple\u2019s location tracking settings in iOS, which in turn will likely have an impact on any kind of ad tracking (whether IDFA or third-party systems). Users will now be able to limit apps to accessing approximate data rather than a precise location, allowing for the use of location-dependent features while adding a substantial layer of privacy protection.\nApp permission lists are now also going to be divided into separate categories, with one unique list designed to highlight data that is specifically used to track users. And Safari will have a new \u201cprivacy report\u201d button located near the URL bar, which will display all third-party trackers on a given website and allow users to selectively disable them. This may strike an additional blow to ad tracking as it gives users greater and more convenient visibility into third-party advertising campaigns that do not rely on the IDFA.\nFocusing on hardware\nThe move to effectively dump ad tracking from Apple devices signals a doubling down on the company\u2019s privacy-first branding and strategy of focusing on high-priced hardware sales to a more affluent consumer base willing to stay within the company\u2019s curated and secure \u201cwalled garden\u201d of software. It\u2019s also possible that the company sees this as a simpler way to navigate a global regulatory landscape that is increasingly favoring strict privacy protections for end users.\nThe move is not necessarily a total net positive for users of iOS devices, however, as app developers are not likely to simply roll over and let their ad networks die. Instead, it is quite likely they will switch to other schemes that are less convenient and potentially more intrusive for the end user. For example, more apps might require users to create accounts with the developer and log in before using. Some free apps may opt to simply switch to a paid model rather than attempt to serve ads.\nNew #iOS 14 allows #Apple users to selectively disable ad tracking by making their unique IDs invisible to apps. #privacy #respectdata\nClick to Tweet\nThere is some chance that Google will have Android follow suit at some point in the near future, as the search giant has been known to copy Apple\u2019s user data privacy moves (such as ending support for third-party cookies in Chrome) albeit with a substantial amount of lag time. This move is less certain, however, as Google is much more dependent on marketing and ad tracking revenue than Apple is.",

        "title": "You can upgrade an Apple iPod Classic with an M.2 SSD fit for a PC",
        "body": "The Apple iPod Classic is a piece of technology that will go down in history as best in class. There's no PC/Mac rivalry here, these are just the facts, and I still use mine on long journeys to this day. But even MP3 royalty grows old, and the iPod's spinning platter HDD is certainly showing its age in an era of solid state. But what if you could swap it out for something a little faster?\nThe iPod Classic was discontinued way back in 2014, and I'd take a guess and say most still alive and kicking are quite a bit older than that, too. That's quite a long time for a HDD to be operating for, and it would usually be a death sentence for most batteries, too (somehow my iPod, despite a multi-year sabbatical from operation, still has a multi-day battery).\nBut rather than accept your device is teetering on death, how about going about modding it for yourself? That very upgrade is possible thanks to a bespoke modding part from iFlash: the iFlash-Sata v10. It's built to accommodate one M.2 SATA SSD (note: SATA, not NVMe) at a size of 2242 (a little shy of the default drive size of 2280).\nThat's exactly the kit used by YouTube channel DankPods, who set about this very mod in their latest video titled 'PC SSDs in an iPod Classic'. Guess what they go about modding into the iPod Classic? That's right, an M.2 SSD fit for a desktop machine. And it works a treat, too.\nYour next upgrade (Image credit: Future) Best CPU for gaming: the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card: your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming: get into the game ahead of the rest\nThat is, if you ignore that the drive (and most of the buttons, in fact) are hanging off the iPod being modded. That's largely to down to user error on DankPod's part, who has a history of jury-rigging things together, and who I hope doesn't mind if I say made a rather simple, but debilitating, error this time around: buying a 2280 SSD that is near-enough the length of an iPod by itself.\nAt least they tread that ground so that you know what not to do. Granted, there are a few other drawbacks, too. For one, the famed lifespan of the iPod Classic will take a rather dramatic turn when using an M.2 SSD. Also it may need a little tinkering every so often to sync up to your machine. Oh, and it also does get quite hot.\nPerhaps it's best to follow DankPod's expert advice and settle for the less speedy but far more convenient SD card iFlash mod board instead.",

        "title": "Intel's 7nm is Broken, Company Announces Delay Until 2022, 2023",
        "body": "(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\nIntel announced today in its Q2 2020 earnings release that it has now delayed the rollout of its 7nm CPUs by six months relative to its previously-planned release date, undoubtedly resulting in wide-ranging delays to the company's roadmaps that could cause the company to lose ranks in our CPU Benchmark Hierarchy. Intel's press release also says that yields for its 7nm process are now twelve months behind the company's internal targets, meaning the company isn't currently on track to produce its 7nm process in an economically viable way. The company now says its 7nm CPUs will not debut on the market until late 2022 or early 2023.\nHere's the snippet from Intel's press release:\n\"The company's 7nm-based CPU product timing is shifting approximately six months relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of Intel's 7nm process, which based on recent data, is now trending approximately twelve months behind the company's internal target.\"\nOn the earnings call, Intel CEO Bob Swan said the company had identified a \"defect mode\" in its 7nm process that caused yield degradation issues. As a result, Intel has invested in \"contingency plans,\" which Swan later defined as including using third-party foundries. The company will also use external third-party foundries for its forthcoming 7nm Ponte Vecchio GPUs, the company's first graphics chips. Ponte Vecchio comes as a chiplet-based design, and Swan clarified that production for some of the chiplets (tiles) will be outsourced to third parties. Swan noted the GPUs will come in late 2021 or early 2022, portending a delay beyond the original schedule for a 2021 launch in the exascale Aurora supercomputer.\nIntel's first 7nm server CPUs (Granite Rapids) will arrive in 2023, which is later than listed in earlier roadmaps that projected a launch in 2022. That timeline is concerning in the face of AMD's continued execution with its EPYC data center chips \u2013 AMD's roadmaps outline its 5nm Genoa processors coming to market before the end of 2022. Swan also said that Intel's first 7nm processors will debut for the client market, meaning chips targeting either desktop PCs or laptops. Intel's first 10nm desktop CPUs, Alder Lake, will arrive in the second half of 2021.\nFor perspective, rival foundry TSMC plans to be on the 3nm node in the same time frame as Intel's new schedule for 7nm. Intel clearly isn't pleased with its execution on the 7nm node, as an embattled Swan remarked that \"And we feel pretty good about where we are, though we\u2019re not happy. I\u2019m not pleased with our 7nm process performance\" at the end of the call after a bruising question and answer session with analysts. Swan also said \"we have root-caused the [7nm] issue and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks,\" and that the company would provide further updates at an upcoming Architecture Day.\nSwan said the company had a built-in buffer in its roadmap to account for process node delays. That accomodation comes as a result of hard-learned lessons from the company's incessant 10nm delays. Intel says it will use its advanced packaging technologies, which allow it to mix and match components produced from external sources with its own chips, to help reconcile the six month delay to its 7nm processors with the year-long delay to its internal 7nm yield projections. Swan also noted that Intel could use third-party foundries for entire chip designs. In the past, Intel stated that it would also enable newer architectures to be portable to older nodes, so it's plausible that Intel could resort to back-porting some architectures as part of its contingency plan.\nThe 7nm delay reflects yet another setback as Intel still struggles to overcome the multi-year yield issues it has encountered with its 10nm process. Those delays have allowed its competitors, like AMD, to wrest the process node leadership position from Intel for the first time in the company's history. That's triggered a price war in the market as Intel fights a true x86 competitor with a better node, not to mention Amazon's new Graviton 2 ARM chips based on TSMC's 7nm node. Apple also recently announced that it is transitioning from Intel's chips to its own ARM-based 7nm silicon. The 7nm delay also exacerbates the recent news that rock star chip architect Jim Keller, who was a key part of a team effort to revitalize the company's roadmaps, has left the company.\n(Image credit: Intel)\nIntel CFO George Davis has previously indicated that the company's process tech would lag its its competitors until 7nm arrived in 2021, and that the company would regain the lead with its 5nm process at an undefined time:\n\"So we bring a lot of capability to the table for our customers, in addition to the CPU, and we feel like we're starting to see the acceleration on the process side that we have been talking about to get back to parity in the 7nm generation and regain leadership in the 5nm generation.\"\nThat plan to regain a competitive footing has now obviously shifted due to the 7nm delay. Intel had planned to speed the delivery of its 7nm node to offset the underperforming 10nm, which it said would not perform as well as other nodes. At the time, Davis noted that the company was trying to be clear with investors about the impacts of 10nm on the company's gross margins: \"...but the fact is that I wanted to be clear what was happening during the 10nm generation. The fact is, it isn't going to be as strong a node as people would expect from 14nm or what they'll see in 7nm.\"\nIn regards to the 10nm node, Davis commented: \"As we said back at our analyst day in May of 19: Look, this isn't just going to be the best node that Intel has ever had. It's going to be less productive than 14nm, less productive than 22nm, but we're excited about the improvements that we're seeing and we expect to start the 7nm period with a much better profile of performance over that starting at the end of 2021.\"\n\"Also, we were at a time when in order to regain process leadership we had to accelerate the overlap between 10nm, 7nm, and then 7nm and 5nm, so the cost that you're absorbing, starting in particular in 2021, you\u2019ve got this intersection of the performance of 10nm, the investment in 7nm, and were also well into starting the investment in 5nm: All of those elements just combine to impact gross margin.\"\nToday Intel said that it plans to increase its shipments of 10nm chips by 20% over its prior projections, so it appears the company's 10nm plans have shifted out of necessity. Intel's new plan centers on gaining another 'full node' of performance from its current 10nm node, meaning 10nm may have longer legs than the company expected when it announced last year that it would accelerate 7nm production. Intel pulled off a similar feat with its 14nm processors through a series of \"+\" revisions that added incremental performance improvements, so it does have a track record of successful inter-node improvements that could help it remain competitive until it can correct the issues with its 7nm process.\nIntel has also traditionally used third-party fabs, currently to the tune of ~20% of its production, for low-margin, non-CPU products built on trailing-edge nodes. Intel's new plans to more aggressively leverage external fabs could result in it using other fabs for its core logic, like CPUs and GPUs, which the company hasn't done in the past. As Swan noted, that will present challenges in maintaining attractive ASPs for Intel's products, especially given the scale of its production needs. Ultimately, Intel could also face significantly reduced margins if it outsources significant portions of its fabrication of high-margin products, like CPUs, to third parties. Relying upon an outside vendor for leading-edge node production also incurs more risk in terms of supply assurance as Intel could be forced to compete with deep-pocketed rival semiconductor companies, like Apple, Nvidia and AMD, among others, for production capacity.",

        "body": "Apple is moving away from Intel\u2019s chipsets in favor of its new, custom-designed ARM chips \u2014 but the company is promising that it\u2019ll still support Intel\u2019s Thunderbolt USB-C connectivity standard on new Apple silicon computers, despite the lack of Intel processors.\n\u201cOver a decade ago, Apple partnered with Intel to design and develop Thunderbolt, and today our customers enjoy the speed and flexibility it brings to every Mac. We remain committed to the future of Thunderbolt and will support it in Macs with Apple silicon,\u201d commented an Apple spokesperson, in a statement to The Verge.\nWhile there was some concern that Apple might be losing support for Thunderbolt on its upcoming Macs, the fact that Apple is sticking with the standard makes a lot of sense, given that it had helped develop the original Thunderbolt standard in collaboration with Intel.\n\u201cWe remain committed to the future of Thunderbolt and will support it in Macs with Apple silicon.\u201d\nDespite that collaboration, though, Apple has yet to offer Thunderbolt support on any products outside of Intel-powered Macs \u2014 Apple\u2019s ARM-based iPad Pro, in particular, stands out as featuring a regular USB-C port, not a Thunderbolt 3 connector. Apple\u2019s ARM-based Developer Transition Kit also only features standard USB-C ports.\nThe news comes as Intel detailed its upcoming Thunderbolt 4 standard, which will be based on the USB4 spec standard and which uses the same USB-C connector that Thunderbolt 3 already does today. Both Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 offer more guaranteed features (like the ability to power external monitors, or charge laptops) compared to the standard USB 3 and USB4 standards that they\u2019re built off of, and offer a consistency that regular USB-C standards can often be sorely lacking in.\nThunderbolt 4, in particular, offers the same 40 Gbps speeds that Thunderbolt 3 had offered, but adds even stricter hardware requirements for manufacturers: devices will have to be able to support either two 4K displays or one 8K display, and allow for PCIe data transfer speeds of up to 32 Gbps \u2014 which should be a boon for external storage and external GPUs.",

        "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook has agreed to testify as part of a US House Judiciary Committee antitrust probe later this month. Cook is the latest of the four largest tech companies CEOs to agree to testify during the antitrust hearing, following Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, and Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos.\nKara Swisher first reported the news on Twitter, following an interview with House antitrust panel chairman Representative David Cicilline (D-RI). Other details on the specifics of this session are still unclear, other than that it will take place later this month.\nThe goal of the bipartisan congressional probe is to find out whether tech giants capitalize on their size to give themselves an unfair advantage over smaller companies, and whether these decisions affect consumers. In Apple\u2019s case, the concerns generally center on the cut the company takes from App Store sales and in-app payments and subscriptions.\nCicilline has been one of the most vocal critics of big technology companies over the last several years. For example, Cicilline last year explained that he\u2019s concerned that Apple could be using its first stance on protecting user privacy \u201cas a shield for competitive behavior. Furthermore, just a few weeks ago, Cicilline said in an interview that the market power Apple holds has become nothing short of \u201chighway robbery.\u201d\nAs we reported just last month, Cook was facing increasing pressure to testify at the hearing, especially given that Amazon, Facebook, and Google leadership had all agreed to face questions. In the past, Apple representatives, such as chief compliance officer Kyle Andeer, have testified during congressional hearings on anti-competitive concerns.\nWe should learn more about Cook\u2019s plans to testify at the hearing soon. Notably, this news comes just a week after a report indicated that an Apple antitrust probe in the United States in imminent and that two new antitrust cases into Apple started in Europe.",

It also operates a separate plant in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, where it makes smartphones for China's Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK, among others.\nFoxconn Chairman Liu Young-way last month said it would ramp up its investment in India, without giving details.\nSTATUS SYMBOL\nApple accounts for about 1% of smartphone sales in India, the world\u2019s second-biggest smartphone market, where its pricey iPhones are often seen as a status symbol.\nBuilding more phones in India will also help Apple save on import taxes that further push up its prices.\nApple assembles a few models through Taiwan's Wistron Corp 3231.TW in the southern tech hub of Bengaluru. Wistron is also set to open a new plant, where it plans to make more Apple devices, Reuters previously reported.\n\u201cWith India\u2019s labour cheaper compared with China, and the gradual expansion of its supplier base here, Apple will be able to use the country as an export hub,\u201d Neil Shah of Hong Kong-based tech researcher Counterpoint said.\nIndia is also working to boost electronics manufacturing by firms such as Foxconn and last month launched a $6.65 billion plan, offering five global smartphone makers incentives to establish or expand domestic production.\nHaving Apple widen its local presence is likely to be a boost for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s flagship \u201cMake In India\u201d drive, aimed at creating new jobs.\nSouth Korea's Samsung 005930.KS has already said it will make smartphones for export from its plant outside New Delhi.",

        "body": "Apple is allocating more than $400 million toward affordable housing projects and homeowner assistance programs in California this year, marking a major milestone in the company\u2019s multiyear $2.5 billion commitment to combat the housing crisis in the state. The funding will support thousands of Californians with first-time homebuyer assistance or new affordable housing units.\nProjects launching this year include the first affordable housing developments funded in partnership with Housing Trust Silicon Valley, which will create more than 250 new units of affordable housing across the Bay Area, as well as a mortgage and down payment assistance fund and an affordable housing investment support program, both created in conjunction with the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA). Apple is also supporting additional construction of affordable housing units through its partnership with Destination: Home, which supports Silicon Valley\u2019s most vulnerable populations.\n\u201cAt a time when so many members of our community are facing unprecedented challenges, we believe it\u2019s critical to make sure that their hopes for the future are supported through tangible programs and results,\u201d said Kristina Raspe, Apple\u2019s vice president for Global Real Estate and Facilities. \u201cAs cities and states have been forced to pause many of their long-term affordable housing investments amidst the current public health crisis, Apple is proud to continue moving forward with our comprehensive plan to combat the housing crisis in California.\u201d",

        "title": "The next MacBook may be Apple's cheapest laptop in years",
        "body": "Apple\u2019s first ARM-powered MacBook might be its cheapest laptop yet, according to a new leak.\nA rumor from Apple leaker iHacktu Pro (the tweet has since been deleted) and spotted by Apple Insider, claims Apple will debut a 12-inch MacBook powered by Apple Silicon at a special event on October 27, just weeks after it shows off the iPhone 12. While we've heard talk that the ARM-based device, which will allegedly pack a 5nm 12-core CPU, will be cheaper than Intel-based MacBooks, a new rumor claims it could be the cheapest MacBook yet.\nThen, according to another leaker, @komiya_kj, Apple\u2019s 12-inch MacBook will feature a starting price of just $799 (around \u00a3617, AU$1,115), making it $200 cheaper than the current entry-level MacBook Air.\nARM MacBook$799~MacBook Pro 13\u201d$1099~(*idk about the exact price) https://t.co/aypv0pZhGBJuly 25, 2020 See more\nThe tipster also claims that Apple will release a MacBook Pro 13 running on its new ARM chipsets. The laptop, which will reportedly feature a Touch Bar and a cooling fan, will apparently cost around $1,099 (\u00a3848, AU$1,535).\nCurrently, Apple\u2019s cheapest 13-inch MacBook Pro model \u2013 which comes powered by an 8th-generation Intel Core i5 processor - is priced at $1,299.\nAlthough they look like cheaper than Intel-powered MacBooks, Apple\u2019s ARM-based laptops look set to come out on top in the performance stakes.\nApple\u2019s A12Z-powered Developer Transition Kit recently made an appearance on Geekbench 5, where the ARM machine supposedly achieved a score of around 800 on the single-core test, and around 2600 on multi-core, all while running through the Rosetta 2 emulation layer.\nWhile we\u2019re still yet to see the final performance of Apple\u2019s ARM-based CPUs, these leaked scores are significant\u2019y higher than those racked up by the ARM-based Surface Pro X, which uses the SQ1 chip co-developed by Microsoft and Qualcomm.",

        "title": "Apple wins legal battle against EU order to recover $15 billion in Ireland tax case - 9to5Mac",
        "body": "In 2016, Apple was ordered to pay 13 billion euros to Ireland as repayment for back taxes at a rate that the EU deemed was illegal. Both Apple and Ireland appealed the judgment.\nFour years on, the first round of legal battles have come to a conclusion today: the EU court rejected the ruling which essentially means Ireland and Apple won. However, the EU commission will almost certainly appeal. A final decision on a corporate judgment of this scale will take many, many, years to resolve.\nThe European Union order was based on the premise that Apple\u2019s low tax rate deal with Ireland was \u2018selective\u2019 and not offered to other companies, giving Apple an unfair advantage.\nToday\u2019s ruling said that the commission had failed to show that Apple had been granted an economic advantage. Remember, this case is about back-taxes and the low tax rate deal between Apple and Ireland was agreed more than twenty years ago, when Apple was a much smaller company.\nWhilst Apple will be happy with the victory, Ireland faces political contention. In the midst of economic recession, critics of the government in Ireland believe the country should be wanting the tax windfall, which would give a sharp boost to the country\u2019s revenue.\nApple and other big tech firms have been widely criticized for using complicated business structures to achieve very low tax rates in certain regions. For instance, almost all of Apple\u2019s European operations funnel through Ireland. This means that Apple pays almost no tax in individual European countries, like the UK. Apple\u2019s worldwide effective tax rate is around 20%.\nThere are ongoing conversations between countries and governments as to how to redistribute the tax, so multinational corporations like Apple pay roughly equal proportions of tax in every country where they operate.",

        "title": "Universal inks deal that will bring new movies to iTunes just 17 days after theatrical debut",
        "body": "Universal Pictures has signed a new deal with AMC Entertainment to reduce what is called \u201ctheatrical window,\u201d which is the time it takes for a movie screened in theaters to be released on digital platforms. This will allow new blockbusters to be available on iTunes and the Apple TV app in just 17 days after its premiere in theaters.\nThe current \u201ctheatrical window\u201d determines that films made by Universal screened in AMC theaters can only be released for online rental after 75 days, which is more than two months. With this recent change, Universal will be able to bring its new movies to digital platforms in less than three weeks.\nAs pointed out by the Wall Street Journal, AMC had previously threatened not to screen any Universal movie in its theaters after the studio released \u201cTrolls World Tour\u201d directly online. However, with most theaters closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing new movies online as soon as possible has become inevitable.\nWhile a standard movie rental costs around $5, Universal is charging $20 to rent their new movies online. This may not sound advantageous to some people, but surely there\u2019s a group of people who will be happy to pay $20 to watch a new movie at home with the whole family.\nEven if this decision is related to the current world situation, it\u2019s likely that the relationship between studios and theaters will permanently change. Universal says the company will \u201ccontinue experimenting with such a strategy.\u201d\nWould you be willing to pay to watch a new movie online instead of going to a movie theater, even after the pandemic? Let us know in the comments below.",
