        "body": "Printed passports may become a thing of the past\nAppleInsider may earn an affiliate commission on purchases made through links on our site.\nThe next step in Apple's goal of making the iPhone the sole thing anyone has to carry, continues with the device being able to securely replace passports, driver's licenses, and other physical forms of identification.\nApple most recently announced a plan to rid the world of car keys, but the iPhone has already made us forget what it's like to carry diaries, cameras, pens, and even mirrors. Now the company is focusing on getting rid of passports \u2014 plus library cards, ski passes, and ID cards in general.\nA series of slightly different patent applications, all entitled \"Providing Verified Claims of User Identity,\" detail methods by which a user's ID can be recorded or transmitted \u2014 and confirmed. Apple does not use the word iPhone once, but instead refers hundreds of times to devices that could be any piece of technology.\n\"A device implementing a system for using a verified claim of identity includes at least one processor configured to receive a verified claim including information to identify a user of a device,\" says one such application, \"the verified claim being signed by a server based on verification of the information by an identity verification provider separate from the server, the verified claim being specific to the device.\"\nUnder this proposal, a device such as an iPhone could securely transmit some form of ID. If the owner of the device is already verified, say by the biometric sensors in Apple Watch, that verifies the ID being sent.\nWhile Apple's application chiefly refers to passports, it's intended that one system be used for many things. \"[This] allows a user to obtain a verified claim of identity that serves as a digital identity for the user, that includes information for identifying the user (e.g., information that was provided by the user and verified by one or more systems), and that can be re-used across different service providers,\" says the application.\nThe five borderline-identical patent applications discuss features such as the user's choice to opt-in to providing ID, and technical details of how the data can be securely transmitted. All five are credited to the same six inventors, including Christopher Sharp and Gianpaolo Fasoli, both of whom have prior related patents such as \"Data verification via independent processors of a device.\"\nThat, Sharp's other patent regarding \"Methods and apparatus for user authentication and human intent verification in mobile devices,\" and these five are far from Apple's first research into iPhone as ID.\nDetail from the patent showing that ID may be securely transmitted and received by every type of Apple device\nPreviously, Apple has worked on secure ways of presenting government ID, and it has worked with both German and UK governments to help local identification projects.\nApple's vice president of internet services and Apple Pay, has publicly said that the company wants to provide ID, but also that it's difficult.\n\"Identity, to be legal, it has to be government, it has to be authenticated by the government,\" she said in 2019. \"We see, across the globe, many countries starting to use mobile to add a passport.",

        "body": "New Delhi: The Chinese government is forcing thousands of its Uyghur Muslim citizens to work as \u201cforced labour\u201d in hundreds of factories across Chinese cities, according to a report published by an Australian think tank in March this year.\nThe report released by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) titled \u201cUyghurs for Sale\u201d stated that big, well-known global companies in the field of clothing, technology and automotive sectors like Abercrombie & Fitch, Amazon, GAP, H&M, Nike, Jack & Jones, Sharp, Siemens, Skechers, ASUS, Apple, Samsung, Huawei, BMW, Volkswagen, Sony, Polo Ralph Lauren, Puma, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Vivo, among others, are using Uyghur Muslims as \u201cforced labour\u201d in their factories in China.\nAccording to the report, these minority labour forces in China are being supplied in a systematic way under the revived and exploitative government-led labour transfer scheme to Chinese factories outside the Xinjiang province in China where this community of Muslims live.\n\u201cThe ASPI has identified 27 factories in nine Chinese provinces that are using Uyghur labour transferred from Xinjiang since 2017. Those factories claim to be part of the supply chain of 83 well-known global brands. Between 2017 and 2019, we estimate that at least 80,000 Uyghurs were transferred out of Xinjiang and assigned to factories through labour transfer programmes under a Central government policy known as \u2018Xinjiang Aid\u2019,\u201d the report said.\nThe factories in which these Uyghur Muslims are made to work form a major chunk of the supply chain of these big brands. For example, in January 2020, around 600 ethnic minority workers from Xinjiang were employed at Qingdao Taekwang Shoes Co. Ltd, which makes shoes for the American company Nike. The workforce in this factory are mostly Uyghur women from Hotan and Kashgar towns in China, which are remote parts of southern Xinjiang that the Chinese government has described as \u201cbackward\u201d and \u201cdisturbed by religious extremism\u201d.\nThe report also mentions that it had investigated into the Haoyuanpeng Clothing Manufacturing Co. Ltd, which has a strategic partnership with global companies like the Italian-South Korean fashion label Fila, German sportswear companies Adidas and Puma and Nike for manufacturing clothes and found that it was part of the \u201cXinjiang Aid\u201d and had been receiving \u201cforced labour\u201d.\nGlobal phone leader Apple\u2019s selfie camera manufacturer O-Film Technology Co. Ltd in Guangzhou, China, is also a part of the \u201cXinjiang Aid\u201d and receives multiple workforces in terms of Uyghur Muslims, the report said. The company also claims on its website to manufacture camera modules and touchscreen components for a number of other well-known companies including Huawei, Lenovo and Samsung.\nA local government document accessed by the ASPI researchers from September 2019 said that 560 Xinjiang labourers were transferred to work in factories in central Henan province, including Foxconn Technology\u2019s Zhengzhou facility. Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, is the biggest contract electronics manufacturer in the world, making devices for Apple, Dell and Sony, among others. The Zhengzhou facility reportedly makes half of the world\u2019s iPhones and is the reason why Zhengzhou city is dubbed as \u201ciPhone city\u201d.\nA September 2019 report by New York-based China Labour Watch said contract workers at Foxconn\u2019s Zhengzhou factory, who include Uyghur workers, had put in at least 100 overtime hours a month. Over the past decade, Foxconn has been marred by allegations of worker exploitation and even suicides, including recently at its Zhengzhou facility. The company has also actively participated in the \u201cXinjiang Aid\u201d scheme.\nThe ASPI report claims that this is a \u201cstate-sponsored\u201d programme where the Uyghurs who are brought in as labour force have no option but to continue with their given assignment as escape route is not easy.\n\u201cThe workers in these factories are brought and kept in dormitories after they finish their \u2018re-education\u2019 in the camps. In their work place, they lead a harsh and segregated life. They are forbidden to practice religion and are required to compulsorily take Mandarin lessons. Most strikingly, local governments and private brokers are paid a price per head by the Xinjiang provincial government to organise the labour assignments,\u201d the report said.\nThe report also brings to light how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) cadres surveil the workers\u2019 families who are left back in the Xinjiang province as a caution to the workers that if they try to flee or are found to be indulging in misconduct in the factory, their families could face consequences.\nThe report also quoted a religious and human rights NGO, Bitter Winter, where a Uyghur worker said, \u201cWe were all former \u2018re-education camp\u2019 detainees and were threatened with further detention if they disobeyed the government\u2019s work assignments. The police regularly search our dormitories and check our phones for any religious content. If a Quran is found, the owner will be sent back to the \u2018re-education camp\u2019 for 3-5 years.\u201d\nThe United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslim Uyghurs have been detained in the camps of Xinjiang over the years for indoctrination and to induct them into the CCP style of living and all this in the name of providing vocational training and removing terrorism.",

Apple has not said when iOS 14 will launch, but it's expected to roll out this year.\n\"We're still trying to understand what these changes will look like and how they will impact us and the rest of the industry, but at the very least, it's going to make it harder for app developers and others to grow using ads on Facebook and elsewhere,\" Wehner said.\nUntil now, advertisers could use a device ID number called the IDFA to better target ads and estimate their effectiveness.

        "body": "Outline of the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act\nSenators Graham, Blackburn, and Cotton call the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act (press release): \"a bill to bolster national security interests and better protect communities across the country by ending the use of \u201cwarrant-proof\u201d encrypted technology by terrorists and other bad actors to conceal illicit behavior\".\nThey justify the proposed bill with the threat from terrorists and pedophiles: \"Tech companies\u2019 increasing reliance on encryption has turned their platforms into a new, lawless playground of criminal activity. Criminals from child predators to terrorists are taking full advantage\", says Cotton. He wants to \"end the Wild West of crime on the Internet\".\nInstead, Cotton wants to open the Wild West for law enforcement and the authorities. Once surveillance laws such as an encryption backdoor for the \"good guys\" is available, it's just a matter of time until the \"good guys\" turn bad or abuse their power. History has taught us that often enough so we should be able to understand the threat of an Orwellian-like surveillance by the government. In Germany alone, we had two oppressive governments in the last one hundred years that taught us why government surveillance is very dangerous: the GDR and Nazi Germany.\nPublic opinion objects to an encryption backdoor\nBy stressing the fact that tech companies must decrypt sensitive information only after a court issues a warrant, the three Senators believe they can swing the public opinion in favor of this encryption backdoor law.\nHowever, the backbone of the internet relies on unbreakable encryption. We need it for banking, for storing sensitive documents, for having a private communication online. Of course, the Senators argue that the backdoor they are demanding would be only available to the 'good guys' only. However, cryptography experts have already explored in detail if and how an encryption backdoor could be realized.\nThe conclusion has always been the same: While implementing a backdoor is easy, limiting its access to the 'good guys' only is impossible.\nHow would such a backdoor work?\nTo comply with decryption orders such as demanded by the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act, online services would need to have central access to all encrypted data, possibly with a general decryption key. When being presented with a court order, they would have to decrypt the data of this particular user - leaving the data of all other users untouched.\nThis process is done by employees, by people. Consequently, one can imagine how hard - if not impossible - it would be to secure the general key from abuse and mistakes. Particularly when considering the high value that such a general key would have to malicious attackers, state actors (also from abroad), and others.\nWith the constantly rising number of breaches, shown by this data breach report, one can imagine that it would not take long before some malicious actor on the internet got access to this general key, rendering all encryption for all users futile.\nHow devastating this would be, becomes obvious when looking at one of the most severe data breaches of 2020: The so-called BlueLeaks breach exposed files from hundreds of US police departments, including personal information of suspects and convicted criminals alike.\nStop the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act\nJust like the EARN IT bill, we must stop the proposed Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act. Please take action and stop this attack on encryption of US companies. Here is how.",

        "title": "Nearly 70% of iOS users will deny tracking permissions if they are requested in-app to opt-in",
        "body": "Nearly 70% of iOS and Android users will deny tracking permissions if they are requested in-app to opt-in | In App monetization In Market Research | By By Andreas Vourkos\nLast week, at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple announced some new privacy and security features for iOS. With the new changes publishers will be required to provide information about their app\u2019s data collection practices and also explicitly ask their users for their permission to track them, across apps and websites owned by other companies.This is a major change for the industry, since so far, users were required to opt-out if they wanted from sharing their data and identifiers with third party networks. Now, with the new changes, users will have to explicitly opt-in within their apps to allow tracking or sharing of their data.\nThe upcoming changes will make it harder for advertisers and marketers to track and target users across apps, creating a level of uncertainty on how that industry will work from now on. The changes are expected to improve transparency on users\u2019 privacy, but they will also have an impact on the current app\u2019s economy and how apps monetize. Some of the most important players in that space such as ad networks and attribution networks will be immediately affected.\nThe big question is how will iOS users react to the latest changes once the new privacy features start rolling out later this year?\nVery few believe that users will opt in to share their data with third parties or allow tracking of them, especially with the way that Apple proposes to communicate that to the users.\nAs the mobile apps landscape becomes more unified on how privacy is handled, those changes could also come to Android soon. Is there any differentiation on how Android users would react in similar changes around privacy?\nPollfish ran two studies of 1000 respondents each in the US, one on iOS and one on Android to measure how iOS and Android users would react to the upcoming privacy changes.\n68.3% of iOS and 67.5% of Android users will likely deny tracking permissions if they are requested in-app to opt-in.\nThere is an active conversation in the industry, if app owners would be allowed to incentivize users with some sort of virtual goods, in exchange for giving permission to track them. In the same surveys, both iOS and Android users were asked what they would do in that scenario and it seems that around 15% of the users (14.2% of iOS and 14.9% of Android users) would change their mind.\n38.6% of iOS and 38.1% of Android users would potentially allow themselves to be tracked, if there was some virtual reward in exchange.\nIn the current permission popup suggested by Apple, the app owners can add a small amount of text in the description, to explain the reasoning behind requesting the tracking permission. In the surveys, users were asked if they would change their preference, if they were to receive a proper explanation from the app owners, prior or within the popup. Around 22% of the users (20.4% of iOS and 24% of Android users) would potentially change their preference.\n44.8% of iOS and 47.2% of Android users would potentially allow themselves to be tracked, if app owners were to give them proper reasoning in advance.\nFrom respondents participating in the surveys, 52.5% on iOS did not know that they could Limit Ad Tracking at the moment, in their iPhone\u2019s settings area. Of those, 42.43% have the option enabled and 56.6% of them stated that they have limited tracking enabled due to privacy concerns.\nIn a similar question to Android users, 42.6% were not aware of the option to Opt out from interest based ads and from those that knew that setting, 51.27% have already opted out. 46.41% stated that they opted out due to privacy concerns.\nTo conclude, upcoming privacy changes in iOS are about to make a big impact on how apps monetize their audience and how advertising and attribution networks work. The study showed that a large proportion of the users will not allow themselves to be tracked, a crucial step in effectively running and attributing ad campaigns in the apps space at the moment. Similar findings were also revealed with Android users. Privacy seems to be a key concern among users in the mobile space and by providing them with more transparency and choices, seems to change the current landscape dramatically.",

Traditionally these queries are not encrypted and sent in clear text which has allowed third parties and even Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to snoop on the websites users visit online.\nBy using DoH or DoT, web browsers and apps can make DNS queries and receive DNS responses in an encrypted format and this helps prevent unwanted tracking online.\nEncrypted DNS\nApple will add new functions and features to its app development frameworks to allow developers to either create new apps or update their existing apps to use either DoH or DoT to encrypt DNS traffic.\nAccording to Apple software engineer Tommy Pauly who gave the presentation, developers can create apps to apply DoH or DoT settings to the entire operation system, to individual apps or to an app's selected network requests.\nDevelopers will also be able to write \u201crules\u201d to enable support for encrypted DNS communications only in certain situations or contexts. For example, encrypted DNS could be turned on when a user leaves their corporate network and switches to mobile data while away from the office or traveling.\nIf for some reason a network provider decides to block encrypted DNS communications on their network, Apple is planning to warn users with a message that explains that the names of websites and other servers their device accesses on that network could be monitored and recorded.\nThe addition of encrypted DNS is great news for iPhone, iPad and Mac users though Apple is a bit late to the party as Mozilla, Google and Microsoft already support encrypted DNS communications in their respective software.\nAlso check out our complete list of the best antivirus software\nVia ZDNet (opens in new tab)",

        "title": "Apple Makes a Major Privacy Move by Allowing Users to Disable Ad Tracking and Have Greater Insight Into App Permissions",
        "body": "The headline announcement from Apple\u2019s 2020 Worldwide Developers Conference was that users would be getting an unprecedented level of control over personal privacy, enough that it might entirely upend mobile marketing on iOS. The headline item was that users would be able to selectively disable ad tracking by making their unique ID invisible to certain apps, but a suite of other enhanced privacy features was introduced: more detailed breakdowns of app permissions, new indicator lights and new Safari screening features among them.\nThe changes to Apple ads will be coming with the new iOS 14 operating system, which is expected to be released sometime in September.\nApple puts an (optional) end to ad tracking in individual apps\nThe biggest news is that Apple device users will now be able to opt out of Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) tracking on an app-by-app basis. As the name indicates, this unique device ID is provided to marketers primarily for targeted advertising purposes. While it is supposed to be randomized and not tied to any personally identifying information, developers would sometimes overstep intended boundaries with it when using it for traffic analytics purposes.\nThe system will be opt-in at the user end, but will proactively display a warning before running each new app indicating that it wants to track users \u201cacross other apps and websites.\u201d A screenshot of the warning is phrased in such a way that it looks like users will overwhelmingly opt in.\nThe move follows over a year of campaigning by various groups, with Mozilla playing a key role. Mozilla ran a petition for monthly rotation of IDFAs in 2019 that gathered 20,000 signatures, and sponsored a poll late in the year that indicated half of all iPhone users did not know that the identification number existed or that it was used to track users.\nThe marketing industry is bracing for a significant hit to the mobile advertising business, assuming that most users will choose to opt out of ad tracking when presented with this warning notification. There is an existing ability to opt out of some IDFA ad tracking in iOS, but it requires users to go through the settings menu and does not allow them to pick and choose access for individual apps. A marketing study from March indicates that only about 30% of iOS users have enabled this \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d feature.\nOther iOS 14 privacy improvements\nChanges are also coming to Apple\u2019s location tracking settings in iOS, which in turn will likely have an impact on any kind of ad tracking (whether IDFA or third-party systems). Users will now be able to limit apps to accessing approximate data rather than a precise location, allowing for the use of location-dependent features while adding a substantial layer of privacy protection.\nApp permission lists are now also going to be divided into separate categories, with one unique list designed to highlight data that is specifically used to track users. And Safari will have a new \u201cprivacy report\u201d button located near the URL bar, which will display all third-party trackers on a given website and allow users to selectively disable them. This may strike an additional blow to ad tracking as it gives users greater and more convenient visibility into third-party advertising campaigns that do not rely on the IDFA.\nFocusing on hardware\nThe move to effectively dump ad tracking from Apple devices signals a doubling down on the company\u2019s privacy-first branding and strategy of focusing on high-priced hardware sales to a more affluent consumer base willing to stay within the company\u2019s curated and secure \u201cwalled garden\u201d of software. It\u2019s also possible that the company sees this as a simpler way to navigate a global regulatory landscape that is increasingly favoring strict privacy protections for end users.\nThe move is not necessarily a total net positive for users of iOS devices, however, as app developers are not likely to simply roll over and let their ad networks die. Instead, it is quite likely they will switch to other schemes that are less convenient and potentially more intrusive for the end user. For example, more apps might require users to create accounts with the developer and log in before using. Some free apps may opt to simply switch to a paid model rather than attempt to serve ads.\nNew #iOS 14 allows #Apple users to selectively disable ad tracking by making their unique IDs invisible to apps. #privacy #respectdata\nClick to Tweet\nThere is some chance that Google will have Android follow suit at some point in the near future, as the search giant has been known to copy Apple\u2019s user data privacy moves (such as ending support for third-party cookies in Chrome) albeit with a substantial amount of lag time. This move is less certain, however, as Google is much more dependent on marketing and ad tracking revenue than Apple is.",

        "title": "You can upgrade an Apple iPod Classic with an M.2 SSD fit for a PC",
        "body": "Audio player loading\u2026\nThe Apple iPod Classic is a piece of technology that will go down in history as best in class. There's no PC/Mac rivalry here, these are just the facts, and I still use mine on long journeys to this day. But even MP3 royalty grows old, and the iPod's spinning platter HDD is certainly showing its age in an era of solid state. But what if you could swap it out for something a little faster?\nThe iPod Classic was discontinued way back in 2014, and I'd take a guess and say most still alive and kicking are quite a bit older than that, too. That's quite a long time for a HDD to be operating for, and it would usually be a death sentence for most batteries, too (somehow my iPod, despite a multi-year sabbatical from operation, still has a multi-day battery).\nBut rather than accept your device is teetering on death, how about going about modding it for yourself? That very upgrade is possible thanks to a bespoke modding part from iFlash: the iFlash-Sata v10 (opens in new tab). It's built to accommodate one M.2 SATA SSD (note: SATA, not NVMe) at a size of 2242 (a little shy of the default drive size of 2280).\nThat's exactly the kit used by YouTube channel DankPods (opens in new tab), who set about this very mod in their latest video titled 'PC SSDs in an iPod Classic (opens in new tab)'. Guess what they go about modding into the iPod Classic? That's right, an M.2 SSD fit for a desktop machine. And it works a treat, too.\nYour next upgrade (Image credit: Future) Best CPU for gaming (opens in new tab): the top chips from Intel and AMD\nBest graphics card (opens in new tab): your perfect pixel-pusher awaits\nBest SSD for gaming (opens in new tab): get into the game ahead of the rest\nThat is, if you ignore that the drive (and most of the buttons, in fact) are hanging off the iPod being modded. That's largely to down to user error on DankPod's part, who has a history of jury-rigging things together, and who I hope doesn't mind if I say made a rather simple, but debilitating, error this time around: buying a 2280 SSD that is near-enough the length of an iPod by itself.\nAt least they tread that ground so that you know what not to do. Granted, there are a few other drawbacks, too. For one, the famed lifespan of the iPod Classic will take a rather dramatic turn when using an M.2 SSD. Also it may need a little tinkering every so often to sync up to your machine. Oh, and it also does get quite hot.\nPerhaps it's best to follow DankPod's expert advice and settle for the less speedy but far more convenient SD card iFlash mod board instead.",

        "title": "Intel's 7nm is Broken, Company Announces Delay Until 2022, 2023",
        "body": "(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\nIntel announced today in its Q2 2020 earnings release that it has now delayed the rollout of its 7nm CPUs by six months relative to its previously-planned release date, undoubtedly resulting in wide-ranging delays to the company's roadmaps that could cause the company to lose ranks in our CPU Benchmark Hierarchy. Intel's press release also says that yields for its 7nm process are now twelve months behind the company's internal targets, meaning the company isn't currently on track to produce its 7nm process in an economically viable way. The company now says its 7nm CPUs will not debut on the market until late 2022 or early 2023.\nHere's the snippet from Intel's press release:\n\"The company's 7nm-based CPU product timing is shifting approximately six months relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of Intel's 7nm process, which based on recent data, is now trending approximately twelve months behind the company's internal target.\"\nOn the earnings call, Intel CEO Bob Swan said the company had identified a \"defect mode\" in its 7nm process that caused yield degradation issues. As a result, Intel has invested in \"contingency plans,\" which Swan later defined as including using third-party foundries. The company will also use external third-party foundries for its forthcoming 7nm Ponte Vecchio GPUs, the company's first graphics chips. Ponte Vecchio comes as a chiplet-based design, and Swan clarified that production for some of the chiplets (tiles) will be outsourced to third parties. Swan noted the GPUs will come in late 2021 or early 2022, portending a delay beyond the original schedule for a 2021 launch in the exascale Aurora supercomputer.\nIntel's first 7nm server CPUs (Granite Rapids) will arrive in 2023, which is later than listed in earlier roadmaps that projected a launch in 2022. That timeline is concerning in the face of AMD's continued execution with its EPYC data center chips \u2013 AMD's roadmaps outline its 5nm Genoa processors coming to market before the end of 2022. Swan also said that Intel's first 7nm processors will debut for the client market, meaning chips targeting either desktop PCs or laptops. Intel's first 10nm desktop CPUs, Alder Lake, will arrive in the second half of 2021.\nFor perspective, rival foundry TSMC plans to be on the 3nm node in the same time frame as Intel's new schedule for 7nm. Intel clearly isn't pleased with its execution on the 7nm node, as an embattled Swan remarked that \"And we feel pretty good about where we are, though we\u2019re not happy. I\u2019m not pleased with our 7nm process performance\" at the end of the call after a bruising question and answer session with analysts. Swan also said \"we have root-caused the [7nm] issue and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks,\" and that the company would provide further updates at an upcoming Architecture Day.\nSwan said the company had a built-in buffer in its roadmap to account for process node delays. That accomodation comes as a result of hard-learned lessons from the company's incessant 10nm delays. Intel says it will use its advanced packaging technologies, which allow it to mix and match components produced from external sources with its own chips, to help reconcile the six month delay to its 7nm processors with the year-long delay to its internal 7nm yield projections. Swan also noted that Intel could use third-party foundries for entire chip designs. In the past, Intel stated that it would also enable newer architectures to be portable to older nodes, so it's plausible that Intel could resort to back-porting some architectures as part of its contingency plan.\nThe 7nm delay reflects yet another setback as Intel still struggles to overcome the multi-year yield issues it has encountered with its 10nm process. Those delays have allowed its competitors, like AMD, to wrest the process node leadership position from Intel for the first time in the company's history. That's triggered a price war in the market as Intel fights a true x86 competitor with a better node, not to mention Amazon's new Graviton 2 ARM chips based on TSMC's 7nm node. Apple also recently announced that it is transitioning from Intel's chips to its own ARM-based 7nm silicon. The 7nm delay also exacerbates the recent news that rock star chip architect Jim Keller, who was a key part of a team effort to revitalize the company's roadmaps, has left the company.\n(Image credit: Intel)\nIntel CFO George Davis has previously indicated that the company's process tech would lag its its competitors until 7nm arrived in 2021, and that the company would regain the lead with its 5nm process at an undefined time:\n\"So we bring a lot of capability to the table for our customers, in addition to the CPU, and we feel like we're starting to see the acceleration on the process side that we have been talking about to get back to parity in the 7nm generation and regain leadership in the 5nm generation.\"\nThat plan to regain a competitive footing has now obviously shifted due to the 7nm delay. Intel had planned to speed the delivery of its 7nm node to offset the underperforming 10nm, which it said would not perform as well as other nodes. At the time, Davis noted that the company was trying to be clear with investors about the impacts of 10nm on the company's gross margins: \"...but the fact is that I wanted to be clear what was happening during the 10nm generation. The fact is, it isn't going to be as strong a node as people would expect from 14nm or what they'll see in 7nm.\"\nIn regards to the 10nm node, Davis commented: \"As we said back at our analyst day in May of 19: Look, this isn't just going to be the best node that Intel has ever had. It's going to be less productive than 14nm, less productive than 22nm, but we're excited about the improvements that we're seeing and we expect to start the 7nm period with a much better profile of performance over that starting at the end of 2021.\"\n\"Also, we were at a time when in order to regain process leadership we had to accelerate the overlap between 10nm, 7nm, and then 7nm and 5nm, so the cost that you're absorbing, starting in particular in 2021, you\u2019ve got this intersection of the performance of 10nm, the investment in 7nm, and were also well into starting the investment in 5nm: All of those elements just combine to impact gross margin.\"\nToday Intel said that it plans to increase its shipments of 10nm chips by 20% over its prior projections, so it appears the company's 10nm plans have shifted out of necessity. Intel's new plan centers on gaining another 'full node' of performance from its current 10nm node, meaning 10nm may have longer legs than the company expected when it announced last year that it would accelerate 7nm production. Intel pulled off a similar feat with its 14nm processors through a series of \"+\" revisions that added incremental performance improvements, so it does have a track record of successful inter-node improvements that could help it remain competitive until it can correct the issues with its 7nm process.\nIntel has also traditionally used third-party fabs, currently to the tune of ~20% of its production, for low-margin, non-CPU products built on trailing-edge nodes. Intel's new plans to more aggressively leverage external fabs could result in it using other fabs for its core logic, like CPUs and GPUs, which the company hasn't done in the past. As Swan noted, that will present challenges in maintaining attractive ASPs for Intel's products, especially given the scale of its production needs. Ultimately, Intel could also face significantly reduced margins if it outsources significant portions of its fabrication of high-margin products, like CPUs, to third parties. Relying upon an outside vendor for leading-edge node production also incurs more risk in terms of supply assurance as Intel could be forced to compete with deep-pocketed rival semiconductor companies, like Apple, Nvidia and AMD, among others, for production capacity.",

We remain committed to the future of Thunderbolt and will support it in Macs with Apple silicon,\u201d commented an Apple spokesperson, in a statement to The Verge.\nWhile there was some concern that Apple might be losing support for Thunderbolt on its upcoming Macs, the fact that Apple is sticking with the standard makes a lot of sense, given that it had helped develop the original Thunderbolt standard in collaboration with Intel.\n\u201cWe remain committed to the future of Thunderbolt and will support it in Macs with Apple silicon.\u201d\nDespite that collaboration, though, Apple has yet to offer Thunderbolt support on any products outside of Intel-powered Macs \u2014 Apple\u2019s ARM-based iPad Pro, in particular, stands out as featuring a regular USB-C port, not a Thunderbolt 3 connector. Apple\u2019s ARM-based Developer Transition Kit also only features standard USB-C ports.\nThe news comes as Intel detailed its upcoming Thunderbolt 4 standard, which will be based on the USB4 spec standard and which uses the same USB-C connector that Thunderbolt 3 already does today. Both Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 offer more guaranteed features (like the ability to power external monitors, or charge laptops) compared to the standard USB 3 and USB4 standards that they\u2019re built off of, and offer a consistency that regular USB-C standards can often be sorely lacking in.\nThunderbolt 4, in particular, offers the same 40 Gbps speeds that Thunderbolt 3 had offered, but adds even stricter hardware requirements for manufacturers: devices will have to be able to support either two 4K displays or one 8K display, and allow for PCIe data transfer speeds of up to 32 Gbps \u2014 which should be a boon for external storage and external GPUs.",

        "title": "Apple wins legal battle against EU order to recover $15 billion in Ireland tax case - 9to5Mac",
        "body": "In 2016, Apple was ordered to pay 13 billion euros to Ireland as repayment for back taxes at a rate that the EU deemed was illegal. Both Apple and Ireland appealed the judgment.\nFour years on, the first round of legal battles have come to a conclusion today: the EU court rejected the ruling which essentially means Ireland and Apple won. However, the EU commission will almost certainly appeal. A final decision on a corporate judgment of this scale will take many, many, years to resolve.\nThe European Union order was based on the premise that Apple\u2019s low tax rate deal with Ireland was \u2018selective\u2019 and not offered to other companies, giving Apple an unfair advantage.\nToday\u2019s ruling said that the commission had failed to show that Apple had been granted an economic advantage. Remember, this case is about back-taxes and the low tax rate deal between Apple and Ireland was agreed more than twenty years ago, when Apple was a much smaller company.\nWhilst Apple will be happy with the victory, Ireland faces political contention. In the midst of economic recession, critics of the government in Ireland believe the country should be wanting the tax windfall, which would give a sharp boost to the country\u2019s revenue.\nApple and other big tech firms have been widely criticized for using complicated business structures to achieve very low tax rates in certain regions. For instance, almost all of Apple\u2019s European operations funnel through Ireland. This means that Apple pays almost no tax in individual European countries, like the UK. Apple\u2019s worldwide effective tax rate is around 20%.\nThere are ongoing conversations between countries and governments as to how to redistribute the tax, so multinational corporations like Apple pay roughly equal proportions of tax in every country where they operate.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
