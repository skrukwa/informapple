        "title": "Unlike Roomba, Apple confirms it won't upload, share or sell your home data from HomePod",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nWith vacuum maker iRobot looking to sell user's house maps to smart home vendors, an AppleInsider reader asked Apple what it planned to do with data collected by the HomePod's room mapping technology. Unsurprisingly, Apple confirmed it has no intention of saving or sharing information about a user's home layout.\nFollowing iRobot's CEO declaring that he was looking to sell collated data from the automatic robot vacuum Roomba, a user reached out to Apple to see what it had in mind on the same topic. The user was concerned because Apple advertises it will use room-mapping technology to automatically tailor the HomePod's audio to fit the space.\nIn an email response to the reader, Apple declared that:\n\"No information is sent to Apple servers until HomePod recognizes the key utterance \"Hey Siri,\" and any information after that point is encrypted and sent via an anonymous Siri ID. For room sensing, all analysis is done locally on the device and is not shared with Apple.\"\nReaching out to Apple for more data regarding the statement and to confirm its authenticity, AppleInsider was told that there was \"nothing at all new here\" and there is no change to the company's privacy page for Siri and hardware. The privacy page states clearly that it does not collect and sell user data gleaned by Siri or other services.\nWhile Apple's privacy policy on Siri is not new, the room sensing technology set to be introduced in the HomePod itself is. Confirmation that Apple has no intention to upload or share the data should help put privacy advocates at ease.\nApple's HomePod uses the microphones to listen not only to the user, but to the audio being played in real-time. The A8 analyzes not only the sound of the audio in the room, but \"time in flight,\" telling the device where each wall or sound-reflecting object is in the room, and adjusts the output accordingly based on this data.\nWhile not quite the same as how a Roomba can map a user's floors and furniture, it's still some general idea of how a person's home is laid out, or how large it is.\nUnlike Apple, which plans to keep any home data stored on the device itself, Roomba collects and stores information on a user's home not only to improve its products, but also with the possibility that it could share and sell it in the future.\nRoomba builder iRobot believes that the data could be of interest to Apple, Amazon, and Google to improve the data sets utilized in home automation software and services, or to suggest a new product to fill a service gap. To boost its bottom line, iRobot has started looking for customers willing to pay for that data.\nAs detailed this week, the 900-series Roomba automated vacuums measure the dimensions of a room, as well as furniture orientation, size of the devices, and where they are located in the room. This is accomplished by simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology.",

        "body": "Apple today announced that it is adding PayPal as a new payment method to the App Store, iTunes Store, iBookstore and Apple Music services. This means Apple users will be able to add PayPal to their Apple ID in order to buy apps, musics, movies, TV shows and more.\nPayPal is a nice alternative to gift cards for users who don\u2019t want to (or can\u2019t) attach credit cards to their account. The option is available now in select countries and will roll out to more customers soon, including the United States \u2026\nUntil now, Apple has only allowed users to buy digital content with either a bank card or gift card credit. The addition of PayPal will no doubt encourage even more users to make purchases using Apple\u2019s services as it rolls out worldwide.\nPayPal can be used to buy pretty much anything that a gift card can. This means you can use PayPal for apps in the App Store, music and TV shows in iTunes, renew your Apple Music subscription and even pay for the iCloud Storage plans.\nTo add PayPal to your store account, click here to open the Account screen for iTunes. Then select \u2018Payment Information\u2019, select PayPal in the Payment Method options and follow the steps to authenticate.\nOnce setup, all future Apple content purchases (apps, music, movies, books and more) will be charged to the designated PayPal account.\nThe PayPal payment method for Apple IDs is launching today in Mexico, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. The company says it will be launching in other regions in the coming weeks, including the United States \u2018soon\u2019.",

        "body": "Apple's stock price has declined around 9 percent from its all-time high of $156.10 in May, but Wall Street analyst Brian White believes the recent sell-off represents \"yet another buying opportunity\" as investors turn their focus to the so-called \"iPhone 8\" rumored to launch this fall.\nWhite believes Apple remains \"among the most underappreciated stocks in the world,\" according to his research note distributed to clients today. A copy of the report was obtained by MacRumors.\nIn our view, Apple's quarterly results will be less important this summer as investors are focused on the iPhone 8 this fall, along with the company's raised capital distribution initiative, depressed valuation and new innovations as showcased at WWDC. We still believe Apple remains among the most underappreciated stocks in the world.\nWhite, an Apple bull, added that the upcoming iPhone cycle is setting up Apple to reach his $202 price target over the next 12 months, which would value the iPhone maker as over a trillion dollar company based on market capitalization. Apple's current market capitalization is around $737 billion.\nSimilar to the bottoming process in Apple during the summer of 2013 that drove a strong rally into the spring of 2015, we believe the bottom in the stock during May 2016 and the upcoming iPhone cycle is setting up Apple to reach our $202.00 price target over the next 12 months.\nIn May, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani also said Apple could reach or exceed a trillion dollar market cap within 12 to 18 months, with a stock price of $192-$195. Like White, Daryanani said the \"iPhone 8\" will be a major catalyst towards Apple's path to a trillion dollar valuation.\nWhite maintains the highest price target for Apple's stock among all institutional analysts. AAPL closed at $142.73 on Thursday.",

        "body": "Apple and Cochlear team up to roll out the first implant made for the iPhone\nApple has teamed up with Australian-based Cochlear to bring iPhone users the first made for iPhone Cochlear implant.\nApproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June, Cochlear\u2019s Nucleus 7 Sound Processor can now stream sound directly from a compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch to the sound processor.\nThe device also allows those with a surgically embedded implant to control and customize the sound from their iPhone.\nThere have been other implants and hearing aids that have used iOS apps to control sound and other features and Nucleus\u2019s own app can be downloaded to do the same. However, Cochlear\u2019s newest processor is controlled by the phone itself and does not require an app download.\nMore than 50 million Americans have experienced some sort of hearing loss due to one reason or another. Apple saw the hearing loss problem and has spent a number of years developing a hearing aid program within the company.\nApple soon developed a protocol the company offered for free for hearing aid and implant manufacturers to use with their devices.\n\u201cWe wanted to see something that could become ubiquitous out in the world,\u201d Apple\u2019s Sarah Herrlinger, senior manager for global accessibility policy and initiatives told TechCrunch. \u201cWe want everybody to use our technology and to say \u2018wow my iPhone is the best piece of technology I\u2019ve ever used before\u2019\u2026with every iteration of our operating system our goal is to add in new accessibility features in order to expand the support that we can give to people all over the world.\u201d\nAccessing the control settings for your Cochlear implant is relatively easy. Those who get the new Nucleus 7 Sound Processor or other made for iPhone hearing aid simply go to their iPhone settings, click on \u201cGeneral\u201d and then click \u201cAccessibility.\u201d As you move down the screen you\u2019ll see a list of different devices you\u2019ll see \u201chearing devices.\u201d Tap on that and then the device should show up the way a Bluetooth device would in Bluetooth settings. The implant will then pair with your iPhone.\nJust like headphones or another Bluetooth-enabled device, as soon as the implant is paired up it can be controlled using the iPhone\u2019s volume controls. So, for example, when a phone call comes in, you can hear that call at the volume settings within your implant.\nThe new Nucleus 7 comes with a longer battery life and is also smaller and 24 percent lighter than its predecessor, the Nucleus 6 Sound Processor, making it ideal for small children with hearing loss as well.\n\u201cThe approval of the Nucleus 7 Sound Processor is a turning point for people with hearing loss, opening the door for them to make phone calls, listen to music in high-quality stereo sound, watch videos and have FaceTime calls streamed directly to their Cochlear implant,\u201d Cochlear CEO Chris Smith said in a statement. \u201cThis new sound processor builds on our long-standing commitment to help more people with hearing loss connect with others and live a full life.\u201d",

        "title": "Steve Jobs and the missing \u201cIntel Inside\u201d sticker",
        "body": "Steve Jobs and the missing \u201cIntel Inside\u201d sticker\nMaybe I have a bad attitude.\nI\u2019d be quite content if I never again heard the Intel \u201cbong\u201d at the end of every PC ad.\nI\u2019d also be terminally depressed if I had to look at a gaudy Intel Inside sticker every time I opened my MacBook.\nI get that Intel Inside is one of the most successful marketing campaigns in business history. It\u2019s just that after 36 years, that logo starts to feel more like a pollutant than an advertising device.\nThankfully, Macs have remained 100% free of Intel branding since Apple adopted its processors way back in 2006.\nWe have Steve Jobs\u2019s sensibilities to thank for this. But how it all happened is a fun little story.\nFirst\u2014a little background for those who might have forgotten.\nAN INSIDE JOB\nThe Intel Inside marketing strategy will be studied in business schools around the world for decades. It represented bold thinking and bold spending.\nIn the early days of PCs, shoppers had no reason to care what kind of processor was inside the machine\u2014but Intel made them care.\nThough it sold products only to business, Intel invested a huge amount of money advertising to consumers.\nBasically, it ran commercials glorifying Intel processors, then paid PC makers to tell consumers they had Intel inside.\nWith nearly nonexistent profit margins, the PC makers eagerly took the cash\u2014which, of course, came with conditions. The Intel Inside badge had to be visible on PCs and in advertising, and the TV and radio ads had to additionally play the annoying Intel bong.\nTo get the payout dangled before them, PC makers had to follow strict rules about the placement of the Intel Inside badge, how long it was visible on TV and even the volume level of the bong.\nThis strategy turned Intel into a global powerhouse.\nSTEVE JOBS PICKS A FIGHT\nNeedless to say, Steve Jobs wasn\u2019t a big Intel fan.\nWhen he returned to Apple in 1997, the company was running on fumes. The more Intel PCs dominated the market\u2014due in no small part to Intel\u2019s marketing\u2014the weaker Apple had become.\nThat\u2019s because, unlike PCs, Macs ran on the PowerPC platform, a processor technology jointly developed by Apple, Motorola and IBM. They weren\u2019t bad processors, but perception is everything\u2014and the perception was that PCs were faster than Macs.\nIn Steve\u2019s first days back, he unleashed Jony Ive and team to revolutionize the home computer. This would be the proof that Apple was back in the innovation business, and restore the company to profitability. Unfortunately, iMac was many months in the future.\nSo\u2014what to do now?\nThe answer was Think different. Apple\u2019s iconic brand campaign not only served as a launchpad for future products, it gave us a more exciting way to present our current products.\nSoon after the debut of Think different, Steve gave us some news that provided some much-needed ammunition.\nApple\u2019s internal testing showed that the newest PowerPC processor was faster than Intel\u2019s fastest chip. With a real competitive advantage to work with, we did what any feisty agency would do: we declared war on Intel.\nSuddenly, it was to our advantage that Intel had become the unifying, driving force in PCs. We didn\u2019t have to attack any PC maker by name\u2014we could take on the entire PC industry simply by attacking Intel.\nWe created a series of ads we would later call the \u201cAnti-Intel Trilogy.\u201d First came Snail, which remains one of my favorite Apple advertising moments.\nThen came Burning Bunny. Intel\u2019s own ad campaign made heavy use of dancing Bunny People\u2014the clean-suited Intel employees who manufactured their processors. So, in our ad, we literally \u201ctoasted\u201d one of the Bunny People. (This became a nice full-page newspaper ad as well, as shown below.)\nThe third ad, titled Steamroller, was our way of visually demonstrating the Mac\u2019s \u201cPentium-crushing power.\u201d\n(Pause for interesting fact: the voice on all three of these commercials was Richard Dreyfuss\u2014who debuted with Apple as the voice of the Crazy Ones launch commercial for Think different. We upgraded to Jeff Goldblum in subsequent ads.)\nTo further tweak Intel, we produced sheets of \u201cSnail Inside\u201d stickers to be given out at various Mac events. Not that we would ever condone people surrupticiously placing these stickers on PCs belonging to friends or being displayed in retail stores.\nNeedless to say, Intel was not amused by any of this. An Intel web page went up, refuting Apple\u2019s numbers with different benchmark results. Lawsuits were threatened.\nSteve dreamed that Intel would take the bait. He imagined images of our Intel snail splashed across the world\u2019s business publications.\nSadly, Intel thought better of it. They chose to grin and bear it. Apple was an irritant, but the Intel empire wasn\u2019t about to collapse.\nDid the Anti-Intel Trilogy convince the masses that Macs were faster than Intel-based PCs? Not exactly. But it did force Macs into the conversation, where they hadn\u2019t been for years. The fact that people were actually debating which platform was fastest was a win for Apple.\nAs Steve said, it\u2019s good to have an enemy. It creates focus and motivates the troops.\nThat said, all wars come to an end. Even bitter enemies can become close friends.\nAPPLE JOINS THE CLUB\nIn 2006, hell officially froze over.\nApple\u2019s attacks upon Intel were now several years in the past. iMac had become the best-selling model in computer history (not just Apple\u2019s history). iPod had revolutionized the way music was discovered, purchased and enjoyed.\nThe era of Apple \u201cfiring on all cylinders\u201d was upon us.\nHowever, despite Apple\u2019s successes, Intel processors remained \u201cthe standard.\u201d And Intel\u2019s vast resources ensured that PowerPC processors would always struggle to keep up.\nWith his eye on the future, Steve Jobs did the unthinkable. He announced that Apple was transitioning to Intel processors.\nTHE JOY OF INTEL\nI was present at The Big Announcement.\nIt was a fun moment for me personally. At that time, I was working inside Apple as a creative consultant, but I had just come off a four-year stint as Intel\u2019s ad agency creative director. Four years in hell, I might add.\nAt the event, fate played an interesting trick. I ended up sitting next to some of my former Intel clients. And wow, had they changed.\nWhen we worked together, they had nothing but disdain for Apple. We could use Macs at the agency, but we were forbidden to flash them inside the mother ship.\nYet here they were, bubbling with enthusiasm, soaking up the ambience. It was as if they had front row seats at a Rolling Stones concert.\nThere was even talk\u2014gasp\u2014that they could now get Macs for themselves.\nThe show itself was classic Apple. Steve made his dramatic announcement, and then invited Intel CEO Paul Ottelini to the stage. Paul appeared wearing the famous Intel Bunny Man suit. It was all laughs, hugs and high-fives.\nAnd what did Ottelini do to greet the crowd? He played our Burning Bunny ad, wearing a big smile throughout.\nHe used this moment to savor the fact that the Apple-Intel relationship had evolved from combat to partnership.\n\u201cINTEL INSIDE\u201d OR NOT\nWhen the event concluded, Steve held court with journalists at the front of the stage as he often did.\nI approached him with my biggest concern: \u201cPlease tell me we won\u2019t have to put the Intel Inside logo on our Macs.\u201d\nWith a big grin, Steve looked me in the eye and said, \u201cTrust me, I made sure that\u2019s in the contract.\u201d\nWhew.\nMonths later, before the first Intel-powered iMacs shipped, Apple\u2019s package design team explored different ways to add the Intel element to the iMac box.\nNone included the Intel Inside badge.\nInstead, they created a new graphic element\u2014an artful photograph of a processor bearing a simple Intel corporate logo.\nAt that time, the iMac box featured the large image of the computer on the front and a column of features on the side (things like included software, built-in iSight camera, etc.)\nOne of designs shared with Steve placed the Intel chip apart from the other features, under the large iMac image.\nSteve hated it.\nHe felt that Intel was an important part of the computer, but no more important than iMac\u2019s other features. He preferred simply adding Intel to the feature list on the side of the box. By executive decree, it would be just one more reason to buy an iMac\u2014never the reason.\nSteve cared too much about the brand to siphon any of it off to Intel.\nCLARIFYING THE MAC ADVANTAGE\nFor PC makers grasping for profit, the Intel Inside program was a godsend. It was a revenue stream in itself.\nWhat of poor Apple, then? Did it get no financial break from Intel because it refused to take part in the Intel marketing machine?\nDoubt it. Steve\u2019s negotiating skills were legendary, and he was well aware that Intel relished the opportunity to become Apple\u2019s partner. We can only imagine the deal he made.\nToday, even though some speculate that Apple will switch to ARM processors, one cannot diminish the importance of Steve\u2019s switch to Intel in 2006.\nHis decision instantly demolished the argument that PCs had a built-in advantage over Macs.\nWith processor parity, Apple could focus 100% on the things that set Macs apart on a more human level: software, design, quality and simplicity.\nAnd Jony Ive was forever spared the nightmare of seeing that Intel Inside super-glued to his Macs.",

        "body": "It was reported earlier this month that Apple was close to striking a deal where it would make a large upfront investment in LG\u2019s OLED production lines in return for output being exclusively devoted to iPhone screens.\nA fresh report today supports this, and claims to have more detailed information on the as-yet-unannounced arrangement \u2026\nKorea Economic Daily (via The Investor) claims that the amount Apple is paying LG is 3 trillion won ($2.7B), which represents the bulk of the $3.5B estimated setup cost for the facility. The deal would help LG kickstart its smaller OLED production while providing Apple with a secure supply.\nSamsung currently dominates smartphone-sized OLED panel production, with a market share of around 95%. The company is seeking to further strengthen its lead by building the world\u2019s largest OLED production plant.\nFor this reason, Samsung is expected to be the sole supplier of OLED screens for the iPhone 8, but Apple will be seeking to diversify suppliers as it reportedly looks to introduce the newer display technology to its entire iPhone range from 2018.\nOLED technology is likely to be a stopgap measure for Apple, with microLED expected to replace it within the next few years. Early reports had claimed that the company might make this switch as earlier as this year following Apple\u2019s acquisition of LuxVue back in 2014.\nApple is believed to be trialling microLED production, with the Apple Watch the likely first product to use it, perhaps from next year.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "body": "Fortune has for the second consecutive year declared Apple the most profitable company in the world, despite coming in 9th overall in the Fortune Global 500. The rankings are based on the most recent financial year for each company.\nFortune is best known for its Fortune 500 ranking of U.S. companies, where Apple this year took the #3 slot. But the company also compiles a global list, and it\u2019s here that Apple came in 9th in the overall rankings but #1 in profitability \u2026\nThe overall rankings are based on revenue, with Walmart taking the top slot.\nThe world\u2019s 500 largest companies generated $27.7 trillion in revenues and $1.5 trillion in profits in 2016. Together, this year\u2019s Fortune Global 500 companies employ 67 million people worldwide and are represented by 34 countries.\nWalmart\u2019s revenue was a little over $485B, while Apple earned its 9th place with $215B.\nBut when it comes to profits, it\u2019s a very different story. There, Walmart is relegated to 17th place, with profits of $13.6B, while Apple took first place with $45.7B.\nAfter more than a decade of solid growth fueled first by the iPod music player and then by the even more popular iPhone, Apple finally appeared to hit a wall, with lackluster sales \u201crelatively speaking\u201d for other products such as the iPad and Apple Watch and a heavy reliance on upgraded phone models. But the most profitable publicly-traded company in the world is investing heavily in software and its efforts in new areas of opportunity, including automobiles, remain in development (and under wraps).\nApple retained its position despite its profits falling 14.4% year-on-year. It also topped Fortune\u2019s list of the world\u2019s most admired companies.\nApple is the largest company in the world by market cap, and has long been predicted to be the first company to be worth a trillion dollars (though not everyone agrees).\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Apple aims to get an iPad in the hands of every hospital patient",
        "body": "Apple has made great strides in health in the last few years, and if it gets its way, there will be an iPad in the hands of every hospital patient.\nIt\u2019s already started with a smattering of hospitals around the U.S., including Jacobs Medical Center at UC San Diego, MetroSouth Medical Center in Chicago and, about a year ago, at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.\nEarlier this week, I went down to L.A. to take a tour of Cedars-Sinai\u2018s pilot program allowing patients direct access to their vitals, care team and educational tools through iPads.\nDoctors are already adept at using mobile devices and many have been using iPads in their practices for a number of years now, but allowing patients\u2019 access to their own information is still a novel idea in the medical world. Cedars has been somewhat ahead of the curve with the creation of its EHR software My CS-Link, which allows patients to look up their information online, including notes from their doctor.\nHowever, without the iPad, doctors and nurses have to follow a paper trail and then write up duplicate information on a white board often found on the back wall in the patient\u2019s room. Mistakes can happen and, as Cedars-Sinai doctor Shaun Miller told me, the staff often run out of room to write, leading to confusion or a lack of information for the patient.\nCedars uses Epic\u2019s MyChart software to record vitals and other info on roughly 50 iPads in its heart failure unit, where patients often have to stay for an extended period of time. One patient, 32-year-old Awad Lsallum, traveled all the way from Saudi Arabia in hopes of receiving a new heart. To be honest, Lsallum did not seem that impressed with the device. He\u2019d already been at Cedars for a total of 40 days and said he gave the iPad back after a while. But he did say it was \u201ccomforting\u201d to have the iPad so he \u201cknows what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nThe program also benefits the care team. Michelle Williams, a registered nurse at Cedars, told TechCrunch the program made it easier for nurses. The nursing staff often get stuck with duplicate work, requiring both educating patients on care and checking to see if they have all the necessary information. However, the program offers educational videos on the iPad and a handy way for patients to see all their information at the same time.\nIn another section of the hospital, new parents are utilizing unmodified iPads to FaceTime with their newborns who may be sick or premature. These babies need to be kept isolated from the outside world and the germs that come with it, so new parents aren\u2019t usually able to see their baby for a few days after they are born. But, with what the nurses refer to as BabyTime (FaceTime for babies), parents can interact virtually with their little one while they wait.\nOther hospitals, including those mentioned above, have embraced Apple\u2019s tools as well. The trick now is to place these devices into the patients\u2019 hands \u2014 something both Apple and Cedars-Sinai seem to be trying to do.\nOf course, these devices come with a few security headaches \u2014 even more so when you open up the information to patients. But despite the worries, Miller welcomes the new technology.\nA year in and he says, \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier now to communicate,\u201d adding the next step would be \u201copening up APIs and adding data standards so [the information] is accurate.\u201d",

        "title": "KGI: iPhone 8 features highest screen-to-body ratio in industry, but no Touch ID in screen",
        "body": "KGI\u2019s Ming-Chi Kuo has sent out a new report with his top predictions for the 2017 iPhone lineup: two iterative updates to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, as well as the all-new OLED iPhone 8. The analyst believes that the iPhone 8 will feature the highest screen-to-body ratio of any phone on the market, thanks to the addition of the \u2018notch\u2019 at the top of the screen and a virtual home button.\nHowever, KGI dampens spirits by stating that the virtual home button will not support fingerprint recognition, and that the OLED iPhone will not include a Touch ID sensor of any kind \u2026\nThe KGI report is a summary of many recent rumors as well as some new tidbits. KGI appears to confirm the dummy hardware leaks of the almost bezel-less iPhone 8 with minimal surround on all four sides except from a lip at the top to incorporate the front cameras and earpiece. KGI calls this the \u2018notch\u2019.\nThe OLED iPhone will have a 5.8-inch display (KGI reiterates claims that the usable screen area will be around 5.2-inches after accounting for the \u2018function area\u2019). As reported before, the smaller bezels will mean the overall phone is of a similar size to the current 4.7-inch iPhone 7.\nThe two LCD phones will have standard 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens, with the front face resembling the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Whereas the iPhone 8 chassis will be made of stainless steel and glass, it is believed the \u2018iPhone 7s\u2019 devices will have glass backs and an aluminium frame.\nAll three phones will include support for wireless charging (\u2018WPC standard\u2019) but the actual charging \u2018pad\u2019 (for lack of a better word) will be an additional purchase.\nKGI\u2019s exact wording around the fingerprint sensor situation is a bit ambiguous. The analyst indicates that the virtual Home Button \u2014 drawn on the OLED screen \u2014 will not support a fingerprint sensor (rebutting recent reports from the supply chain) under the display panel.\nIn fact, Kuo goes further and say that there will be no fingerprint recognition capability on the iPhone 8 of any kind; it seems like Apple is removing Touch ID entirely in favour of facial recognition.\nWe predict the OLED model won\u2019t support fingerprint recognition, reasons being: (1) the full-screen design doesn\u2019t work with existing capacitive fingerprint recognition, and (2) the scan-through ability of the under-display fingerprint solution still has technical challenges\nKuo said that the under-display fingerprint scanner faced many technical issues which prevented Apple from committing to the technology. We have seen speculation that Apple might put the Touch ID on the rear or in the power button, but today\u2019s KGI report is pretty definitive in their view that the iPhone 8 will not include a fingerprint sensor anywhere on the phone.\nThe front camera system on the iPhone 8 will support 3D depth sensing, enabling facial recognition authentication and \u2018improved\u2019 selfies. Internally, the OLED iPhone and the 5.5-inch iPhone \u20187s Plus\u2019 will include 3 GB RAM whilst the new 4.7-inch phone will continue to pack 2 GB RAM.\nAs another enhancement for the OLED iPhone, Apple will apparently improve the consistency of the speaker and the receiver to create more balanced stereo sounds. KGI also thinks that the OLED iPhone 8 will be offered in fewer colors than the normal iPhone lineup to maintain a \u2019boutique\u2019 branding.\nKGI suggests that all three new iPhones will come in 64 GB and 256 GB storage options, corroborating other claims, and all three will rely on Lightning for power although there will be an embedded USB-C power deliver circuit for faster charging speeds. This is something KGI first reported in March. Apple will continue to ship a USB-A to Lightning cable in the box, rather than jump to a USB-C adapter solution.\nIn terms of availability, KGI believes that Apple will announce all three new iPhone models at a September event but the all-new-design OLED iPhone may launch later than the iterative LCD phones. Kuo expects supply for the iPhone 8 to be constrained well into 2018.",

        "body": "If you\u2019re yet to adjust to a larger iPhone, it seems you\u2019re going to get left behind. A new report claims Apple has no plans to refresh the iPhone SE, its smallest and most affordable handset, which hasn\u2019t been properly updated since last March.\nIf you\u2019re an iPhone SE owner, you have one of the best 4-inch smartphones money can buy right now. It\u2019s likely still powerful enough to do everything you need it to do, and when iOS 11 makes its public debut this fall, you\u2019ll have no problem upgrading to it.\nBut when your handset starts to feel slow, and you begin to yearn for newer features offered by more recent devices, you may have no choice but to upgrade to a larger screen. Respected Chinese analyst Pan Jiutang does not expect Apple to refresh its smallest handset.\nThere simply isn\u2019t enough demand for smaller devices, Jiutang says. More and more of us want larger displays that are better for browsing the web, watching movies, and playing games. The vast majority are now accustomed to 5-inch screens and bigger.\nApple\u2019s plans could change later, but there\u2019s no denying the iPhone SE always felt like a temporary product. It carries exactly the same design as the iPhone 5, which launched in 2012, and offers the same specifications as a 2-year-old iPhone 6s.\nApple didn\u2019t have to put a great deal of effort into it; it was a simple move to appease those who weren\u2019t yet ready for its larger devices. Sure, it still sells, but it\u2019s likely a large portion of that demand is due to its price tag, rather than its screen size.\nWe will continue to see more affordable iPhones in Apple\u2019s lineup \u2014 it needs them to succeed in emerging markets like India \u2014 but it could be that the iPhone SE\u2019s design is phased out in favor of the more recent form factor of the iPhone 6 or even the iPhone 7 later on.\nFor now, however, it doesn\u2019t look like the current iPhone SE is going anywhere. Apple just launched a new manufacturing facility in India dedicated to the smaller handset.\nVia: The Bitbag",

        "title": "'Baby Driver' cut in real time with Avid on Apple's 15-inch MacBook Pro",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nHit film Baby Driver was cut essentially in real time on set on a MacBook Pro, cutting way back on the need for expensive post-primary photography re-shoots.\nIn an account published by The Beat film editor Paul Machliss called heist film Baby Driver the \"most difficult edit\" and \"the hardest job\" that he'd ever worked on. Machliss set up a 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro from before the 2016 relaunch to do the job actively on the set, to help assist with the tight choreography needed to sync the action with the heavily music-oriented action-filled script.\nUsing Avid, Machliss had the storyboards running on a lower video layer to help coordinate the action with the expected soundtrack. And, he did it all on the road, and outdoors.\n\"Roadside editing, you know, this is anywhere, anytime basically,\" Machliss told The Beat. \"This was for a climactic chase sequence, and you could literally wheelit out of the main truck and be ready for Edgar in minutes.\"\nAt one point, Machliss was in the rear of a process trailer, collecting footage as it was shot, to guarantee that re-shoots would be less of a problem after principal footage concluded.\nWhile there is no discussion about how well the computer itself held up, the production took a toll on the keyboard.\nBaby Driver tells the tale of the eponymous getaway driver, who cancels out tinnitus by constantly listening to music. The film is nearly always set to music that Baby is playing, with musical cues setting off action set pieces.",

        "title": "Former Google exec Vic Gundotra praises Apple iPhone 7 Plus camera, says Android photography years behind",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nFormer chief of Android Vic Gundotra praised Apple for its camera on the iPhone 7 Plus, and panned the Android ecosystem for a slow march in photography technology because of how innovations need to propagate across the entire codebase.\nIn a Facebook post on Sunday, accompanied with pictures that Gundotra took, the ex-Google executive called Android the problem for the reason it takes time it takes for new breakthroughs by companies like Samsung to get wide adoption \u2014 and even afterwards, confusion may reign.\nGundotra said:\nHere is the problem: It's Android. Android is an open source (mostly) operating system that has to be neutral to all parties. This sounds good until you get into the details. Ever wonder why a Samsung phone has a confused and bewildering array of photo options? Should I use the Samsung Camera? Or the Android Camera? Samsung gallery or Google Photos?\nIt's because when Samsung innovates with the underlying hardware (like a better camera) they have to convince Google to allow that innovation to be surfaced to other applications via the appropriate API. That can take YEARS.\nAlso the greatest innovation isn't even happening at the hardware level - it's happening at the computational photography level. (Google was crushing this 5 years ago - they had had \"auto awesome\" that used AI techniques to automatically remove wrinkles, whiten teeth, add vignetting, etc... but recently Google has fallen back).\nApple doesn't have all these constraints. They innovate in the underlying hardware, and just simply update the software with their latest innovations (like portrait mode) and ship it.\nBottom line: If you truly care about great photography, you own an iPhone. If you don't mind being a few years behind, buy an Android.\nOpponents of the post are noting the DxOMark ratings of Android phones \u2014 but appear to be missing the point. Gundotra is talking about the entire experience, from the lenses to the Phone's hardware, to the software, rather than just lens quality.",

        "title": "J.P. Morgan: OLED iPhone 8 will arrive on time in Sept. in small quantity, ASP of $1100",
        "body": "J.P. Morgan Apple analyst Rod Hall is out today with his latest forecast for the company\u2019s upcoming fiscal Q3 and beyond, and within includes predictions for the iPhone 8 launch this fall. Notably, the firm combats some recent reports that the flagship OLED model would be delayed, claiming that it expects the model to arrive at least in limited quantities in time for the usual September launch\u2026\nMore specifically, J.P. Morgan is reducing its prediction for shipments of the upcoming flagship device, which it refers to as the \u201ciPhone Pro\u201d, due to what it expects will be \u201ca slower production start for the flagship OLED phone.\u201d It doesn\u2019t however, think recent reports of delays will cause any material delay for the actual launch of the device apart from perhaps constrained supply as usual in the first month or two.\n\u2026we do not believe that Apple\u2019s production schedule is still changing materially with most current delay reports simply dated reverberations of decisions Apple made back in the spring. We expect a small amount of late September EMS output for the Pro model and then ramping production through October with target output levels achieved in late October/early November\nBut just how many will be available at launch? To reflect a slower start for production of the OLED iPhone model, J.P. Morgan is adjusting its forecast for the device from 9m units to ~2m units for September. It will, however, also increase its Y18 unit forecasts \u201cby about the same amount to reflect time-shifted demand.\u201d\nOur total iPhone shipments estimate for FQ4 is now 42.2m, reduced from our prior 49.5m forecast. Our FY18 iPhone shipments estimate is now 270.2m, up from our previous estimate of 262.9m\u2026\nThe report today from J.P. Morgan also adds to the many recent reports that the new flagship iPhones could debut with a higher average selling price. The firm is once again increasing its expectation for the average selling price by $100 to $1,100, noting that it believes \u201cproduction costs are slightly higher than we had originally anticipated.\u201d It thinks the higher average selling price will be a \u201ccritical demand control variable for a new tier of iPhone\u201d and that \u201cApple\u2019s pricing strategy is likely to be aimed at spreading this replacement cycle over two years given totally new product categories like AR are likely still a few years out.\u201d",

The third beta will also include many bug fixes, but could also focus more heavily on feature tweaks and changes. In iOS 11 beta 2, there were only a handful of changes, most notably the enabling of Do Not Disturb mode.\niOS 11 introduces some design changes, including a customizable Control Center and a new Lock screen that's merged with the Notification Center. Peer-to-peer Apple Pay payments are being introduced in the Messages app, which is also gaining a new App Drawer, and there's a new Do Not Disturb feature that is designed to help drivers stay focused on the road. Siri, Photos, the Camera app, and more are also gaining significant improvements.\nARKit for developers will result in a wide range of new augmented reality apps, while a Core ML SDK will allow apps to become a whole lot smarter. iOS 11 is also the biggest update ever for the iPad, with a new Dock that introduces much improved multitasking, a Files app for better managing files, improved Apple Pencil support, a revamped App Switcher, and system-wide drag and drop.\niOS 11 available for both registered developers and public beta testers. A second public beta test that's identical to the third developer beta should be released later this week.\nFor full details on all of the new features included in iOS 11, make sure to check out our extensive iOS 11 roundup.",

(32272318)\nSiri may use information from previous requests when completing the current request, even if Siri was closed between the requests. (33148434)Workaround: To begin a new request use the \u201cStart over\u201d Siri command.\nUsing Siri to correct the spelling of a transcribed request may result in an error.Workaround: Tap the misspelled word and correct it using the on-screen keyboard.\nWeather snippets currently show a sash icon from the iOS Weather app. The snippet should show the icon for The Weather Channel. It is also missing an attribution that opens The Weather Channel app. (31429437)\nUsers may encounter disambiguation issues while using Siri for Phone and Messages. (32477407)\nUsing Siri to disambiguate between multiple phone numbers for a contact sometimes does not work. (32591639)Workaround: Tap a selection in the UI. SiriKitResolved Issues\nSiri no longer loops when using SiriKit Notes queries to mark a reminder. (32398834)\nWhen a user verbally tries to disambiguate between two or more SiriKit apps in a disambiguation list, Siri now prompts for more details before opening an app. (32188589)\nSiriKit testing now works in Simulator. (32721342)\nIf the user does not mention the app name in the initial utterance, tapping the app in the disambiguation no longer launches the app instead of other possible Siri actions. (32361047)\nINImage objects constructed with URLs or image names now display correctly in the Siri UI. (31585381)Touch IDNew Issues\u2022 Touch ID does not work correctly with LocalAuthentication.framework in the iOS 11 Simulator Runtime. (33355624)Workaround: Test Touch ID functionality on-device or with an older runtime. UIKitResolved Issues\nSettingthedelaysContentTouchespropertyofUITableViewtofalsenowworks correctly and results in cells highlighting immediately on a touchdown event. (27102830)\nImportingadocumentusingUIDocumentPickerViewControllernowreturnsa copy of the document. (32358695)\nIn drag and drop, move operations are supported only when the drag and the drop both happen within the same app. Starting in beta 2, the value of UIDropSession.allowsMoveOperation is set to false. (32416557)\nTheviewargumentofthelocationInView:methodofUIDragSessionand UIDropSession is no longer nullable. The declaration of the method has changed to location(in view: UIView). (31714683)Known Issues\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController does not show UIDocumentPickerExtensionViewController app extensions in the list of sources. While these will be re enabled in a future beta, consider using an NSFileProviderExtension instead, as they are integrated in UIDocumentBrowserViewController instead of being presented in a separate sheet. (31975976)\nSettingthetextContentTypetousernameorpasswordforUITextFieldinthe previewProvider property of UIDragItem is not fully implemented. During the drag session, each change to the previewProvider causes an immediate update, regardless of which app changed it. In addition, clearing the previewProvider does not cause the preview to go back to its non-overridden state. (30385458)\nSettingthepreviewProviderpropertyofUIDragItemimmediatelyafterthedrag item is created has no effect. (32284908)Workarounds:Implement dragInteraction:previewForLiftingItem:session: in your drag interaction\u2019s delegate to change the lift preview. The preview carries over to the drag session.Change the preview during the drag session by setting previewProvider after the delegate\u2019s sessionWillBegin is called. If you are using UITableView or UICollectionView, there is no direct equivalent of that method, so you may use a delay instead.\nThecanLoadObjectsOfClasses:methodofUIDragDropSessionwillberemoved in a later seed. Use canLoadObjectOfClass: instead. (32242367)\nWhen dragging more than five items, the drop/cancel animation uses a default animation. The system calls the dropping/canceling preview calls for the first five of these items, even though they are not used. In a later beta, the system will not make these calls, and instead provides an additional API for animating alongside items for which a custom animation cannot be applied. (32299785)\nDonotusetheclassUIURLDragPreviewViewbecausewillberemovedinalaterbeta. To make drag previews of URLs, use UIDragPreview and UITargetedDragPreview. (32306613)\nTable views in Interface Builder documents compiled with Xcode 9.0 may have fixed heights for rows, section headers, and section footers, and may not self-size by default. (32188814)\nWorkaround: Set the table view rowHeight, sectionHeaderHeight, or sectionFooterHeight to UITableViewAutomaticDimension after the table view has been instantiated.\nUITableView has a new system gesture for quickly selecting rows. A two-finger tap on table views that support multiple selection sets the table view to editing, if it is not already, and selects the tapped row. Unlike a single-finger tap, which toggles selection, the two- finger tap always selects the tapped row and has no effect if the row is already selected. This new gesture is enabled only in apps built for iOS 11. (29127664)\nUITableView has a new property, separatorInsetReference, that changes how a custom value set in the separatorInset property is interpreted. By default, the value is .fromCellEdges, which means that custom separatorInset values are always interpreted as an inset from the edges of the cell, even in cases where table view would normally use larger automatic insets for the separator, such as a very wide table view when the cellLayoutMarginsFollowReadableWidth property is true.Set the separatorInsetReference to .fromAutomaticInsets to use the separatorInset as a fixed distance from the automatic inset that a table view would normally use.Note that you can always use UITableViewAutomaticDimension for any edge of the separatorInset that you set, to receive the automatic inset on that edge. (31000402)\nTable views now use estimated heights by default, which also means that cells and section header/footer views now self-size by default. The default value of the estimatedRowHeight, estimatedSectionHeaderHeight, and estimatedSectionFooterHeight properties is now UITableViewAutomaticDimension, which means the table view selects an estimated height to use. You should still provide a more accurate estimate for each property if possible, which is your best guess of the average value of the actual heights. If you have existing table view code that behaves differently when you build your app with the iOS 11 SDK, and you don\u2019t want to adopt self-sizing, you can restore the previous behavior by disabling estimated heights by setting a value of zero for each estimated height property. (30197915)\nAddingcustomsubviewsdirectlytoUITableViewisnotsupportedandmightbreakina future iOS release. (29094519)\nThe behavior of the delete swipe action has been changed.When implementing commitEditingStyle: to delete a swiped row, delete the row in the data source and call deleteRowsAtIndexPaths: on the table view to show the swipe delete animation. Not calling deleteRowsAtIndexPaths inside of this method results in the swiped row resetting to its resting position. Do not display a confirmation dialog in the implementation of this method, and support undo to allow canceling a deletion. To show a confirmation dialog, use a UIContextualAction instead (described next).\nWhen implementing a destructive UIContextualAction, delete the row in the data source and call the completion handler with true. Do not call deleteRowsAtIndexPaths: in this case. If the deletion fails, call the completion false to cancel the deletion. Although it should generally be avoided, you can show a confirmation dialog to confirm the deletion, and then call the completion handler with true if the user confirms (after deleting the row from its data source), or with false if the user cancels. It is also advised to disable performsFirstActionWithFullSwipe on the UISwipeActionsConfiguration in this case. Note that the completion handler must be called in all cases. (31588888)\nWhen the user selects one of the Accessibility Larger Text content sizes as their preferred content size, UITableViewCell uses a new default layout that is optimized for the larger sizes. The numberOfLines property of UITableViewCell labels (both textLabel and detailTextLabel) changes to 0 (unlimited) by default when the Accessibility content sizes are in use. You may override this by explicitly setting the numberOfLines property. The standard image view and accessory views are aligned with the first line of text in the cell, and cell text wraps around the image in order to maximize the amount of text displayed per line. For the Value1, Value2, and Subtitle styles, the detailTextLabel is arranged underneath the standard textLabel. For UISwitch accessory views, the switch is located below the labels and aligned with the leading edge of the text. Because of these changes, which increase the height of the cell content at Accessibility content sizes, it\u2019s important to use self-sizing cells to ensure that the row height increases as necessary, and to avoid using a fixed row height for all content sizes. (28102750)\nTheimageNamed:inBundle:compatibleWithTraitCollection:classmethod of UIImage now properly infers the UIDisplayGamut trait if it is not explicitly provided.If you are deploying to earlier versions of iOS, to provide the UIDisplayGamut trait in the trait collection, you pass to imageNamed:inBundle:compatibleWithTraitCollection:. You can obtain the correct value of this trait from the window or view that will display the image. Failing to provide the value can result in images failing to load on devices with P3 displays if the sRGB renditions of those images had been thinned out of the asset catalog. (29915518)\nUINavigationItem.searchController appears only for view controllers that use a UIScrollView. (32511772)Workaround: Set UINavigationItem.hidesSearchBarWhenScrolling to false.\nBy default, UIKit logging occurs only when unsatisfiable constraints are detected. Use the UIConstraintBasedLayoutThrowExceptionOnUnsatisfiableConstraints launch argument to add an assertion for early detection of the problem. The launch argument works in iOS 11 and later. (28123998)\nAUIViewthatmakesvisualchangesbothbyoverridingdrawRect:andbysettingthe layer contents may result in visual artifacts or other errors in iOS 11. Apps should use only one of the methods to make visual changes to a view. (31350188)\nVision\nResolved Issues\nVision now supports other Core ML feature vectors in addition to classifiers. iOS 11 beta 2 and earlier worked only with classifier models. (32944774)\nTheRectangleTrackerAPIshouldshouldnolongerstoprespondingunexpectedly. (32332200)\nThe Vision API is now available from the macOS 10.13 and iOS 11 SDKs even if DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is set to a version earlier than the current OS.Known Issues\u2022 Facial landmarks identified by the Vision framework may flicker in temporal use cases such as video. (32406440)Deprecations\n\u2022 The type of the orientation parameter in Vision framework calls has changed from an Int32 to an CGImagePropertyOrientation enum found in the ImageIO framework.\nImportant: Update your code with the new type to avoid compilation warnings or errors related to the change.\nwatchOS\nResolved Issues",

The sweeping blue arcs and curves helped set the tone of the new Aqua interface.\nDownload 5K version.\nDownload 6K version.\n10.2 Jaguar\nJaguar took the same Aqua-inspired theme but added some depth and motion to things. In my head, the trails streaking across the screen were from a set of comets.\nDownload 5K version.\nDownload 6K version.\n10.3 Panther\nWhile Panther inflicted Macs everywhere with Brushed Metal, its wallpaper stayed on brand, refreshing the original 10.0 image.\nDownload 5K version.\nDownload 6K version.\n10.4 Tiger\nMany consider Tiger to be the best \u201cclassic\u201d version of Mac OS X. While that may or may not be true, it is my favorite Aqua-inspired wallpaper.\nDownload 5K version.\nDownload 6K version.\n10.5 Leopard\nComplete with a revised, unified user interface and shiny new Dock, 10.5 broke the Aqua mold. As such, Leopard was the first version of OS X to break from the Aqua-themed wallpaper. It ushered in the \u201cspace era\u201d of OS X wallpapers, which was used heavily in the new Time Machine interface as well.\nDownload 5K version.\nDownload 6K version.\n10.5 Leopard Server\nThe server version of Leopard server came with its own unique wallpaper that is a real treat:\nDownload 5K version.\nDownload 6K version.\n10.6 Snow Leopard\nThe \u201cno new features\u201d mantra for Snow Leopard didn\u2019t ban a new wallpaper, thankfully. This starscape is still one of my favorites. The Server version isn\u2019t bad either!\nDownload 5K version.\nDownload 6K version.\nDownload 5K version.\nDownload 6K version.\n10.7 Lion\nLion kept up the space theme, this time showing off the Andromeda galaxy. The space nerd in me likes the idea, but the execution of this one leaves dead-last on my list of favorites.\nDownload 5K version.\nDownload 6K version.\n10.8 Mountain Lion\nJust like Snow Leopard before it, with Mountain Lion, Apple opted to clean up and revise the existing theme as opposed to changing directions for what would be a less-impactful release of OS X.\nDownload 5K version.\nDownload 6K version.\n10.9 Mavericks\nMavericks marked the beginning of Apple\u2019s \u201cCalifornia location\u201d naming scheme for Mac releases. The wave depicted looks as intimidating as the ones in the famous surfing location.\nDownload 5K version.\nDownload 6K version.\n10.10 Yosemite\nYosemite brought another UI refresh to the Mac, making things flatter and more modern.

        "title": "Apple removed the iPod nano and iPod shuffle from its website",
        "body": "Apple today removed the iPod nano and iPod shuffle from its website and online store around the world, and it has since confirmed the iconic portable media players have been discontinued. Apple continues to sell the iPod touch with updated pricing and storage, including a 32GB model for $199 and 128GB model for $299.\nFor now, it appears the iPod nano and iPod shuffle are still available to purchase at many Apple Stores and other resellers, but that likely won't be the case for too much longer. In the United States, the latest iPod nano started at $149 with 16GB of storage, while the iPod shuffle cost $49 with 2GB of storage.\nBeyond new colors and storage capacities, Apple had last updated the iPod nano in October 2012 and the iPod shuffle in September 2010 . Apple last updated the iPod touch in July 2015 with an A8 chip and an 8-megapixel rear camera.\nApple introduced the iPod shuffle in January 2005, followed by the iPod nano in September 2005. In total, there were seven generations of the iPod nano, and four generations of the iPod shuffle.\niPod sales had been declining for several years. Apple reported 2.6 million iPods sold in the fourth quarter of 2014. Since then, Apple has grouped iPod sales under its \"Other Products\" category in earnings results. iPod sales peaked at 54.8 million in 2008, compared to 14.3 million in 2014.\nThe success of the iPod, first introduced in 2001 by the late Steve Jobs, helped Apple reestablish itself as one of the world's most successful technology companies at the turn of the millenium. But, after the iPhone launched in 2007, the iPod nano and iPod shuffle became increasingly niche products.\nUpdate: \"Today, we are simplifying our iPod lineup with two models of iPod touch, now with double the capacity starting at just $199, and we are discontinuing the iPod shuffle and iPod nano,\" an Apple spokesperson told Business Insider.",

        "title": "iOS 11 prevents your iPhone from automatically connecting to patchy Wi-Fi",
        "body": "A new iOS 11 feature has shown up in the software\u2019s most recent beta release that should be quite helpful for travelers and those who find themselves using a lot of public Wi-Fi. The change, not publicized by Apple but noticed instead by beta users, automatically disables auto-join for Wi-Fi networks with poor connectivity. The auto-join button itself was first added in an earlier version of the iOS 11 beta, and it can be found by tapping on the small blue \u201ci\u201d icon next to any Wi-Fi network.\nNow, when you\u2019re looking to connect in a public place with a slew of mobile hot spots, you can let the software automatically scrub the worst offenders from the list. It also prevents the scourge that is an Xfinity hot spot from overriding your iPhone\u2019s network connection without you noticing. If you have \u201cAsk to Join Networks\u201d turned on, the feature will put an end to those needless notifications that pop up whenever you walk by your local Starbucks.\nThe automatic disabling of auto-join is a nice, subtle feature, one of those \u201chow did this not exist before?\u201d ideas that Apple is known for implementing with ease. In this case, however, it looks like the company borrowed a bit from Android, which has had a version of the feature in one of form or another for years now. For instance, Samsung has a feature called Smart Network Switch, which switches to mobile data when a Wi-Fi signal is weak. Verizon and Samsung also provided a similar feature back in 2014 with the Galaxy S5. Both of these informed Apple\u2019s Wi-Fi Assist, which debuted in iOS 9 two years ago.",

        "title": "Public Service Announcement: You Should Not Force Quit Apps on iOS",
        "body": "Public Service Announcement: You Should Not Force Quit Apps on iOS\nThe single biggest misconception about iOS is that it\u2019s good digital hygiene to force quit apps that you aren\u2019t using. The idea is that apps in the background are locking up unnecessary RAM and consuming unnecessary CPU cycles, thus hurting performance and wasting battery life.\nThat\u2019s not how iOS works. The iOS system is designed so that none of the above justifications for force quitting are true. Apps in the background are effectively \u201cfrozen\u201d, severely limiting what they can do in the background and freeing up the RAM they were using. iOS is really, really good at this. It is so good at this that unfreezing a frozen app takes up way less CPU (and energy) than relaunching an app that had been force quit. Not only does force quitting your apps not help, it actually hurts. Your battery life will be worse and it will take much longer to switch apps if you force quit apps in the background.\nHere\u2019s a short and sweet answer from Craig Federighi, in response to an email from a customer asking if he force quits apps and whether doing so preserves battery life: \u201cNo and no.\u201d\nHere, from the official support document on forcing applications to close, is Apple\u2019s own advice on when to use this feature:\nWhen you double-click the Home button, your recently used apps appear. The apps aren\u2019t open, but they\u2019re in standby mode to help you navigate and multitask. You should force an app to close only when it\u2019s unresponsive.\nUpdate: MacDailyNews quotes a 2010 email from Steve Jobs:\nJust use [iOS multitasking] as designed, and you\u2019ll be happy. No need to ever quit apps.\nJust in case you don\u2019t believe Apple\u2019s senior vice president for software, Apple\u2019s own official support documentation, or Steve Jobs, here are some other articles pointing out how this habit is actually detrimental to iPhone battery life:\nThis thing about force quitting apps in the background is such a pernicious myth that I\u2019ve heard numerous stories from DF readers about Apple Store Genius Bar staff recommending it to customers. Those \u201cgeniuses\u201d are anything but geniuses.\nIt occurs to me that some of the best examples proving that this notion is wrong (at least in terms of performance) are YouTube \u201cspeed test\u201d benchmarks. There\u2019s an entire genre of YouTube videos devoted to benchmarking new phones by running them through a series of apps and CPU-intensive tasks repeatedly, going through the loop twice. Once from a cold boot and the second time immediately after the first loop. Here\u2019s a perfect example, pitting a Samsung Galaxy S8 against an iPhone 7 Plus. Note that no apps are manually force quit on either device. The iPhone easily wins on the first loop, but where the iPhone really shines is on the second loop. The S8 has to relaunch all (or at least almost all) of the apps, because Android has forced them to quit while in the background to reclaim the RAM they were using. On the iPhone, all (or nearly all) of the apps re-animate almost instantly.\nIn fact, apps frozen in the background on iOS unfreeze so quickly that I think it actually helps perpetuate the myth that you should force quit them: if you\u2019re worried that background apps are draining your battery and you see how quickly they load from the background, it\u2019s a reasonable assumption to believe that they never stopped running. But they did. They really do get frozen, the RAM they were using really does get reclaimed by the system, and they really do unfreeze and come back to life that quickly.1\nAn awful lot of very hard work went into making iOS work like this. It\u2019s a huge technical advantage that iOS holds over Android. And every iPhone user in the world who habitually force quits background apps manually is wasting all of the effort that went into this while simultaneously wasting their own device\u2019s battery life and making everything slower for themselves.\nThis pernicious myth is longstanding and seemingly will not die. I wrote about it at length back in 2012:\nLike with any voodoo, there are die-hard believers. I\u2019m quite certain that I am going to receive email from people who will swear up-and-down that emptying this list of used applications every hour or so keeps their iPhone running better than it would otherwise. Nonsense. As Fraser mentions, yes, there are exceptional situations where an app with background privileges can get stuck, and you need to kill that app. The argument here is not that you should never have to kill any app using the multitasking switcher \u2014 the argument is that you don\u2019t need to do it on a regular basis, and you\u2019re not making anything \u201cbetter\u201d by clearing the list. Shame on the \u201cgeniuses\u201d who are peddling this advice.\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on people who completely power down their iPhones while putting them back into their pockets or purses.",

        "title": "Apple Park drone footage may be ending, with security forces seeking to cease flights",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nThe latest drone footage from Apple park shows the march of progress towards completion, but it is not clear how many more videos there will be of the campus. with Apple reportedly cracking down on drone pilots in the area.\nThe latest footage from Apple Park shows a glimpse inside the now unclad Steve Jobs Theater, work underway in the atrium, the historic barn re-assembled completely, and the manmade pond nearly ready for water. Additionally, a large amount of progress has been made on the visitor's center, showing a roof resembling the Chicago remodeled store.\nAppleInsider has also learned that there is a security force intended to halt these flyovers. Another drone pilot claims that they were stopped by a hired security guard who has the express purpose of shutting down drone flights over the campus.\nAt present, Apple Park is not listed as a \"no-fly\" area by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, nor could AppleInsider locate any filing for the \"Controlled Airspace\" status at this time. Current FAA guidance requires drones to keep 360 feet away from structures, and mandates that the user must maintain visual line-of-sight to the device at all times.\nNavigable airspace above 500 feet is limited to manned airplanes. FAA guidance allows drones to fly below an altitude 400 feet to ground level, but there are court rulings from the mid-20th century that suggest that a landowner owns up to 365 feet \u2014 so a legal battle is imminent.\nApple could have an avenue for restrictions, if they can demonstrate that the drones are causing a nuisance, or are violating one of California's privacy laws. Drones landing or being flown from private property can result in a trespassing charge.\nOn Feb. 22, Apple officially named the \"spaceship\" campus under construction. The entire facility is now called \"Apple Park,\" with the 20-foot tall and 165 foot in diameter glass auditorium honoring one of the founders of the company and named the \"Steve Jobs Theater.\"\nBefore the massive construction effort started, the area was Hewlett Packard's land, and was essentially completely paved over. Apple's demand for trees is reportedly putting pressure on the local market, forcing contractors to source from outside California. The final tree count is expected to approach 9,000, with apple, apricot, cherry, and persimmon trees dotting the landscape.\nAn environmentally-friendly design was paramount to Jobs's vision, and Apple's related Phase 2 project adds additional workspace adjacent to the main headquarters, and includes a small data center powered by the on-site solar farm, fuel cells, and other sources of renewable energy.",
