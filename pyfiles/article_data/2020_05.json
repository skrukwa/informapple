        "title": "Students are failing AP tests because the College Board website can\u2019t handle iPhone HEIC photos",
        "body": "Nick Bryner, a high school senior in Los Angeles, had just completed his AP English Literature and Composition test last week. But when he snapped a photo of a written answer with his iPhone and attempted to upload it to the testing portal, it stopped responding.\nThe website got stuck on the loading screen until Bryner\u2019s time ran out. Bryner failed the test. He\u2019s retaking it in a few weeks.\nBryner is among the many high school students around the country who completed Advanced Placement tests online last week but were unable to submit them at the end. The culprit: image formats.\nScreenshot: College Board\nFor the uninitiated: AP exams require longform answers. Students can either type their response or upload a photo of handwritten work. Students who choose the latter option can do so as a JPG, JPEG, or PNG format according to the College Board\u2019s coronavirus FAQ.\nBut the testing portal doesn\u2019t support the default format on iOS devices and some newer Android phones, HEIC files. HEIC files are smaller than JPEGs and other formats, thus allowing you to store a lot more photos on an iPhone. Basically, only Apple (and, more recently, Samsung) use the HEIC format \u2014 most other websites and platforms don\u2019t support it. Even popular Silicon Valley-based services, such as Slack, don\u2019t treat HEICs the same way as standard JPEGs.\nBryner says many of his classmates also tried to submit iPhone photos and experienced the same problem. The issue was so common that his school\u2019s AP program forwarded an email from the College Board to students on Sunday including tidbits of advice to prevent submission errors.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s devastating is that thousands of students now have an additional three weeks of stressful studying for retakes,\u201d Bryner said.\nIn a statement emailed to The Verge, the College Board said that \u201cthe vast majority of students successfully completed their exams\u201d in the first few days of online testing, \u201cwith less than 1 percent unable to submit their responses.\u201d The company also noted that \u201cWe share the deep disappointment of students who were unable to submit responses.\u201d\nThe email Bryner received doesn\u2019t mention the HEIC format, though it does link to the College Board\u2019s website, which instructs students with iPhones to change their camera settings so that photos save as JPEGs rather than HEICs. The company also linked to that information in a tweet early last week.\nThe advice, however, was too late for many students. One senior, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid repercussions from school, said that the College Board\u2019s tweet went out just a few minutes before his Physics C test began. \u201cNo one taking the AP Physics test would have been able to see it because we were already logged into the test,\u201d he said.\nSenior Dave Spencer took a demo test before his Calculus AB exam to make sure he understood the process for uploading photos. He Airdropped an iPhone image of his responses to his Mac and tried to convert it by renaming the HEIC file to PNG. Changing a file\u2019s extension does not guarantee that it will be converted, but Spencer was still able to submit the demo test with no problem.\nSpencer used the same process on the real exam and thought it went through, but he received an email the next day saying the files were corrupted and that he needed to retake the test. The College Board\u2019s tweet went out just a few hours before Spencer\u2019s scheduled exam; he doesn\u2019t have a Twitter account and didn\u2019t see it.\n\u201cThis is absolutely unacceptable.\u201d\n\u201cThis is absolutely unacceptable, as some kids may not have Twitter like me,\u201d Spencer said in a text message. \u201cThat nuance was not addressed anywhere in the demo.\u201d\nEverly Kai, a senior in British Columbia, had the same problem with Computer Science A last week \u2014 she attempted to rename the file to JPEG and received the same email a few hours after submitting her test.\n\u201cIt was honestly a bit devastating,\u201d Kai said in a text. \u201cI studied almost the entirety of the previous week and feel I did quite well, only to realize it was for nothing and I\u2019d have to go through the entire stressful process again.\u201d\nBryner thinks the clarification isn\u2019t enough, even for students who are taking the test later. \u201cMost students are probably going to continue to run into this,\u201d he said. Bryner doesn\u2019t think the company should have expected him and his classmates to jump through so many hoops. \u201cTo flip the switch from HEIC to JPEG is buried in settings, and something that no one is thinking about going into the test,\u201d he said.\n\u201cStudents are going to continue to run into this.\u201d\nEven students who knew about the HEIC problem have had trouble figuring out how to fix it, especially in the high-pressure testing environment. Sean S., a junior from Chicago who took Calculus AB, used OneDrive to port a photo to his Windows desktop from his iPhone, then attempted to convert the file with Windows Photo. Due to the photo\u2019s size, the conversion took over five minutes. Then, before the JPEG had fully submitted, his time ran out. (Sean requested to be identified only by his first name and last initial because his parents didn\u2019t want his name in the news.)\nLuckily, it sounds like students will have more recourse in the future. The College Board is now allowing test-takers who have issues submitting their tests to email them instead \u2014 iPhones convert HEICs to JPEGs automatically when they\u2019re attached to emails in the Mail app. If you fail to submit, you\u2019ll immediately receive a notification and a unique email address to use. This option is only available for future exams, however \u2014 it won\u2019t help Bryner and others who failed their tests last week.\nTens of thousands of students are demanding that the College Board do more. Following technical issues with her own test last week, Los Angeles senior Eliana Sisman created a petition calling on the company to allow her and fellow students to resubmit their previous work. The petition has collected over 23,000 signatures.\n\u201cI thank the College Board for setting up a re-submission channel for students taking APs this week,\u201d Sisman said in a statement to The Verge. \u201cI urge them to be fair to students who\u2019ve already taken the APs and can\u2019t submit them. Many students will be in the military or working at summer jobs by June 1st and won\u2019t be able to take the makeup test.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cIf the college board does this, they will make it clear to everyone that they are a responsible and caring community institution.\u201d\nCorrection May 20th, 5:20PM ET: Eliana Sisman\u2019s statement originally read \u201cI thank the College Board for setting up a re-submission channel for students taking APs this year.\u201d After publication, Sisman contacted The Verge to say she\u2019d made a mistake and she meant \u201cweek,\u201d rather than \u201cyear.\u201d We have updated the text.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nApple's current Apple Watch Series 5\nA new leak claims that the Apple Watch Series 6 will add mental health features, longer battery life, and an expansion of existing sensors so the device can measure blood oxygenation.\nApple's forthcoming update to the Apple Watch, presumed to be called the Series 6, is now rumored to include features to do with monitoring users for mental health issues, including anxiety. Twitter user Nikias Molina has no known previous track in Apple information, but has now details which have tersely confirmed by prolific leaker Jon Prosser.\nEXCLUSIVE leaks about the upcoming #AppleWatch Series 6 features.\nSleep Tracking\nLonger Battery Life\nPulse Oximeter\nS6 Chip\nMental Health Abnormalities Detection\nStay tuned for more. pic.twitter.com/fN0j6xmOMA \u2014 Nikias Molina #BeHappy (@NikiasMolina) April 30, 2020\nMolina says that the Apple Watch Series 6 will contain a long-rumored sleep tracking, plus a previously unknown series of mental health abnormalities detection. These will be in part an extension of the current heart rate monitoring, and look for signs of unusual anxiety in users.\nAsked about this plus Molina's claim that the Series 6 will feature longer battery life, a pulse oximeter, and run on an S6 chip, Jon Prosser tweeted \"Yep!\" with no more details. Molina claims he has more to follow at some unspecified time.\nThe Apple Watch, as it stands, has a heart rate sensor that has been used as a pulse oximeter in other medical-grade devices. The functionality is not enabled at this time, and would require FDA approval for use by consumers as a health monitoring device similar to what it had to get for the electrocardiogram technology.\nThe addition of sleep tracking to the Apple Watch in 2020 has been rumored before. Addition of sleep tracking would require more battery life, as most users presently charge the device at night. Alternatively, a low-powered implementation, and Apple shifting to some kind of faster Qi-related charging than it currently uses could only mandate a quick charge in the morning.",

        "body": "Apple officially released the new iPhone SE earlier this month, and Tim Cook says the company is seeing a positive response from reviewers and customers alike. Cook touted that the iPhone SE packs a great value and is \u201cfaster than the fastest Android phones.\u201d\nCook\u2019s comments came in response to a question about how well the new iPhone SE might sell in specific geographic areas. Cook said that while it could \u201ceven better\u201d in areas with lower median incomes, he expects it to attract a \u201cfair number\u201d of Android switchers as well.\nThe benefit of the iPhone SE, Cook explained, is that it packs the \u201cengine\u201d of the iPhone 11 inside a smaller and more affordable form factor:\n\u201cIt plays in every geo, but I would expect to see it doing even better where the median incomes are less. I\u2019d expect some fair number of people switching over to iOS. It\u2019s an unbelievable offer. It\u2019s the engine of our top phones, in a very affordable package, and it\u2019s faster than the fastest Android phones. It\u2019s an exceptional value.\u201d\nCook was also asked whether the new iPhone SE is part of Apple\u2019s plans to adjust the pricing structure of the iPhone lineup. He disputed this, instead saying that Apple has always tried to deliver strong products at good prices:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been about delivering the best product at a good price. That fundamental strategy has not changed at all. As you know, we did have an SE for a while. It\u2019s great to bring it back, it was a beloved product. I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it other than that we want to give people the best deal that we can while making the best product.\u201d\nCatch up on our full coverage of Apple\u2019s Q2 2020 earnings release here.\nRead more:",

        "title": "Apple Is Reportedly Looking To Move 20% Of Its Production To India From China",
        "body": "> Tech\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted supply chains of companies around the world and has made some of them reconsider the chain as this reliance on Chinese manufacturers has revealed vulnerabilities during the current situation. Hence, looking to diversify its production, Apple is reportedly looking to move nearly 1/5th of its production from China to India.\nA report by ET reveals that Apple executives have been in touch with Indian government officials for the last few months and are now considering the possibility of moving a considerable chunk of their manufacturing operations to India through Apple\u2019s contract manufacturers.\n\"We expect Apple to produce up to $40 billion worth of smartphones, mostly for exports through its contract manufacturers Wistron and Foxconn, availing the benefits under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme,\" a senior government official told ET.\nFor the uninitiated, the PLI scheme was recently introduced by the government to boost domestic manufacturing of mobile phones and specified electronic components. For a company to take benefit of the scheme that provides an incentive of a 4-6% on incremental sales (subject to conditions), the company must manufacture at least $10 billion worth of mobile phones in a phased manner between 2020 and 2025.\nThe report points out how far Apple currently is from achieving that number. Apple currently sells smartphones worth approx. $1.5 billion in India out of which only $.0.5 billion is manufactured in India.\niPhone XR\nApple already manufactures older iPhones, like the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 8, in India via Winstron and Foxconn. It recently also started the production of the iPhone XR in India. These phones are manufactured in India to support the local demand and the demand of nearby markets.\nSEE ALSO: iPhone 11 Helps Apple Put Strong Growth Numbers In India\nIf Apple does move a huge chunk of its manufacturing operations to India - to diversify its supply chain - it could also benefit from saving on import duties that are slapped on iPhones that aren\u2019t manufactured in India. India is the second-largest smartphone market in the world and Apple has a share of a mere 2% in the country. Manufacturing its latest smartphones here will help the Cupertino-based giant price their smartphones more competitively in what is probably the most important smartphone market in the world right now.\nAlthough, it isn\u2019t smooth sailing yet. The report also points out that there were some \u201cirritants\u201d for Apple in the government\u2019s PLI scheme. But if all goes well, and Apple does decide to move its manufacturing to India, it could provide a huge impetus to the \u201cMake in India\u201d programme and inspire other companies to follow suit.",

Richard Burr's Apple iCloud account as part of a probe into his stock trades, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nAn unnamed law enforcement official told the Times that FBI agents served Apple with the warrant and got hold of data that was then used as evidence to obtain a second warrant for the North Carolina senator's cellphone.\nAccording to the Times, the FBI seized the Republican lawmaker's cellphone on Wednesday night to assist with a Department of Justice investigation into stock sales Burr made at the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic.\nThe newspaper also reported that Justice Department investigators were looking at the North Carolina senator's conversations with his stock broker.\nSenator Richard Burr listens to testimony during the Senate Committee for Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing on May 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. Toni L. Sandys-Pool/Getty Images\nNewsweek has contacted Sen. Richard Burr's office for comment and will update this article with any response. Apple and the FBI have also been contacted for confirmation on the reported warrants against the Republican lawmaker.\nIn March Sen. Burr had sold between $628,000 and $1.7 million worth of stock in his portfolio on February 13 as he received coronavirus briefings in two Senate committees.\nThe controversial sales, first reported by ProPublica, took place before the stock market tumbled as the novel coronavirus began spreading across the country.\nSen. Burr's brother-in-law Gerald Fauth also reportedly dumped between $97,000 and $280,000 worth of stock on the same day. Sen. Burr has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or coordination with his brother-in-law relating to the trades.\nThe North Carolina Republican also asked the Senate Ethics Committee to open an investigation into his stock trades in mid-March, claiming that he \"relied solely on public news reports\" when making a decision on the trades.\n\"I closely followed CNBC's daily health and science reporting out of its Asia bureaus at the time,\" Burr said in a March statement.\nThe GOP lawmaker was one of only three senators to oppose the 2012 STOCK Act that bans insider trading by congressional lawmakers.

        "title": "Just turning your phone on qualifies as searching it, court rules: Location data requires a warrant since 2018; lock screen may now, too.",
        "body": "Smartphones are a rich data trove not only for marketers but also for law enforcement. Police and federal investigators love to get their hands on all that juicy personal information during an investigation. But thanks to the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution and all the case law built upon it, police generally need a warrant to search your phone\u2014and that includes just looking at the lock screen, a judge has ruled (PDF).\nUsually when the topic of a phone search comes up in court, the question has to do with unlocking. Generally, courts have held that law enforcement can compel you to use your body, such as your fingerprint (or your face), to unlock a phone but that they cannot compel you to share knowledge, such as a PIN. In this recent case, however, the FBI did not unlock the phone. Instead, they only looked at the phone's lock screen for evidence.\nA man from Washington state was arrested in May 2019 and was indicted on several charges related to robbery and assault. The suspect, Joseph Sam, was using an unspecified Motorola smartphone. When he was arrested, he says, one of the officers present hit the power button to bring up the phone's lock screen. The filing does not say that any officer present attempted to unlock the phone or make the suspect do so at the time.\nIn February 2020, the FBI also turned the phone on to take a photograph of the phone's lock screen, which displayed the name \"Streezy\" on it. Sam's lawyer filed a motion arguing that this evidence should not have been sought without a warrant and should therefore be suppressed.\nAdvertisement\nTwo issues\nDistrict Judge John Coughenour of the US District Court in Seattle agreed. In his ruling, the judge determined that the police looking at the phone at the time of the arrest and the FBI looking at it again after the fact are two separate issues. Police are allowed to conduct searches without search warrant under special circumstances, Coughenour wrote, and looking at the phone's lock screen may have been permissible as it \"took place either incident to a lawful arrest or as part of the police's efforts to inventory the personal effects\" of the person arrested. Coughenour was unable to determine how, specifically, the police acted, and he ordered clarification to see if their search of the phone fell within those boundaries.\nBut where the police actions were unclear, the FBI's were both crystal clear and counter to the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, Coughenour ruled. \"Here, the FBI physically intruded on Mr. Sam's personal effect when the FBI powered on his phone to take a picture of the phone's lock screen.\" That qualifies as a \"search\" under the terms of the Fourth Amendment, he found, and since the FBI did not have a warrant for that search, it was unconstitutional.\nAttorneys for the government argued that Sam should have had no expectation of privacy on his lock screen\u2014that is, after all, what everyone who isn't you is meant to see when they try to access the phone. Instead of determining whether the lock screen is private or not, though, Coughenour found that it doesn't matter. \"When the Government gains evidence by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area\u2014as the FBI did here\u2014it is 'unnecessary to consider' whether the government also violated the defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy,\" he wrote.\nBasically, he ruled, the FBI pushing the button on the phone to activate the lock screen qualified as a search, regardless of the lock screen's nature.",

        "title": "The Apple MacBook Air 2020 is 30% brighter when you use Windows",
        "body": "So why is that? Only Apple can give a definitive answer, but there are several possibilities:\nNot all the panels reach the same maximum brightness. Apple wants to make sure that the customers get comparable products, so the manufacturer limits the brightness to the advertised value (400 nits).\nAs we have mentioned before, the color accuracy is a bit worse when you use Windows, even after our calibration. It is possible that Apple can only ensure the better results at lower brightness levels.\nThe panel of the MacBook Air can reach much higher brightness levels than the advertised 400 nits, but Apple wants to keep the distance to the more expensive MacBook Pro 13. A brighter panel is a much better sales argument for many customers than a wider P3 color gamut.\nWe believe the last point makes a lot of sense, especially from a marketing perspective. We will also show how the different brightness levels will affect the battery runtime. This and many more topics will be covered in our full review of the MacBook Air 2020 Core i3, which will be published in a couple of days.",

With its collection of powerful creative features, Logic Pro X 10.5 will be a massive release for all musicians, including those producing electronic music.\n\u201cThe Mac and Logic Pro X are essential tools used by the world\u2019s top musicians and producers to create the music that we all love,\u201d said Susan Prescott, Apple\u2019s vice president of Apps Product Marketing. \u201cLogic Pro X 10.5 represents the biggest update to Logic since the launch of Logic Pro X, with powerful new tools that will inspire every artist \u2014 from those just getting started with Logic, to those already using it to produce Grammy Award-winning albums. We can\u2019t wait to hear what these artists create next.\u201d\nPro musicians and producers are already expressing their excitement for Logic Pro X 10.5, saying:\n\u201cLogic Pro X has always been my one and only DAW. The workflow is unmatched, and the built-in sound libraries have been essential to my music from the beginning. Now with the addition of Quick Sampler and Drum Machine Designer, I\u2019m getting back hours I used to spend in the studio building sounds and kits. This lets me spend more time writing new verses and editing 70-take vocals.\u201d \u2014 Finneas O\u2019Connell, Grammy Award-winning producer: Billie Eilish, \u201cBad Guy\u201d and the album \u201cWhen We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\u201d\n\u201cLogic Pro X 10.5 has changed the way we approach making music.

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nUnreal Engine 5\nThe newly announced cross-platform Unreal Engine 5, coming to Mac and iOS, utilizes new rendering techniques to achieve a whole new level of realism and detail.\nTwo new technologies will be introduced in the Unreal Engine update, which will enable game designers to make games with more detail and better design.\nThe first technology detailed is called \"Nanite.\" The new feature allows artists to use film-quality source material with no limit to the number of polygons used. To put it simply, photo-realistic assets like rocks and buildings will be able to be rendered without a limit to detail. Epic says that these high resolution textures and objects will make a game world feel more alive, allowing players to sink into cinematic experiences that they control.\nScenes like this were only possible during cutscenes before\nThe second technology called \"Lumen\" is a new global illumination solution. Lumen will perform all lighting calculations in real time to prevent annoying conditions like \"pop-in\" where shadows and details show up well after they are supposed to.\nUnreal Engine 5 uses Lumen to accomplish realistic lighting\nTo take full advantage of Unreal Engine 5, developers will need the latest in gaming hardware like the upcoming Playstation 5, or an advanced gaming PC. That doesn't leave other gamers out though, as the new engine works with all current consoles and iOS, Mac, and Android devices too. While you won't be able to achieve the same cinematic quality as those high end machines, a game using Unreal Engine 5 on your iPhone or iPad will still benefit from these new technologies.\nThe press release from Epic Games detail an early 2021 preview phase with a full release in late 2021. Developers who license Unreal Engine now can get started developing their games, as the next version will be fully forward compatible.",

        "body": "Apple is moving quickly to release new software features that improve lives during the COVID-19 health pandemic. One new feature that\u2019s aimed to help first responders will be useful for iPhone and Apple Watch users even after we reach the other side of the coronavirus outbreak. The change is coming in iOS 13.5 and watchOS 6.2.5 later this month.\nMedical ID\nApple Watch and iPhone have supported a feature called Medical ID that lets you collect critical health data in one place. Medical ID can include your contact information, date of birth, medical conditions, blood type, and more.\nMedical ID can be accessed from the Lock Screen on the iPhone without a passcode, or by holding the Side Button on an Apple Watch even if it\u2019s locked. The idea is that anyone can see important health information about you in a time of need even if you\u2019re not responsive.\nEmergency SOS\niPhone and Apple Watch offer a separate feature called Emergency SOS. When you hold down the Side Button on an iPhone and Apple Watch for several seconds, the device can call local emergency services for you.\nEmergency SOS also alerts your emergency contact when activated. This feature has been critical in saving lives by notifying first responders when an iPhone or Apple Watch user has an accident.\nMedical ID in Emergency Calls\nWhat\u2019s new in iOS 13.5 and watchOS 6.2.5 is a new capability that connects Medical ID and Emergency SOS together. Starting later this month, customers can opt into a new Emergency SOS feature that automatically shares Medical ID information with emergency services.\nThis helps first responders by reducing the need to ask about allergies, medications, and medical conditions. First responders will automatically receive this vital information from Medical ID when Emergency SOS is activated.\nMedical ID information is stored in iCloud in an encrypted format and encrypted when in transit. This privacy is maintained with the new capability by relying on Enhanced Emergency Data to securely share the data with first responders.\nApple Watch Series 4 and later also feature Fall Detection which automatically calls emergency services when a fall is detected and a user is unresponsive. The new Medical ID sharing feature will be used for Fall Detection as well.\nThe new feature is currently available in the beta versions of iOS and watchOS. Update to iOS 13.5 and watchOS 6.2.5 when the software updates are available later this month.\nRead More:",

        "body": "Apple today released a new firmware update for the AirPods Pro, upgrading the previous firmware, version 2C54 or 2B588, to the new firmware, 2D15.\nThere is no word on what's new in the refreshed firmware at this time, though there have been some complaints from \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c users about Active Noise Cancellation issues with the prior firmware.\nThere's no clear cut way to upgrade the firmware of the AirPods Pro, with the new firmware installed over-the-air while the AirPods are connected to an iOS device. Putting the \u200cAirPods\u200c in the case, connecting the \u200cAirPods\u200c to a power source, and then pairing the \u200cAirPods\u200c to an iPhone or an iPad should force the update after a short period of time.\nCheck your \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c firmware by following these steps:\nMake sure the \u200cAirPods\u200c are connected to your iOS device. Open the Settings app. Tap General. Tap About. Tap \u200cAirPods\u200c. Look at the number next to \"Firmware Version.\"\nApple in December released the 2C54 firmware update, but later pulled it, so some people who updated have the 2C54 firmware while others are still on 2B588.\n\u200cAirPods Pro\u200c firmware updates often include performance improvements, bug fixes, and feature tweaks, but we may not find out what's new as Apple does not provide any kind of release notes for \u200cAirPods updates. There is no update for the standard AirPods at this time.",

        "title": "LG gets orders for 20M OLED iPhone screens this year, ending Samsung monopoly",
        "body": "While Samsung has so far had the exclusive contract for flagship OLED iPhone screens, we learned last November that this is set to change \u2013 with LG coming on board as a second supplier for the iPhone 12 lineup. LG currently only makes displays for iPhones with LCD screens, along with a small number of OLED ones for older models.\nA new report out of Korea claims to have more details and says that LG has received orders for up to 20M OLED screens for this year\u2019s iPhones, with Samsung picking up the remaining 55M orders. If correct, the orders also give some insight into Apple\u2019s expectations for one of the four models expected \u2026\nBackground\nLast year, Apple launched three models, with OLED versus LCD as one of the distinguishing features:\niPhone 11 (LCD)\niPhone 11 Pro (OLED)\niPhone 11 Pro Max (OLED)\nThis year, we\u2019re expecting four models \u2013 two base ones, two pro ones, each in two sizes. While we don\u2019t know any of the names for sure, I\u2019m using here indicative names in line with current models:\n5.4-inch iPhone 12\n6.1-inch iPhone 12 Max\n6.1-inch iPhone 12 Pro\n6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max\nAll four are reported to have OLED screens, but the Pro models are still expected to have a more sophisticated display. Made by Samsung, and dubbed Y-OCTA, these will eliminate a separate touch sensor layer. This will make for a slightly thinner and clearer display.\nLatest report on OLED iPhone screens\nThe report from Korean site TheElec suggests that LG is picking up most or all orders for the 6.1-inch iPhone 12 Max, while Samsung gets the rest.\nLG Display will supply up to 20 million OLED panels to the iPhone 12 series this year. Samsung Display will produce approximately 55 million units and LG Display will produce approximately 20 million units from approximately 75 million OLED panels in the iPhone 12 series. In all four types of iPhone 12 series, LG Display produces panels for 6.1-inch iPhone 12 Max. The remaining 5.4 inch iPhone 12, 6.1 inch iPhone 12 Pro and 6.7 inch iPhone 12 Pro Max panels are supplied by Samsung Display.\nTechnically, LG has already broken Samsung\u2019s monopoly on OLED screens as Apple placed small-scale orders last year, but it is believed that LG has so far only made displays for older models. Other reports say LG also makes screens for refurbs of current models, though essentially only as a test-bed to demonstrate capabilities to Apple, rather than at any meaningful volume. Either way, this will be the first time anyone other than Samsung makes OLED screens for flagship models at launch.\nApple has long wanted to reduce its dependence on Samsung for OLED panels, but LG has reportedly struggled to meet both quality and volume requirements. The reported order suggests that Apple is now satisfied the supplier is able to do so.\nLG isn\u2019t the only player wanting to take some of Samsung\u2019s business away from it, however. Chinese company BOE has been trying hard to win orders from Apple, going so far as to invest in production lines devoted exclusively to iPhone displays. The report says Apple hasn\u2019t yet approved BOE as an OLED supplier, but the Chinese company will make another bid later.\nRender: Letsgodigital",

        "body": "Since macOS 10.12 there\u2019s a bug in Apple Mail that causes it to randomly become the frontmost application. If you are in full screen mode \u2014 like when you are giving a talk or watching a movie \u2014 it opens itself up in split view mode where it takes up half the screen while your other main window is being resized.\nI saw this happening first hand when coworkers showed me something on their computers but never experienced it myself. This has been happening since at least macOS 10.12.\nAfter some research it became clear that it\u2019s related to Gmail and I\u2019m not exactly the only one:\nThe proposed solutions are to disable Power Nap (I don\u2019t see how that could be related) or to remove Gmail. I wouldn\u2019t call any of these a viable solution.\nUnfortunately now I\u2019m also in the select group of people experiencing this bug.\nI tried to confirm the theory of Gmail causing it and could partially reproduce it. The bug only seems to happen with Gmail accounts that are part of a G Suite account and not with my personal Gmail account. It happens 1-2 times per day.\nFunnily enough the bug only started to show up when I got my new Mac Mini with a clean install of Catalina. This makes it pretty clear that this is not some third party app causing havoc but just yet another critical bug that hasn\u2019t been resolved in an increasingly longer list of macOS releases. It\u2019s not as critical as Mail.app deleting emails but it\u2019s still not something you want to have happening every few hours.",

        "body": "Apple's upcoming \"iPhone 12\" may not come with EarPods included in the box, as a means of driving demand for the company's popular wireless AirPods which are sold separately, according to reputable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nApple has included earbuds with the iPhone ever since the first model of the smartphone launched in 2007, in large part because the \u200ciPhone\u200c was pitched as a natural extension of the iPod \u2013 a music player that also made phone calls.\nHowever, in a TF International Securities research note issued to investors today and seen by MacRumors, Kuo said he expects Apple to leave out the traditional wired earphones that come with iPhones, which will usher in strong demand for AirPods shipments this year.\nIn addition to the need for new \u200ciPhone\u200c users to supply their own earphones, Kuo expects an uptick in AirPods shipments to be driven by an end to AirPods inventory depletion by the second half of the year, coupled with the likelihood that Apple will offer a special AirPods promotion in late 2020.\nIn terms of this year, Kuo said that AirPods shipments are likely to be at their lowest ebb in the second quarter due to the impact of the global health crisis, with total shipments declining by 29 percent from the previous quarter to 17.2 million.\nHowever, AirPods shipments will benefit from increasing demand beginning in the third quarter, coupled with continuing strong demand for AirPods Pro throughout the year buoyed by Apple's expected promotional offer in the second half of 2020. Overall, Kuo predicts shipments to grow from his original estimate of 80-90 million pairs to 93.8 million pairs.\nIn a previous note to investors, Kuo said Apple is working on third-generation AirPods that will go into mass production during the first half of 2021, although this new model will only have internal changes and there won't be a change in external design.\nThis information goes against rumors of an \u200cAirPods\u200c update coming in 2020, and Kuo suggests no new \u200cAirPods\u200c are coming until 2021. By contrast, leaker Jon Prosser recently said that third-generation \u200cAirPods\u200c are ready to launch anytime.\nKuo acknowledges that the market is expecting a new \u200cAirPods\u200c model in the second half of 2020, but he thinks this is more likely to be a new set of Beats instead of a new set of \u200cAirPods\u200c, meaning \"\u200c\u200cAirPods Pro\u200c\u200c Lite\" rumors are actually referencing new headphones in the Beats lineup.",

Apple has released special Pride bands for the last couple of years, but this is the first time Nike has also joined in with the celebrations.\nThe new bands are available to order today from the Apple Store. The bands match new watch faces coming in watchOS 6.2.5, which we reported over the weekend.\nApple announced the new watch bands as part of a press release that highlights how this year\u2019s LGBTQ Pride month has had to change in the light of the global coronavirus pandemic.\nIn normal years, communities celebrate Pride with festivals and parades. In fact, the first Apple Watch Pride band was gifted to Apple employees in 2016 as part of Apple\u2019s official Pride March. At least for this year, events are instead taking place over the Internet.\nApple and Nike are supporting LGBTQ organizations including GLSEN, PFLAG, The Trevor Project, Gender Spectrum, The National Center for Transgender Equality, and ILGA World.\nNew Pride watch faces in watchOS 6.2.5\nThe new bands will look great when paired with the new software watch faces which will be released as part of watchOS 6.2.5. Apple is adding a 2020 variant of the Pride face to continue the design of the Pride Sport Band onto the Watch\u2019s display. There are also new rainbow color options for several faces, including the exclusive Nike faces.\nWith the introduction of the 2020 Pride Edition Sport bands, Apple has discontinued the 2019 Pride Edition Sport Loop band. As for the new entry, Apple describes the process of creating the new multicolored version from multiple strips:\nThe Pride Edition Sport Band is assembled by hand from individual strips of colored fluoroelastomer. The strips are then machine die-cut and compression molded together. This process results in subtle variations in the wavy rainbow design, making each band artfully unique.\nFind the new $49 Pride Edition bands exclusively from Apple:",

        "title": "The 10nm Intel Ice Lake CPUs found in the new 13-inch MacBook Pro are currently exclusive to Apple",
        "body": "The new 10th-generation quad-core CPUs found in the new MacBook Pro 13-inch appear to be exclusive to Apple, at least at this point in time. A search of the Intel Ark does not reveal any Ice Lake parts that match up with the silicon Apple is offering in its latest laptop which are much more powerful.\n4 Reviews\nApple has been known to get custom parts from Intel in the past as well as early access and it looks like that might also be the case for the new 13-inch MacBook Pro models too. Although Apple continues to offer 8th-generation parts at lower price points in the new Magic Keyboard-based line up, the latest 10th-generation parts it is also offering are still not listed on Intel\u2019s Ark of Ice Lake parts despite Apple's recent product launch. It would seem then, at least for the time being, Apple has exclusive access to this silicon from Intel although it has previously revealed these parts will be hitting the market around this time.\nThe current top of the line Ice Lake part listed on Intel\u2019s website is a Core i7-1065G7 quad-core 15 W part (configurable up to 25 W) chip with a base frequency of just 1.3 GHz with boost to 3.9 GHz. Even the Core i5-1038G7 (28 W) part available for the new 13-inch MacBook Pro has a base clock of 2.0 GHz and can boost to 3.8 GHz. The new Core i7-1068G7 (28 W) part has a base clock of 2.3 GHz and can boost to 4.1 GHz making both chips the highest performing Ice Lake parts currently found in any notebook by some margin.\nApple\u2019s exclusivity on the two parts could be relatively lengthy given Intel\u2019s well-documented woes with its 10nm node. Given that mass quantities of the 10th-generation parts available to other OEMs are currently capped at a based clock speed of just 1.3 GHz, it suggests that Intel may not yet have sufficient yields of the higher-performing chips to offer more widely. However, now that Apple has shipped the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the new Ice Lake parts, it will be interesting to see how long it takes for other makers to release notebooks with the new parts as well.",

        "title": "AirPods have dominated television quarantine era",
        "body": "Shark Tank. The Weather Report. Tiger King. Disney Sing-Along. Community. These five things, and countless others, have one very clear thing in common while we're all stuck in separate rooms. In each of these television events, the people staring into the camera and laughing, singing, or talking at you about something are all wearing Apple's AirPods. It's the best advertising Apple never asked for, but makes a crystal clear statement about the state of the headphone market.\nThis is Apple's world now, and everything else is just taking up space on the shelf at the electronics shop.\nAirPods Pro Check Amazon $249 at Apple\nBottom line: Finally, a comfortable pair of AirPods with active noise-canceling. What more could you ask for?\nIt doesn't matter if they're the OG Airpods or the newer AirPods Pro, Apple's True Wireless earbuds are clearly the headset of choice in our quarantined world. Netflix producers shipped an iPhone and a pair of AirPods to everyone involved in the bonus episode of Tiger King, and they did this because these heaphones are dead simple to use and it created a base line of audio quality for the editors to work with. Everyone had the same quality audio and video, which makes editing any project easier. This little bit of recording magic has been repeated all over the place, just send out a little care package with a tripod and a phone and some headphones with some quick instructions on how to set everything up. Pow, instant basic TV-ready experience.\nAirPods were already a status symbol, and now they're in our faces on a scale no other set of headphones could possible compete with.\nAnd, ultimately, that's why these are on television all the time right now. AirPods are not the best heaphones in the world, nor do they have the best microphones built in. You can get cheaper heaphones from Amazon, Google, or a dozen other companies right now. But it doesn't matter, because none of them are as straightforward and easy to use as AirPods. And as we've seen from Apple's Greg Joswiak, the popularity was already too much for Apple to handle. Most folks in television are going to own iPhones anyway, so the choice is obvious. Open the lid, stick them in your ears, and AirPods immediately start working. Couldn't be more simple, and there's a good chance a lot of the folks working in television already have these headphones to begin with.\nThe long term implications of this are genuinely fascinating to think about. Right now, millions of people are watching celebrities and TV hosts and their favorite actors all do things on television with Apple hardware in their ears. Even though it's never directly called out, the headphones are suddenly as ubiquitous as the old iPhone ad campaign with the shadow people rocking the wired Earpod headphones. AirPods were already a status symbol, and now they're in our faces on a scale no other set of headphones could possible compete with. And if what they say about the AirPod supply chain rebounding is true, Apple's about to have an incredibly successful summer in the headphone department.",

        "title": "Leaker: Apple to Launch New Low-Cost iPad This Year With A12 Chip",
        "body": "Apple's eighth-generation iPad will arrive this year and feature an A12 chip, according to an anonymous Twitter account with a thus-far proven track record for forthcoming Apple product leaks.\nApple's seventh-generation \u200ciPad\u200c, introduced in September 2019, was an iterative update to the sixth-generation low-cost \u200ciPad\u200c, with a larger 10.2-inch display and support for new accessories. However, it used the same A10 Fusion chip as the sixth-generation \u200ciPad\u200c.\nOn Thursday, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that Apple is working on two new \u200ciPad\u200c models, which include a 10.8-inch \u200c\u200ciPad\u200c\u200c and an 8.5 to 9-inch \u200c\u200ciPad\u200c\u200c mini. These new iPads are expected to launch in the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021, respectively.\nKuo said that he believes the two new \u200c\u200ciPad\u200c\u200c models will follow the \u200ciPhone SE\u200c's product strategy, which means affordable price points. The existing low-cost \u200c\u200ciPad\u200c\u200c is 10.2 inches, so it's not clear if Apple plans to introduce larger-sized tablets or increase the available display size through bezel reduction.\nin my dream iPad 2020 A12 \u2014 \u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u641e\u63aa (@L0vetodream) May 15, 2020\nRumors aside, it would be reasonable to expect a new entry-level \u200ciPad\u200c this year, as the device has been updated annually for the past three generations. Also, the A10 chip was first used in the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, so there's a good case for arguing that it's about time Apple took the processing power up a notch in its most affordable \u200ciPad\u200c. The A12 chip first appeared in the \u200ciPhone\u200c XS, XS Max, XR and the 2019 versions of the iPad Air and \u200ciPad\u200c Mini.\nIn recent weeks, the anonymously-run Twitter account \"L0vetodream\" has noted that some products and components have been delayed, including the new iMac models and the A14 chip. It has also hinted at a 2021 release for a rumored 14-inch MacBook Pro.\nThe Twitter account accurately revealed several details about the new \u200ciPhone SE\u200c before any other leakers that we know of, including that the device would launch in the second week of April and come in three storage capacities. Likewise, the account accurately claimed that new iPad Pro models would launch in the third week of March.",
