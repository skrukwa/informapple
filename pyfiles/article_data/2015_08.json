        "title": "Almost half of Apple Music subscribers have stopped listening",
        "body": "According to a survey published today, 48 percent of Apple Music listeners polled say they have given up listening to the streaming music \u2014 and the free trial isn\u2019t even over yet.\nMeanwhile, 61 percent claim they have disabled the auto-renewal option on their accounts so as not to be charged when the trial period ends in September.\nThe survey was carried out by MusicWatch, which interviewed 5,000 U.S. customers aged 13 and older. That\u2019s a tiny fraction of the 11 million users who have signed up for Apple Music, but if the survey results are indicative of a larger trend, it\u2019s less than good news for Apple.\nApple disputes the numbers, telling The Verge that \u201c79 percent of users who have signed up for Apple Music are still using the service.\u201d\nMusicWatch managing partner Russ Crupnick puts the lack of adoption down to \u201cthe disadvantage of not being the first mover in a market where very good service currently exist\u201d \u2014 referring to Apple Music rivals like Spotify.\nInterestingly, only 30 percent of Apple Music users listen to Beats 1, while 27 percent use Connect.\nSince these are both areas where Spotify can\u2019t compete with Apple Music, it seems that Apple could do better to highlight these services. Fortunately, that\u2019s exactly what seems to be happening. Apple\u2019s latest Apple Music ads and the company\u2019s statements concerning the Apple Music Festival both focus heavily on Apple Music\u2019s Connect feature.\nThe MusicWatch survey also suggests Apple Music has attracted 28 percent of Spotify\u2019s paying customers, showing the new service is certainly appealing to people who are already used to paying for streaming music.\nWhat\u2019s most important now is advertising Apple Music and what it does better than anyone else. Fortunately for Apple, that\u2019s one place where the company excels.\nSource: New York Post\nThis story has been updated to add Apple\u2019s response to the survey results.",

        "title": "\"Apple is working on behalf of its paying customers. This is huge. There isn\u2019t a customer on Earth who wants to be tracked like an animal without clear and explicit permission, or to have pages slowed by tracking cookies, beacons and ads fed by distant servers. Especially on mobile.\"",
        "body": "The tide of popular sentiment is turning against tracking-based advertising \u2014 and Apple knows it. That\u2019s why they\u2019re enabling \u201ccontent blocking\u201d in iOS 9 (the new mobile operating system that will soon go in your iPhone and iPad).\nSays Apple, \u201cContent Blocking* gives your extensions a fast and efficient way to block cookies, images, resources, pop-ups, and other content.\u201d\nThis is aimed straight at tracking-based advertising, known in the trade as adtech.* And Apple isn\u2019t alone:\n[*Note: far I know, there was not a term for tracking-based advertising until adtech seemed to emerge as the front-runner. I chose it for this post because others (e.g. the first two examples above) have done the same. Tell me a better word and I\u2019ll swap it in. And if you want to know why we need to distinguish between advertising based on tracking people and advertising that is not, read my last post, Separating Advertising\u2019s Wheat and Chaff.]\nHere\u2019s Apple\u2019s tech-speak on the feature:\nYour app extension is responsible for supplying a JSON file to Safari. The JSON consists of an array of rules (triggers and actions) for blocking specific content. Safari converts the JSON to bytecode, which it applies efficiently to all resource loads without leaking information about the user\u2019s browsing back to the app extension.\nThis means the iOS platform will now support developers who want to build sophisticated apps that give users ways to block stuff they don\u2019t like, such as adtech tracking and various forms of advertising \u2014 or all advertising \u2014 and to do it privately.\nThis allows much more control over unwanted content than is provided currently by ad and tracking blockers on Web browsers, and supports this control at the system level, rather than at the browser level. (Though it is executed by the browser.)\nHow likely is it that these apps will be built? 100%. One of those is Crystal, by Dean Murphy. His pitches:\nRemove advert banners, blocks, popovers, autoplay videos, App Store redirects & invisible tracking scripts that follow you around the web. Pages render more than 3.9x faster on average**. Reduces data use by 53% on average**.\n[**Benchmarks calculated from a selection of random pages from 10 popular sites.]\nAll three of these address obvious appetites by customers in the marketplace:\nTo avoid ads, and being tracked. To speed things up. To minimize data usage, for which mobile carriers charge money.\nIn iOS 9 content blocking will transform the mobile Web: I\u2019ve tried it., Owen Williams (@ow) of TheNextWeb gives Crystal a spin, finding it delivers on its promises.\nIf I read Owen right, he believes Content Blocking will have two results:\nPublishers will lose, because they depend on advertising that will be blocked; and Apple will win, because publishers will be driven to the company\u2019s News app, on which Apple can make money with its own advertising system, called iAd. [Since then discontinued. See the note at the end of this piece.]\nWhile these assumptions might be correct, they are part of a much larger picture, which will surely change as content blockers such as Crystal get adopted. So let\u2019s look at that picture.\nThis is why content blocking is chemo for the cancer of adtech. It is also why everybody involved in the advertising-funded online ecosystem should start separating the wheat from the chaff, and to make clear that the wheat \u2014 plain old non-tracking-based brand advertising \u2014 is (to mix metaphors) the baby in the advertising bathwater that users will start throwing out with their content blockers.\nHowever it goes down, the inevitable results, long term, will be these:\nBrand advertising (the non-tracking-based kind) will be seen again as the most legitimate form of advertising. Brand advertising will again be credited for doing the good work of funding publishers (also broadcasters, podcasters and the rest). Adtech, and spying in general, will be shunned, as it deserves to be. Adtech will still live on, rehabilitated and cleansed, as a trusted symbiote of users who give clear and unambiguous permission for trackers they bless to dwell in their private spaces and give them optimal personalized advertising experiences.\nIn other words, what I said at the close of the Advertising Bubble chapter of The Intention Economy will come true:\nWhen the backlash is over, and the advertising bubble deflates, advertising will remain an enormous and useful business. We will still need advertising to do what only it can do. What will emerge, however, is a market for what advertising can\u2019t do. This new market will be defined by what customers actually want, rather than guesses about it.\n* As a term, \u201ccontent blocking\u201d is an unfortunate choice, since until now it meant government censorship. But the deed is done. From this point forward it means you get to block stuff you don\u2019t want happening on your mobile device.\nLater (2:36pm) \u2014 So I tweeted this post here, not long after it went up, and the response is split between yea and nay (though mostly yea). Since I have no argument with the yeas, I\u2019ll take on the nays\u2026\n@cpokane writes,\nit is offensive to us who work in adtech by day and nurse the result of cancer by night, at home. disappointing metaphor.\nGareth Holmes (@mgrholmes) adds these:\nNo offence to @dsearls but comparing ad tech to cancer is beyond hyperbole. FACT: ad tech has been keeping the internet free since 1993 @cpokane having never met @dsearls I only hope he doesn\u2019t have to wait until he\u2019s lying next to a dying loved one to realise he was wrong.\nAnd Vlad Stein (@vstein) weighs in with this:\n@dsearls Couldn\u2019t imagine a stupider, more offensive title. Ad tech is what makes free online content viable, like it or not.\nNo offence taken. Or meant to be given. Cancer is a common metaphor for many things that are not. So is chemo: a medicine that sickens a patient while killing (or at least trying to kill) his or her cancer. Tell me a better metaphor and I\u2019ll gladly use it. (I have also experienced loved ones dying of cancer, and I\u2019m not sure they would have disapproved of the metaphor.)\nAs for hyperbole, guilty as charged. I\u2019m making a strong point here, and one almost nobody else (other than Don Marti and Bob Hoffman) is making \u2014 or has seen sunk in. The market sentiment against surveillance-based marketing \u2014 aka adtech \u2014 is strong, growing, and almost entirely ignored by the whole adtech business.\nAs for Apple\u2019s nature as a company, they are hardly pure. In fact, there is a vast inconsistency between what they\u2019re doing on the B2C side with Content Blocking and on the B2B side with adtech.\nOn the B2C side, which is 99+% of what Apple does, the company works on behalf of its paying customers. This is huge, because there isn\u2019t a customer on Earth who wants to be tracked like an animal without clear and explicit permission, or to have pages slowed by tracking cookies, beacons and ads fed by unknown and unwelcome servers. Especially on mobile. Apple knows this because they talk on the phone and in stores every day with those customers. They\u2019ve also seen abundant research (some cited above) that makes clear how much people hate having their privacy violated, which Adtech does with abundant impunity. Meanwhile adtech doesn\u2019t talk to those customers. It only follows them. Ain\u2019t the same.\nOn the B2B side, Apple with iAd has been in the adtech business from the start, in 2010. (I visit all this in my next post.) While they don\u2019t allow third party cookies or tracking, they do allow advertisers to aim their ads based on what Apple knows about you from your iTunes and App Store purchases, plus other intelligence the company gathers from its interactions with you. This is adtech, pure and simple.\nSo yes, Apple is having it both ways.\nI suspect Apple will reconcile the two by pushing non-tracking-based brand ads for higher prices. If they do that, both publishers and brands will appreciate the lack of reader confusion about the provenance and motives of those ads. But I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see.\nNext, saying adtech (or anything) has kept the Net free is like saying coupon flyers have kept geology free. The Net was born free and remains that way. Same goes for the Web. They support an infinite variety of sites, services and activities, and not just commercial ones. (More about that here, here and here.)\nIn fact, commercial activity was impossible on the Internet before NSFnet (the one non-commercial network within the Internet) stood down on 30 April 1995. After that ecommerce took off. (Amazon and eBay were both born in \u201995.) So did advertising, but not as fast. Adtech (or ad tech) didn\u2019t take off until well after the turn of the millennium.\nThis blog has been free and viable since 1998, by the way, without an ounce of advertising. So has everything Dave Winer\u2018s done. Without Dave we wouldn\u2019t have blogging, syndicating (e.g. RSS) or podcasting as we know it.\nSomething worth thinking about: if we had jobbed out inventing and developing the Net and the Web to commercial interests, would they even exist?\n@Ertraeglichkeit writes,\n@dsearls what did the NSFnet bring, that it started \u201ccommercial activity\u201d on the net and say not hotwired in 1994 with ad banners?\nThe Internet is a collection of networks united by agreements called protocols. Those protocols said data should be passed between any one end and any other end over any path available, on a best effort basis. This means the data you send to me could go over any path on any network between us on the whole thing called the Internet. This also meant that if any one network forbid one kind of activity, it would do for the whole internetwork. Because the NSFnet (National Science Foundation Network) forbid commercial activity on itself, and the NSFnet was a member of the Internet, it forbid commercial activity for the whole thing. So, when the NSFnet went down on 30 April, 1995, it opened the whole Internet to commercial activity. That\u2019s a short version. If you\u2019re interested in learning more, I recommend Wikipedia\u2019s article on the NSFnet.\n[August 27] Bonus link from Bob Hoffman, the Ad Contrarian (and a hero of all-wheat advertising): Is Our Long Digital Nightmare Coming To An End? Writes he,\nI can think of nothing that has done more harm to the internet than adtech. It is a plague. It interferes with virtually everything we try to do on the web. It has cheapened and debased advertising. It has helped spawn criminal empires. It is in part responsible for unprecedented fraud and corruption. It has turned marketing executives into clueless baboons. And it is destroying the idea of privacy, one of the backbones of democracy. And for what? 8 clicks in 10,000 impressions? But maybe there is hope for those of us who hate adtech.\nSure hope I\u2019m right.\n[Later (15 January 2016)\u2026] Apple let develpers know that iAd will be discontinued.",

        "title": "iOS 9 content blocking will transform the mobile Web: I\u2019ve tried it",
        "body": "iOS 9 comes with a major new feature called \u2018content blockers\u2019 which will allow users to install apps that block trackers, advertisements and other unwanted content for the first time.\nMuch has been written about the impending threat of ad blocking on iOS \u2014 it\u2019s the first time blocking mobile advertisements en masse will be possible and publishers may face an existential threat to their revenue streams.\nHow content blockers work\nContent blockers on iOS 9 are a new type of app that\u2019s able to block incoming content before it\u2019s loaded by the system \u2014 it provides a list of sites and scripts to the operating system for blocking. Instead of requiring the browser to process what to block as the page loads, it\u2019s performed on a system level before the page loads which increases speed significantly.\nMany websites utilize so-called \u2018third-party trackers\u2019 to enable advertising, analytics and other marketing tools to show visitors advertisements.\nThese tools gather information as you browse the internet to try and show you ads that are relevant to your habits, but often add extra weight that slows down site performance dramatically, increasing load times and causing the browser to sometimes become unstable.\nI\u2019ve been skeptical about content blockers on iOS; I don\u2019t block advertisements on desktop, since I find the browser to be fast enough for it to not be necessary. I do block trackers, because I worry about the information such networks are gathering on me.\nMobile Safari, however, is another story. It can feel slow, bulky and unstable at times as it tries to handle the ever-growing piles of cruft that sites pile on to try and show relevant advertising.\nOver the last few days I\u2019ve been testing an experimental content blocker called Crystal, which promises to speed up browsing on iOS. I\u2019ve been particularly impressed by the results and taken aback by how much removing trackers, ads and other scripts makes a difference over a cellular connection.\nHow Crystal affects page load times in iOS 9\nThe creator of the app published impressive stats on how using the app saves not only a large amount of data, but a lot of time waiting around for pages to load. The numbers paint a stark picture, but I wanted to illustrate just how big the impact of this is in the real world.\nLEFT: No content blocker. RIGHT: Crystal enabled.\nThe test\nTo test content blockers, I decided to pit Crystal \u2014 which is in a very early state of development \u2014 against major news sites online. Much noise has been made in the past few weeks about how slow and heavy some sites have become, so I wanted to take a look at how much difference iOS ad blocking could truly make.\nFor each test, I loaded sites over a 4G LTE connection in Safari (the WiFi icon appears due to Quicktime\u2019s recording mode, which also hides the network name and emulates a full battery).\nThe first page load was always with Crystal disabled (pictured left), then followed by a test with it turned on (pictured right). Between each page load I cleared Safari\u2019s cache and cookies, restarted Safari and then enabled or disabled the content blocker, to ensure consistent results.\nThe effect of using a content blocker on iOS is, to be honest, something publishers should be deeply afraid of. I don\u2019t really care about advertising actually appearing on sites, I just care about how fast the site itself loads over a constrained connection.\nBloomberg and iMore are some of the worst offenders \u2014 both sites have almost finished loading entirely with Crystal enabled, before the page with advertising even shows on the screen.\niMore was the target of a post last month complaining about how slow the site had become and the site\u2019s Editor in Chief, Rene Ritchie, responded saying that it was working to improve the situation.\nOther sites such as The Next Web and The Verge show a smaller, but still significant difference in load times.\nTesting content blockers with The Verge\nTesting content blockers with iMore\nOn the BBC\u2019s website, blocking didn\u2019t help the site render much faster, but instead stopped long loading times that continue after the site first appears on the screen.\nIn the demonstration below, the BBC continues loading when ads are enabled long after it first shows on the screen, which affects Safari\u2019s performance until it completes.\nTesting content blockers with BBC\nSome publications \u2014 predominantly those with the most money \u2014 are doing better than others, however. Both the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times showed impressive speed with only a negligible difference in page loading times with content blocking enabled.\nTesting content blockers on the New York Times\nTesting content blockers on the Wall Street Journal\nContent blockers do more than just improve Safari\u2019s general performance, they also affect the new iOS 9 web view, which can be used in many third-party apps, like Twitter and Facebook, making external links faster to load.\nYear over year, ad blocking continues to gain popularity on the desktop Web. One study from Pagefair \u2014 a company that sells tools to fight ad blocking \u2014 said that in 2015 ad blocking grew by 41 percent in the last year alone to over 198 million active users.\nThat\u2019s a big number, but only small slice of the pie. Ad blocking on mobile has far more clear benefits to the user than on desktop \u2014 better battery life, fewer crashes, lowered data usage and protection against App Store exploits are among some of the benefits directly noticeable to the user.\nAll it\u2019ll take for ad blocking to gain prominence on iOS is a stint at the top of the \u2018popular apps\u2019 charts. It\u2019s hard to argue against an app that improves battery life and system stability by removing annoying ads.\nWin-win for Apple\nWe still don\u2019t know what Apple will actually permit on the App Store. It has remained tight-lipped about the policies it will implement for content blocking.\nAs such apps can automatically update their list of what\u2019s blocked outside of the App Store, it\u2019ll be interesting to see if Apple will allow full-blown ad blockers like Crystal or only simpler tracking blockers such as Disconnect.\nIt\u2019s likely Apple will allow full-blown content blockers as it\u2019s got skin in the game \u2014 it stands to directly benefit from hurting publishers.\nBlocking ads on the Web means it\u2019ll force publishers toward the \u2018News\u2019 app which also happens to be included in iOS 9, where it\u2019s not possible to block ads and Apple gets a cut of money made from advertising shown via its iAd network.\nThose publishers that choose not to be a part of News will be forced to build their own native apps to circumvent ad blocking, which again, will take advantage of the iAd network to monetize content.\nFor Apple, it\u2019s a win-win situation where it can\u2019t really lose. If users block ads, their iPhones will be faster and more stable and publishers will be driven toward platforms where Apple can take a cut of the cash.\nWhat\u2019s clear to me is that ad blocking offers serious, clear advantages to those using iPhones that could create a serious threat for publishers\u2019 ad revenue on mobile, but it\u2019s probably a good thing.\nFor years they\u2019ve been piling on script after script with little afterthought for those on mobile \u2014 ad blocking might finally present them with a reason to care more and work to improve the performance of their sites and offer better alternatives to heavy, slow advertising.\nContent blocking is a part of Apple\u2019s upcoming iOS 9 release and Crystal is currently in private testing.",

        "body": "As predicted in August, Apple is planning to hold a media event on Wednesday, September 9 at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California. Media invites were sent out today, with Yahoo's Alyssa Bereznak sharing the first look at the artwork and tagline for the invitations: \"Hey Siri, give us a hint.\"\nThis year's iPhone-centric event is expected to see the debut of the next-generation iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, which, according to rumors, will include a reinforced body constructed from stronger 7000 Series aluminum, Force Touch, an A9 processor, 2GB RAM, and an improved camera.\nRumors have also suggested Apple will use the event to unveil the next-generation Apple TV, a major update from the existing set-top box. It will include a redesigned chassis with an A8 processor, more storage space, and a touch-based remote control, along with a new software system that includes Siri support and a full App Store.\nWe'll also get an update on the launch dates of iOS 9 and watchOS 2, and shortly after the event ends, we may see golden master software releases for the two software updates ahead of their final public launch.\nIn line with past events, the September 9 iPhone unveiling will begin at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Apple has not yet confirmed whether the event will be live streamed on its website and through the Apple TV, but it is likely details on a live stream will be announced a few days ahead of the event.\nUpdate: Siri itself is also getting in on the festivities with some witty responses.\nUpdate 2: Apple will be live streaming the media event on the web for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and PC users.",

        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nThe original developers of much maligned Mac security software MacKeeper have agreed to a $2 million settlement in a class action lawsuit over deceptive claims and false advertisement, with part of the sum set aside for customer refunds.\nUnder the proposed settlement, ZeoBIT, creators of MacKeeper that later sold the software to German firm Kromtech, will put up to $2 million in a fund to cover attorney fees, refunds and administrative costs, reports MacWorld. One-third is earmarked for lawyers, with a large chunk of the remainder to be meted out equally among claimants who purchased MacKeeper prior to July 8.\nIn all there some 513,000 U.S. customers in the settlement class, some of whom paid up to $39.95 per copy to license MacKeeper. Depending on the number of claims, customers could recoup original costs, but full refunds are not guaranteed. The company admits no fault as part of the settlement's terms.\nMacKeeper is notorious for aggressively advertising its software and services through online ad agencies, though its new parent firm Kromtech is supposedly abandoning such tactics and has made efforts to cut down on \"scare ads\" pushed by affiliates. The software's validity is also a subject of debate as tests have shown it to sometimes return false positives in system scans.",

        "body": "Apple hasn't yet officially announced its annual fall media event, but it's definitely planning one \u2014 and the date is fast approaching.\nSources familiar with Apple's plans tell BuzzFeed News the company intends to hold a special event the week of Sept. 7, with Wednesday the 9th being the most likely date. Sept. 9 is the same day on which Apple held this event last year.\nLike Apple fall events past, this one too will focus on the company's next-generation iPhones, which are expected to arrive at market with a pressure-sensitive Force Touch display, an improved camera system, and a significantly faster and power-efficient wireless chip. Sources say Apple executives are likely to show off the company's latest iPads at this event as well, though that 12.9-inch \"iPad Pro\" seems to be a wildcard, still.\nAlso expected to debut at this event is the long-awaited successor to Apple TV. As BuzzFeed News previously reported, Apple originally intended to unveil the new set-top box in June at its annual Word Wide Developers Conference, but scrapped that plan a few weeks prior to the event. Multiple sources familiar with Apple's plans say Apple TV is currently part of the company's fall event. That said, this is Apple we're talking about and with a month left to go before the event, plans can shift.\nAlmost certainly not part of this fall event: Apple's new subscription TV service. Sources say the company still hasn't finalized the content deals it feels are key to a successful go-to-market strategy.\nAs we've previously reported, Apple's next-generation Apple TV is a tactical overhaul of the dusty set-top box, which hasn't much changed since early 2012. Sources say the device will feature a refreshed and slimmer chassis and new innards, Apple's A8 system on chip, an increase in on-board storage, Homekit device integration and an improved operating system that will support Siri voice control. Expected alongside it, a new remote that sources say has been \"drastically improved\" by a touch-pad input and a long-in-the-offing App Store.\nAs I wrote back in March:\n\"If I'm understanding the company's strategy correctly, the new Apple TV isn't just a play for a stake of the streaming TV market, but for the mythical digital living room. Think TV, music, apps and a little bit of home automation as well.\"\nApple spokesperson Trudy Muller declined comment on the company's fall event plans.\nFurther Reading\nNew Apple TV Will Not Support 4K Video Streaming",

        "title": "iPhone 6S packaging suggests 16 GB base model will stay around for another product cycle",
        "body": "A purported photo of an iPhone 6S information sheet has surfaced detailing the specifications of the upcoming iPhone, due to be announced at an event on September 9th. Whilst the detailed technical specifications do not reveal anything new, the page header is intriguing. It suggests that, once again, Apple will offer a 16 GB base model version of the iPhone 6S (via Steve Hemmerstoffer). This matches analysis of iPhone 6S components obtained by 9to5Mac back in June, which showed Apple using 16 GB memory chips in preproduction units.\nLow storage space iPhone SKUs is a big complaint in the community. Many had thought this would be the year Apple finally drops 16 GB from the new lineup of phones for good. Although iOS 9 is more efficient regarding storage, features like 12-megapixel photos and 4K video recording generally require a lot more storage space. Some supplier reports have also said the new iPhone lineup will start at 32 GB.\nNaturally, this unsubstantiated photo should be taken with some degree of skepticism. It could have been faked or it could have been from early product packaging designs that were changed later in the cycle. That being said, we now believe the box leak from yesterday to be accurate giving a bit more weight to the reliability of Chinese snaps of iPhone 6S packaging (shown below).\nAlso note that the existence of a 16 GB model does not mean the lineup has to stay identical as the iPhone 6 generation with 16/64/128 GB tiers. There is a chance Apple could slide in a 32 GB option between the 16 GB and 64 GB price points as they have done with the new iPod touch. We would consider this unlikely, however.\nThe iPhone 6S will likely launch around mid-September following the unveiling on September 9th. 9to5Mac\u2019s exclusive report show the iPhone will feature a greatly improved camera, Force Touch functionality, come in a Rose Gold color variant and include animated wallpapers a la Apple Watch which is where the koi fish (shown on the box ) comes into play.",

        "title": "iTunes needs to be rebuilt from scratch, but not split into separate apps",
        "body": "For some reason, a popular opinion floating around the web these days is that splitting iTunes up into a bunch of separate apps that all do one individual task each would be a vast improvement on the current one-app-for-everything design. \u201cThey did it on iOS,\u201d the logic goes, \u201cso why not do it on the Mac as well?\u201d\nAfter pondering this suggestion for a while, I\u2019m fully convinced that doing so would that be an unnecessary over-complication of the entire ecosystem.\nLet\u2019s consider exactly what functions in iTunes could be broken out into separate applications. At the moment iTunes is used for listening to music and podcasts, watching music videos and movies, playing streaming radio, managing audiobooks, syncing iOS devices, making purchases from Apple\u2019s various digital stores (with the exception of iBooks), and downloading iTunes U content.\nSo in order to break up iTunes based on the iOS model (and assuming audiobooks get moved into the existing iBooks app), we\u2019d need to have several different apps:\nA Music app solely for managing songs and listening to Apple Music or Beats 1\nA separate Videos app that houses music videos, movies, and TV shows\nAn app dedicated to syncing media to an iOS device\nA separate iTunes Store for purchasing music and videos\nAn entirely different store for buying iOS apps\nAn iTunes U app for viewing that material (probably with an integrated store)\nA Podcasts app for subscribing and listening to podcasts\nThis model works on iOS because mobile applications have limited screen real estate, meaning each app needs to be focused on a single function. You can\u2019t cram an infinite number of icons in the tab bar at the bottom of the screen, so instead, you break out features and hide them behind different home screen icons.\nOn the Mac, this problem doesn\u2019t exist. We have much more screen space to work with, and the Mac\u2019s entire interface is designed for apps that are able to do many related tasks.\nAnother problem arises with some of apps dedicated to specific types of content. On iOS, music videos can now appear in the Music app as part of the Apple Music service, even though there\u2019s a separate Videos app where your purchased videos go. Do we break out music videos and movies into two separate apps? Do we put music videos entirely in the music app, and let Videos hold only movies and TV shows? Do we just call that the Movies app? Could a Movies app also store home videos exported from iMovie?\nBoth of these points lead to a similar conclusion: we should combine apps that serve related purposes. Music, videos, and movies could all be combined into one media manager. iTunes U and podcasts could be added there as well.\nSo now we\u2019ve reduced the above list to the following:\nA Media app for music, radio, videos, podcasts, and movies\nAn app dedicated to syncing media to an iOS device\nA separate iTunes Store for purchasing music and videos (and maybe podcasts?)\nAn entirely different store for buying iOS apps\nThe App Store can be combined into the iOS manager since that\u2019s the only app that can sync those apps to mobile products. This puts us at three apps:\nA media app for music, radio, videos, podcasts, and movies\nAn app dedicated to managing iOS devices and downloading mobile apps\nA separate iTunes Store for purchasing music and videos\nSo, three things: a media playback app, a media store, and a mobile media syncing app. A media playback app, a media store, and a mobile media syncing app. Are you getting it? These are not three separate apps. This is one app. And we are calling it \u201ciTunes.\u201d\nLike it or not, iTunes is one app because the all-in-one approach works. Right now you might think that you want three or four or seven separate apps for micromanaging every little aspect of your media collection. You might think you want your dock filled with half a dozen different icons for tasks that could easily be accomplished in one bundle.\nBut trust me: you don\u2019t want that. It\u2019s a bad idea. Soon you\u2019d be complaining that seven apps crash too often or take too long to do something instead of just one. You\u2019d wish you could get to your podcasts and music all at once. You\u2019d get annoyed at having to deal with it all.\nI\u2019m not saying iTunes is a great app. Like most of the software Apple has released in recent years, they\u2019ve dumbed down things that don\u2019t need to be dumbed down and made other things more complicated than they need to be. They\u2019ve released yet another buggy piece of software that gets harder and harder to deal with on a daily basis. This isn\u2019t new.\nApple is still building on a fifteen-year-old foundation that, quite frankly, needs to be completely obliterated and rebuilt. I\u2019m not denying that. I\u2019m just saying that when they rebuild, it would be advisable to keep everything in one package.\niTunes isn\u2019t a slow, buggy, pain to use because it does too much stuff. It\u2019s like that because it\u2019s built on old code that should have been put out to pasture five years ago. Taking the current functionality and breaking it into separate apps is just going to spread that pain around a little bit more.\nThe idea is just as ridiculous as Facebook forcing everyone to download a separate app simply to send messages while blocking access to the inbox from the main client\u2014a move that may have put Messenger at the #1 spot on the free app listings, but also earned it an average review of one star at the time.\nSo yes, nuke iTunes from orbit and start from scratch. Please, Apple, for the love of all that is good, build us a new, less-bloated, less-buggy, version of this app. While you\u2019re at it, perhaps reconsider basically everything about the interface and bring back the simplicity of older versions.\nJust don\u2019t overcomplicate everything by needlessly dragging OS X into the iOS world with separate apps for every single function.",

        "title": "Sprint's 'iPhone Forever' Program Ensures Customers Always Have the Newest iPhone",
        "body": "Sprint today introduced a new plan called \"iPhone Forever,\" which grants upgrade eligibility for the newest iPhone to any customer who doesn't have the most current version of Apple's flagship smartphone on their contract. The plan goes into effect today, and the company is opening the data plan to both new and old Sprint users, although the latter must have an upgrade eligible device to start using iPhone Forever.\n\u201cWe asked ourselves, \u2018What could we do that would move our customers forward with the latest and greatest technology every day?\u2019 said Marcelo Claure, Sprint CEO. \u201cWe decided: How awesome would it be if anytime customers don\u2019t have the latest iPhone, they are eligible to upgrade, and have it be as simple as handing us your existing iPhone and picking up a new one \u2013 all included in your monthly rate.\u201d\niPhone Forever lets customers get an iPhone for $22 a month, with the simple rule that anytime they don't have the latest iPhone on their plan, they are automatically eligible for an upgrade. Sprint is also discounting the service to $15 per month for any customer who trades in an existing smartphone, the catch being that the new phone purchased has to be a 16GB iPhone 6, and the monthly rate will increase back to the normal amount after their next upgrade.\nThe $15 promotion will last until December 31, 2015, and the company notes that iPhone Forever is available on \"any eligible Sprint rate plan.\" Sprint's announcement today follows a few week's worth of other carriers' detailing the introduction of their own brand new service plans for customers, no doubt all preparing for the next-generation iPhone launch sometime next month.",

        "title": "Android Wear smartwatches come to the iPhone",
        "body": "\u201cUm. Did something just happen with Sundar Pichai?\u201d I asked. \u201cWait, what?\u201d was the response. Oh, you know, he\u2019s your new CEO now . Shall we go on with the interview?\nIn a nondescript conference room at Google\u2019s headquarters a few weeks ago, I paired my iPhone to a smartwatch running Android for the first time. I was there to ask Jeff Chang, the lead product manager for Wear, how he\u2019d managed to get Android watches working with iOS and how much they could do with an iPhone. Then my first notification came in on my newly paired Huawei Watch and my carefully laid plans evaporated.\nThat\u2019s how it goes with smartwatches. They\u2019re meant to keep you from having to pull your phone out of your pocket. You\u2019re supposed to glance at the notifications and smile inwardly, knowing that you can ignore that ping and focus on who you\u2019re talking to. At their best, they do exactly that. At their worst, they derail a conversation. They\u2019re also still nascent. Very few people have had to bother grappling with the idea of notifications and computers on their wrists, because not all that many people are buying smartwatches. There\u2019s a real sense that everybody\u2019s waiting to see how things shake out, and I don\u2019t blame them. Smartwatches aren\u2019t really ready for everybody yet, not the way that smartphones are. But the smartphone comparison is apt: nothing drove innovation in that space faster than healthy competition between Apple and Google. If competition is what it takes to get smartwatches ready for the mainstream, even Apple Watch users should be glad about Android Wear coming to the iPhone.\nThat\u2019s right: beginning today, a select set of Android Wear smartwatches (and all future watches) will work with the iPhone. The app should be rolling out worldwide soon. It\u2019s been a long time coming \u2014 and it means that Google will be challenging the Apple Watch on its home turf. Those Android Wear watches will be both cheaper and more varied than the Apple Watch \u2014 just like Android itself. There\u2019s an important caveat, though: when paired to an iPhone, Android Wear watches can\u2019t do as much as the Apple Watch. Nor can they do as much as they can when paired to an Android phone. Right now, only three watches officially support the iPhone, two of which aren\u2019t even available for purchase yet: the Huawei Watch, the Asus ZenWatch 2, and the LG Watch Urbane. Chang says that Google isn\u2019t supporting older watches because it wants them to work right away, without software updates. \"In order to guarantee a good experience, where out of the box it will work immediately and you don't have to do any fancy footwork, that's why it has to be the newer watches,\" he says. But I suspect that the Android community will find ways around that limitation for older watches in relatively short order. Assuming you have a compatible watch, the set-up process with Android Wear on an iPhone is easy. Install the Android Wear app, pair the watch to the phone, and tap through some screens to set up some basic preferences. After that, you\u2019re basically done \u2014 though there are some deeper watch settings you can dig into. Let\u2019s just run down the feature set, though be warned that there are funny little details to know about with each of these bullet points. Your notifications from the iPhone are mirrored on Android Wear.\nYou get Google Now cards on the watch.\nThere are a bunch of different watch faces \u2014 including select third-party watch faces \u2014 that you can install and use.\nThere are a few native apps on the watch you can tap into, like Weather or a clever Translate app.\nVoice search works, including various reminders that you might want to send to Google Now.\nYou can do fitness tracking on the watch with Google Fit.\nYou can get rich notifications from a small set of Google apps, such as Calendar and Gmail.\nThat\u2019s quite a lot, actually, and much more than I expected Google to pull off. The problem is that there are restrictions in iOS that prevent certain things from working. It\u2019s easy (and partially true) to rail against the locked-down nature of the iPhone, but in our conversations, everybody at Google demurred from wishing they could do more. Instead, Google just worked with the tools that Apple makes available over Bluetooth \u2014 and they turn out to be quite powerful. Chang says that \"Basically, like any other iOS developer, we work with Apple to make sure we understand and abide by their guidelines, what the policies for the apps are. That's what we're doing, and we'll continue to do that as we make updates to the app in the future.\" And actually, there is apparently one restriction that Apple has backed off on: allowing apps to refer to Android in the first place. In the past, the powers-that-be in Apple\u2019s App Store have rejected apps merely for noting they also exist on Android and even for declaring they support the Pebble smartwatch. How and why Android Wear\u2019s app became exempt from those restrictions is another question Google declined to answer. Android Wear does more (and less) than you'd expect Apple also doesn\u2019t allow competing app stores on the iPhone, nor is it likely that third-party app makers will be able to easily bake in more advanced support for Android Wear. That means that Google doesn\u2019t (at least for now) offer third-party watch apps for iPhone users. It also means that the selection of third-party watch faces you can get are \"curated\" by Google and probably won\u2019t offer the same advanced features you can get when you use Android Wear with an Android phone. Even with all those limitations, Google has managed to make Android Wear feel very nearly feature-complete, at least by the standards of what most people use smartwatches for. Getting those ambient Google Now notifications is great, and I was weirdly pleased to be able to swipe away notifications on the watch and know the same was happening on the iPhone. If only Apple would make swipe-to-dismiss as easy on its phone. Like the Pebble, Android Wear only receives the notifications that you have set to appear on your lock screen.\nGoogle\u2019s curated set of third-party watch faces probably has enough choices that you\u2019ll find something you\u2019ll like. Unfortunately, since it can\u2019t do full-fledged third-party apps, many of the best Android Wear watch faces aren\u2019t going to be available. But there are some good ones in there, including a pack from ustwo that I really like. Everything on Android Wear works thanks to the Android Wear app on the iPhone \u2014 you don\u2019t need to install Google Search or any other Google apps to use it. Voice search on the watch works really well, though if you tap the button that opens your results on the phone, you run into a weird situation. Since it has to work with the Android Wear app, you end up in an in-app browser inside that app. It\u2019s not terrible, just strange. By speaking to your watch, you can set Google Now reminders, open the Weather app, set timers, and more. All of it is as good or better than Siri. You can also use the watch to control your music, but you can\u2019t search for a specific song in Apple Music the way that Siri can. Voice search is accurate but limited The inability to communicate with other apps extends to other kinds of notifications, too. The most annoying is that you can\u2019t reply to any incoming texts from your watch. You can reply to emails from Gmail, but everything else just shows you the incoming message. You have to pull out your phone even just to reply with a quick \"Okay.\" But Android Wear does manage to offer some advanced features with Google apps. If you use Google Calendar or Gmail, you\u2019ll get more detailed notifications than you would with the default apps from Apple. And Google cleverly auto-blocks notifications from some duplicate apps when you set them up. In fact, you can swipe on any notification on your watch to get to \"block app,\" which is a scary term for a nice feature: it stops notifications from that app from hitting your watch. Sorry, Periscope (not really).",

        "body": "By Paul Lienert and Julia Love\nDETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Consumer electronics company Apple Inc has hired a senior engineer from electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc, according to a LinkedIn posting, as part of Apple's effort to build a team of experts in automated driving.\nA LinkedIn profile for Jamie Carlson shows that he has left Tesla and moved to Apple. At least six others with experience developing self-driving technology and systems have joined Apple, according to their LinkedIn profiles.\nAttempts to reach all seven people were unsuccessful and Apple declined to comment.\nSources have said that Apple is developing a car and studying self-driving technology, but it is unclear if the iPhone maker is designing a vehicle that could drive itself.\nSince January, Apple has hired Megan McClain, a former Volkswagen AG engineer with expertise in automated driving, and Vinay Palakkode, a graduate researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, a hub of automated driving research.\nIn August, Apple hired Xianqiao Tong, an engineer who developed computer vision software for driver assistance systems at microchip maker Nvidia Corp.\nThe Wall Street Journal has reported that Apple hired Paul Furgale, former deputy director of the Autonomous Systems Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, earlier this year.\nSo-called advanced driver assistance systems, or ADAS, handle tasks such as keeping a vehicle in a lane or driving by itself in stop-and-go traffic, and they are considered the building blocks for self-driving cars.\nAccording to Carlson's LinkedIn profile, he joined Apple in August in an unnamed position in a special projects group.\nThrough July, Carlson was an engineer on Tesla's Autopilot self-driving car program, and before that he worked on automotive vision systems for Michigan-based supplier Gentex Corp.\nOther Apple hires since September 2014 with similar experience have worked at automakers BMW AG, Volkswagen and Ford Motor Co, automotive suppliers Delphi Automotive, Robert Bosch GmbH and TRW, now a part of ZF Friedrichshafen AG, according to their LinkedIn profiles.\nAmong those hired last fall were Sanjai Massey, an engineer with experience in developing connected and automated vehicles at Ford and several suppliers; Stefan Weber, a former Bosch engineer with experience in video-based driver assistance systems, and Lech Szumilas, a former Delphi research scientist with expertise in computer vision and object detection.\n(Editing by Peter Henderson and Matthew Lewis)",

PCWorld reports that Intel engineers have suggested the sixth-generation Core processors could launch in around \"two weeks,\" setting the stage for a possible announcement of new chips appropriate for Macs at the IFA Berlin trade show on September 4-9.\nSkylake processors will feature improved Iris Pro integrated graphics capable of driving up to three 4K monitors at 60Hz, whereas Haswell architecture could drive a single 4K monitor at 30Hz and Broadwell architecture could handle a single 4K monitor at 60Hz. Skylake will also have fixed-function support for 4K video processing in hardware and support for the latest APIs: DirectX 12, OpenCL 2 and OpenGL 4.4.\nIntel's six generations of processor graphics (Image: Ars Technica\nThat means Intel has dedicated transistors directly to the job of decoding and encoding 4K. In one demonstration showing playback of a 4K RAW video stream from a Canon video camera, playback was smooth using the Skylake graphics chip, while using just the CPU, it would constantly drop frames.\nPC World:\nSkylake architecture is also more power efficient thanks to a new power-saving feature called Speed Shift, which allows the CPU to intelligently adjust its power state for extended battery life. Skylake CPUs are also more efficient overall and feature eDRAM+, which can cache information, for increased performance.\nIn June, Intel introduced Thunderbolt 3 with a USB Type-C connector and support for USB 3.1, DisplayPort 1.2 and PCI Express 3.0. The new spec, rumored to launch alongside Intel's next-generation Skylake chips, is capable of driving up to two 4K external displays at 60Hz or a single 5K display at 60Hz running off a single cable.\nLast month, a leaked Intel slide deck revealed that Skylake processors will provide a 10%-20% CPU performance boost in single and multi-threaded applications, with lower power consumption, and 30% faster Intel HD integrated graphics performance on average compared to current-generation Broadwell processors. The improved energy efficiency will also result in up to 30% longer battery life.\nIntel's Skylake processors appropriate for the MacBook Air were also leaked last week.",

        "body": "BuzzFeed News has revealed that Apple will hold a special event the week of September 7th (with Wednesday the 9th being the likeliest date) to unveil its next-generation iPhones, presumably called the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus.\nAccording to sources briefed on Apple\u2019s plans, the company will dedicate a significant portion of the keynote to addressing what some within are describing as a \u201cquantum-leap\u201d in camera technology for the iPhone 6S/iPhone 6S Plus. With the substantially improved 12-megapixel camera sensors, Apple plans to not only surpass Samsung and LG\u2019s smartphone offerings, but also set its sights on the amateur DSLR market. The camera, according to these sources, is also capable of recording videos in 4K quality.\nThe Michael Report \u2013 along with other outlets \u2013 can confirm, after reviewing documentations sent to several carriers worldwide, that customers would be able to preorder the newly released iPhones on September 18th following the keynote. Customers living in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia and Hong Kong (among several other countries) who prefer to purchase the iPhones in-store will be able to do so starting September 25th.\nAmong other numerous improvements, the iPhone 6S/iPhone 6S Plus is expected to ship with a pressure-sensitive Force Touch display and an entirely new wireless chip, which is said to be significantly faster and much more power-efficient.\nApple is also expected to debut the next-generation Apple TV and iPad at the same event, although BuzzFeed News calls the unveiling of the much-anticipated 12.9-inch iPad Pro \u201ca wildcard\u201d.",

        "title": "John Gruber dismantles baseless TechCrunch piece",
        "body": "\u2018It May Seem Silly\u2019\nJon Evans, in a piece for AOL/TechCrunch headlined \u201cDon\u2019t Be Apple\u201d:\nThere is so much to admire about Apple. They make superb, beautiful products. Their amazing comeback story is unparalleled in corporate history. [\u2026] So why do I think they represent so much of what\u2019s wrong with the tech world? It\u2019s because they have, I think, an almost Shakespearean tragic flaw: their obsession with centralized corporate control of the devices they sell. [\u2026] What could go wrong? Well, let\u2019s get dystopically speculative for a moment. Can you remember some of the most hyperbolic overreactions to the fall of the World Trade Center, and how they were welcomed by large swathes of the American public? Can you imagine a future in which, following a similar tragedy, Apple rolls over and becomes a de facto arm of surveillance states? I sure can \u2014 and Apple\u2019s centralized-command-and-control ecosystem would make it worryingly easy to turn every iOS device into an eye and ear of the panopticon, more or less overnight.\nAt which point we\u2019d be forced to continue using these spyware Apple products because\u2026 ? And engineers at Apple would continue working for the company rather than resigning en masse because\u2026 ? And Apple would suffer no bad publicity for its cowardice because\u2026 ? Because: Tim Cook could surely flip a switch that would enable this surveillance without anyone noticing.\nThis advice is madness. Evans is recommending against using a platform that is secure and private today, from a company with a consistent decades-long track record in this regard, because in the future they might turn coat and become an accomplice of government mass surveillance, even though, if that came to pass, we could and would all just abandon the use of Apple products.\nYou can aim similar criticisms at Android, too, but they would miss the mark. Love it or hate it, Android is not near [sic] as centralized as iOS, and Google is not nearly as controlling as Apple. It\u2019s open-source, and major organizations can \u2014 and do \u2014 fork it to create their own independent versions.\nParts of Android are indeed open source \u2014 \u201cexcept for all the good parts\u201d.\nApple fights an ongoing war with iOS jailbreakers, claiming that their work is \u201cpotentially catastrophic\u201d; Google makes it especially easy to root Nexus devices. [\u2026]\nGlenn Fleishman, writing for Macworld last month, \u201cHacking Team Hack Reveals Why You Shouldn\u2019t Jailbreak Your iPhone\u201d:\nA massive breach in the private data of a firm that sells software to governments to spy on communications shows that jailbroken iPhones are vulnerable. [\u2026] Two security outfits \u2014 the commercial Kaspersky Lab in Russia and academic Citizen Lab in Canada \u2014 first revealed in June 2014 that they had discovered and decoded Hacking Team\u2019s smartphone-cracking software. The reports at that time indicated that only jailbroken iOS devices could be hijacked, but that malware could be installed on an iOS device when connected to a computer that was confirmed as trusted, and which had been compromised. That external analysis has now been complemented by the Hacking Team\u2019s internal documents. One price list shows a \u20ac50,000 ($56,000) price tag on an iOS snooping module with the note, \u201cPrerequisite: the iOS device must be jailbroken.\u201d\nApple works to close jailbreaking exploits because they are potentially catastrophic.\nBack to Evans:\nIt may seem silly to criticize a fantastic company that makes superb products and delights its users on the basis of an abstract philosophical dispute.\nEven the most jacktastic article usually has one true sentence.\nBut I have a sneaking suspicion that over the next year this dispute will grow more and more concrete. Maybe, as this contrast heightens, Apple will see the light; maybe instead of fighting jailbreakers, they will offer jailbreaking and sideloading as an option for power users out of the box, just as Android does. That alone would be a huge seismic shift. But I\u2019m not holding my breath. And until and unless that happens, I find it hard to recommend the iOS ecosystem in good conscience, despite its power and beauty, because Apple refuses to return any of the trust it demands from its users.\nSo let\u2019s get this straight: Jon Evans is deeply concerned about a hypothetical dystopic fantasy scenario where Apple turns a 180, abandons all of the privacy principles the company has adhered to for decades and has prominently promoted as a competitive advantage, and begins cooperating with the U.S. government to surveil iOS users. To alleviate his concerns, Evans wants Apple to stop its efforts to close jailbreaking exploits, and in the meantime, he can\u2019t \u201crecommend the iOS ecosystem in good conscience\u201d. This, despite the fact that in the actual world, today, we know for a fact from the Hacking Team data breach that various governments around the world \u2014 including Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan, Azerbaijan, and Turkey \u2014 have been sold software that allows them to snoop on iOS devices, but only if the devices have been jailbroken.\nI\u2019m sure iOS users want Apple to get right on this.",

        "title": "Apple Watch could soon track weightlifting as well as cardio.",
        "body": "As a fitness tracker, Apple Watch is currently little more than a fancy pedometer. It only tracks distance and calories \u2014 the quantity, not the quality, of your movement. That\u2019s a problem because fitness is about more than burning calories.\nHowever, an interesting patent from Apple \u2014 plus a new technology claimed to be \u201cSiri for understanding human movement\u201d \u2014 suggests that Apple Watch could soon be adding weightlifting to its repertoire. Which would be good news for gym-goers and CrossFitters everywhere.\nApple\u2019s patents show they are thinking about weightlifting\nIn June 2014, Cupertino registered a patent for a \u201cbody-bar sensing system.\u201d The patent described a special clip you attach to a barbell or dumbbell that communicates wirelessly with your wristwatch to automatically count your reps (the number of times you repeat a lifting motion).\nFast-forward three months, and Apple Watch was announced, with Apple placing fitness front and center as a key benefit. Weightlifting, however, was conspicuously absent.\nInstead, like the FuelBand that Apple\u2019s new fitness guru, Jay Blahnik, previously worked on for Nike, the new wearable focused entirely on running and other movement-based activities.\nWeightlifting is good for everyone \u2014 not just bodybuilders\nYou might think the absence of weightlifting from Apple Watch is not a problem, especially if you associate that type of exercise with hulking Olympic athletes who grunt loudly as they hoist improbably large weights above their heads. That\u2019s hardly Apple\u2019s target audience, after all.\nBut the appeal of weightlifting is far broader than that. While running and cycling may still be popular with \u201cMAMILs\u201d (Middle-Aged Men in Lycra), a younger generation of fitness enthusiast are shunning endurance sports in favor of activities that focus on strength and aesthetic gains. In other words, lifting. Hence the growing appeal of sports like CrossFit.\nThe benefits of weightlifting are every bit as important as those of cardio. It helps increase strength and muscle mass, develop strong bones, control weight, boost stamina, manage chronic conditions and sharpen focus. So it\u2019s not a question of doing either cardio or weightlifting \u2014 ideally you\u2019d do some of both.\nIn other words, without weightlifting, there is an important component missing from Apple\u2019s fitness offering.\nIf weightlifting is so important, why did Apple leave it out?\nWhile cardio exercise is relatively easy to track using GPS sensors to measure how far an individual moves, weightlifting is much more complicated. You need to be able to identify exactly what exercise the user is performing, and the amount of weight they are lifting.\nCurrently, most gym-goers who track their weightlifting use an old-fashioned notebook or a gym-logging app like Reps & Sets (which I developed with my partner, Martin Algesten).\nThe problem with this approach is that you must log everything manually. Which is time-consuming and dull \u2014 meaning only the most dedicated weightlifters currently log their workouts.\nApple likes to provide simple solutions that are effortless to use. My guess is they are holding out on introducing support for weightlifting until they have found a truly elegant way of logging it.\nThe accelerometer in Apple Watch has untapped potential\nApple\u2019s body-bar patent describes a clip containing an accelerometer that you attach to your weights. Since the Apple Watch has an accelerometer built in, this may no longer be necessary. The wearable could track your repetitions automatically, simply by monitoring the motion of your wrist.\nThis is not a new idea. FocusMotion is a Los Angeles startup that has created an SDK for developers, enabling them to build this kind of tracking into their apps. They describe it as \u201cthe Siri for understanding human movement.\u201d While Siri uses the microphone to interpret your speech, FocusMotion uses the accelerometer to interpret your movement.\nThe company claims its SDK can not only count your reps, but even detect which exercise you are doing. So it can tell the difference between a press-up and a sit-up, simply by the motion of your wrist as you perform the exercise.\nFocusMotion is currently available for Samsung Gear and Pebble, but the company promises support for more smartwatches soon. And with watchOS 2 allowing third-party developers access to the accelerometer, FocusMotion will presumably come to Apple Watch.\nWe haven\u2019t yet seen what FocusMotion on Apple Watch can do. But if it is as good as it sounds, I think Apple should acquire it, and build the technology right into its fitness app.\nThis could be the missing ingredient that enables Apple to add weightlifting to their fitness ecosystem in their usual elegant and simple way \u2014 and without the need for extraneous accessories. If Apple doesn\u2019t do it, third-party developers almost certainly will.\nOne day I hope I\u2019ll be able to walk into the gym wearing my Apple Watch, complete my workout, and then, while I\u2019m sipping a post-workout protein shake, review an automatically generated list of all the exercises I did, neatly displayed on my Apple Watch screen.",

However, according to a new report it may be set to rock San Francisco\u2019s 7,000-seat Bill Graham Civic Auditorium \u2014 the same venue where Steve Jobs and Wozniak first unveiled the Apple II.\nThe building has been hired for a week-long \u201cprivate event\u201d lasting from September 4 until September 13, which would be more than enough time for Apple to make the necessary preparations, such as installing product banners, setting up demos, and the like.\nThe official story is that the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium is hired for a trade show, although this would be unusual since it coincides with the Labor Day holiday.\nThe venue is considerably bigger than Apple\u2019s other recent special event locations \u2014 such as the Yerba Buena Center and Flint Center \u2014 which hold just a couple of thousand people.\nGiven the rumors that Apple will announce not only the eagerly-anticipated iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but also a possible iPhone 6c, new iPads and Apple TV refresh at the event, it makes sense that Cupertino might want to go with the biggest suitable venue it can find.\nThe Bill Graham Civic Auditorium was first used by Apple in April 1977, back when it was known as the San Francisco Civic Auditorium. As the venue for the first San Francisco personal computer expo, the West Coast Computer Faire, Jobs paid $5,000 for a well-placed booth to introduce his and Woz\u2019s computer.\nProvided that this really is the venue Apple has chosen for its big iPhone 6s event, we imagine the company is spending considerably more this time round!\nSource: Hoodline\nVia: Apple Insider",
