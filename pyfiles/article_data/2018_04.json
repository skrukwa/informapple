        "title": "2016 MacBook Pro butterfly keyboards failing twice as frequently as older models",
        "body": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy\nArticle Hero Image\nApple launched its new butterfly key-switch keyboard with the MacBook, with some usability complaints starting nearly immediately, but it wasn't until its adoption in the MacBook Pro in 2016 that reliability concerns started popping up \u2014 and AppleInsider has the hard data on failure rates.\nFollowing anecdotal reports of a keyboard more prone to failure than in previous years, AppleInsider has collected service data for the first year of release of the 2014, 2015, and 2016 MacBook Pros, with an additional slightly shorter data set for the 2017 model year given that it hasn't been available for a year yet.\nNot including any Touch Bar failures, the 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard is failing twice as often in the first year of use as the 2014 or 2015 MacBook Pro models, and the 2017 is better, but not by a lot.\nAssumptions\nWhile Apple doesn't break out the numbers of MacBook Pros the company sells versus the rest of the Mac line, other data that we've collected in the course of this research suggests that the relative percentage of MacBook Pros to other models has remained the same.\nGiven that Mac sales are up only slightly year over year, we'll also assume for the sake of discussion and mathematics that there has been no appreciable increase in Mac sales.\nGiven that the keyboard mechanisms are the same in the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro models, we've combined the two models in this look. However, given that the numbers break down to about 45 percent 15-inch MacBook Pro and 45 percent 13-inch MacBook Pro across the whole dataset and model years, there is no real need to break them our separately.\nWe're also subtracting warranty-voiding accidents, like impacts, or water spills.\nThe keyboard data\nAll data has been collected from assorted Apple Genius Bars in the U.S. that we have been working with for several years, as well as Apple-authorized third-party repair shops.\nThe 2014 MacBook Pro model year saw 2120 service events in the first year, with 118 related to keyboard issues necessitating an upper case replacement \u2014 5.6 percent of all MacBook Pros serviced in the first year. The 2015 has 1904 service tickets, with 114 relating to the keyboard, making 6.0 percent.\nThe two numbers are very similar, which is to be expected. The keyboards were essentially unchanged since the 2012 Retina MacBook Pro, and should have failure rates similar to each other.\nApple released the new keyboard with the MacBook, and moved the design to the 2016 MacBook Pro. In the first year of the 2016 MacBook Pro, our data gathered 1402 warranty events, with 165 related to only the keyboard and not including the Touch Bar \u2014 11.8 percent.\nWe don't have a full year of data for the 2017 MacBook Pro yet. But, since release in June 2017, our data set has 1161 captured service events with 94 related to keyboard issues also not including any Touch Bar issues \u2014 8.1 percent.\nFailure rates across all four models are relatively static, with no appreciable increase or decrease in events reported at any time after release. Percentages of failures were comparable between the third-party authorized shops, and the Genius Bar data.\nRecidivism\nFor the 2014 MacBook Pro, of the 118 repairs, 8 came back for a second go-around on the repair within 90 days. With the 2015, 6 did. None came back for a third time.\nFor the redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro, of the 165 keyboard repairs, 51 came back again once, and of those 51, 10 more came back for a third time. The 2017 fared better in this regard, with 17 of the 94 coming back once, and 3 of those coming back for a third time.\nThis does suggest that there is another factor besides the design contributing to the failure. But, a keyboard designed for durability and portability should consider at least some of these cases that are causing multiple failures.\nThe takeaway\nClearly, the increase in number of keyboard events in a decreasing population of first-year service demands is notable. While first-year service calls have gone down with the introduction of the new models, at the same time the incidence of keyboard repairs has gone up, notably.\nApple has a second-generation MacBook Pro keyboard. It is in the 2017 MacBook Pro, and repaired 2016 models. The repair percentages on those are up from the 2014 and 2015 keyboards as well, but not nearly as much as the 2016.\nThis is an expensive repair!\nThe keyboard isn't replaceable by itself. Break one key switch, and you need to replace the whole assembly, consisting of the keyboard, the battery, and the upper case metal surrounding the keyboard and Thunderbolt 3 ports.\nWe've seen out-of-warranty pricing with labor and parts exceeding $700 for the job, and it isn't an easy repair, necessitating a complete disassembly of the machine. This same repair is $400 on the 2014 and 2015 MacBook Pro \u2014 cheaper, but still a lot of money.\nTime for action\nWe don't know for sure how many GPU failures in the 2011 through 2013 MacBook Pro line caused Apple to act, nor do we know what triggered the display coating repair extension program.",

AT&T and Verizon face accusations that they colluded with the G.S.M.A. to try to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology.\nThe investigation was opened about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department, two of the people said.

        "body": "Apps of a Feather\n\u2026Stick Together\nThe Problem\nAfter August 16th, 2018, \u201cstreaming services\u201d at Twitter will be removed. This means two things for third-party apps:\nPush notifications will no longer arrive Timelines won\u2019t refresh automatically\nIf you use an app like Talon, Tweetbot, Tweetings, or Twitterrific, there is no way for its developer to fix these issues.\nWe are incredibly eager to update our apps. However, despite many requests, Twitter has not provided a viable way for us to recreate the lost functionality. We\u2019ve been waiting for more than a year and have had one reprieve.\nWho\u2019s Affected?\nThis change affects people who use third-party Twitter apps. All software platforms are affected, but it\u2019s worse on iOS and Android where users rely on push notifications to know when something happens on Twitter.\nWhat\u2019s Changing?\nThird-party apps open a network connection to Twitter and receive a continuous stream of updates (hence the name).\nFor push notifications, this connection is done on the developer\u2019s server and used to generate messages that are sent to your devices. For timeline updates, the stream is opened directly on your mobile device or desktop computer.\nThis streaming connection is being replaced by an Account Activity API. This new infrastructure is based on \u201cwebhooks\u201d that Twitter uses to contact your server when there\u2019s activity for an account. But there are problems for app developers\u2026\nWhy Can\u2019t You Fix It?\nThe new Account Activity API is available to all developers, but still presents problems for third-party apps.\nThe free API allows us to implement some push notifications, but they would be limited to 15 Twitter accounts \u2013 our products must deliver notifications to hundreds of thousands of customers. Pricing for Premium access is $2,899 per month for 250 users. To cover this cost, a third-party app would need to charge over $16 per month to break even. We have inquired about Enterprise pricing and hope that provides an affordable option.\nAutomatic refresh of your timeline just won\u2019t work because the mechanism Twitter uses isn\u2019t compatible with apps on your mobile device or desktop computer (it\u2019s designed for web servers.) Since updating your timeline with other methods is rate-limited by Twitter, you will see delays in real-time updates during sporting events and breaking news.\nThese issues will result in workarounds that compromise the user experience or cause a developer to remove a feature completely.\nWhy is Twitter Doing This?\nA recent statement by Twitter sheds some light on this situation. In response to a query about the new Bookmarks feature they said:\n\u2026 as we stated on the blog nearly a year ago, the API plans are focused on data features and access, more than on delivering client app product features.\nPush notifications and automatic timeline updates are both client app features.\nDespite a long history of third-party contributions to the Twitter ecosystem, the company continues to actively discourage \u201cclient apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience.\u201d Including platforms where there is no native app.\nHow Can I Help?\nAs third-party developers, our hands are tied. However, you can help by letting Twitter know how you feel:\nAsk @TwitterDev to correct this situation\nShare your feelings using #BreakingMyTwitter\nTalk about it on your podcast or blog\nSpread the word with links to this website\nMany folks don\u2019t realize that their favorite Twitter app is about to break, so awareness is the first step. Together, we may be able to get Twitter to constructively address this state of affairs before the August deadline.\nThank you.",

The iPhone X alone generated 21% of total industry revenue and 35% of total industry profits during the quarter,\" Research Analyst Karn Chauhan said in a statement.\n\"The share of iPhone X is likely to grow as it advances further into its life-cycle. Additionally, the longer shelf life of all iPhones ensured that Apple still has eight out of top 10 smartphones, including its three-year-old models, generating the most profits compared to current competing smartphones from other OEMs,\" Chauhan informed.\nThe global smartphone market has already reached its peak with longer replacement cycles and key smartphone OEMs are now under pressure to book profits.\n\"Chinese OEMs cumulative profits crossed $1.3 billion during Q4 2017. This was driven by the increased mix of mid to high-end smartphones. In fact, the average selling price (ASP) of their flagship devices also increased YoY,\" added Associate Director Tarun Pathak.\nKey Chinese players like Huawei, OPPO and Vivo are now looking to scale up the price band, by leveraging their inhouse manufacturing capabilities and bringing innovation to their devices, he added.\niPhone X generated 5 times more profits than the combined profits of over 600 Android OEMs during Q4 2017.\nApple and Samsung flagship models lead in terms of profits as compared to other OEMs. Huawei was the leading brand among all the Chinese brands, with profit increasing 59% (YoY).\n\"With an increased mix of flagship sales for key Chinese brands, we expect profit share of Chinese players to grow in the coming quarters,\" the report added.",

I love my Huawei P20 and Mate10Pro. They are lifelines wherever I am in the world.\u201d It seems that a member of Gadot\u2019s publicity team posted the video on the actor\u2019s behalf, from their personal device, not recognizing that the device used might be visible to others. \u201cSometimes I rely on help from my team to post larger videos,\u201d Gadot said, \u201cAnd that is what happened here.\u201d\nPeople and companies have been getting caught out by that pesky \u2018Twitter for iPhone\u2019 tag for years now. Back in 2014, LG poked fun at the iPhone 6, from an iPhone. In 2015, BlackBerry promoted its Instagram account also from an iPhone. And in 2016, Donald Trump called for a boycott of Apple products, once again from an iPhone.\nEasier for individuals than companies to blame a member of their team, of course.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Apple will give $100 billion more back to shareholders because of the tax cut: Citigroup.",
        "body": "Apple's capital return plan will get much larger, according to one Wall Street firm.\nCiti Research reiterated its buy rating for Apple shares, saying the company will use tax reform proceeds to significantly increase its stock buyback and dividend program.\n\"We do expect volatility ahead as consensus estimates calibrate to lower March and June quarters given more tempered demand for iPhone X,\" analyst Jim Suva wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. \"Looking ahead, we expect investor focus to be on the impact from Apple's capital returns strategy, which we estimate could be a $100 billion increase, the 2H18 lineup, and continued strength in Apple's Services segment.\"\nThe company's stock rose 0.7 percent Thursday.\nSuva reaffirmed his $200 price target for Apple shares, representing 16.5 percent upside to Wednesday's close.\nThe analyst predicts the company on its next earnings call will raise its capital return program to about $400 billion from its current $300 billion authorization. Suva said a $100 billion increase is double the amount Apple has added in each of the previous two years.\nAs a result, the analyst said Apple will more than double its annual share buyback, which averaged $32 billion a year in the last five years.\n\"We believe that the shares remain attractively valued relative to the market and can undergo sustainable multiple expansion,\" he wrote.\nApple is slated to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings results on May 1, according to its website.",

        "title": "Why iPhone notifications need an overhaul - The Verge",
        "body": "Everybody hates smartphone notifications. They\u2019re interruptive, distracting, annoying, and increasingly less valuable. The signal-to-noise ratio on your average smartphone\u2019s lock screen is completely out of whack. The solution, of course, is to dive into your phone\u2019s settings and turn as many app notifications off as you can. But it\u2019s a constant struggle: every new app you install wants to get on your lock screen and the little pop-up box is all too easy to just say yes to. Ten-ish years into the smartphone revolution, we\u2019re still coming to grips with which things we should allow to interrupt us.\nIt\u2019s easy to forget as we slog through the repercussions of Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal, but for the first couple months of the year, the biggest concern in tech spheres wasn\u2019t data privacy, but attention. Notifications are the most visible way that these devices steal our attention \u2014 often for reasons that are more related to an app developer\u2019s bottom line than to a genuine need to be notified.\nI agree with all of these concerns, but I have also found myself in a curious place: I\u2019m not bothered by the notifications on my Android phone all that much. I think there are a couple of reasons for that. First, I\u2019ve done the work of editing my settings and curating my home screen so that my phone feels a little more like it\u2019s in my control.\nSecond, and more importantly, I think that Android is doing a better job of providing tools for corralling notifications than the iPhone.\nBoth platforms have no shortage of notification settings. If you look at the notification settings for any given app on the iPhone, there are six different options. The main toggle turns them on or off, that\u2019s two. Turn them on and then there are five more toggles. If you add all the different possible permutations of those toggles together, you end up with a total of 50 different ways a notification can appear (or not) on your iPhone.\nThat is a lot of options, and the cheap shot (which I will always take) is that it\u2019s too many options. But Android is even worse in that regard: there are so many checkboxes and variations between app settings that an accounting of the number of ways a notification could potentially appear on Android is nigh impossible.\nOn both of those platforms, the question isn\u2019t (or isn\u2019t just) whether or not there are too many options. It\u2019s whether or not the end state of those options are any good. The difference, I\u2019ve found, is that Android has a way of doing things that make notifications more \u201chumane\u201d than what\u2019s possible on the iPhone.\nOn Android, you can tell that app to shut up forever right when you see the notification\nYou can set a notification to silently appear in your notifications tray and lock screen. They\u2019re there if you want them, but they don\u2019t buzz your phone or drop down a box over what you\u2019re looking at\nAndroid does a much better job of prioritizing notifications. Instead of just getting listed in reverse chronological order, they get ordered by importance. Music controls up top, then messaging, then email, then all the rest. The idea is that stuff that comes from actual people you actually know comes first.\nNotifications are grouped. That\u2019s the big one for me. If I have a dozen emails and a million Twitter notifications, all that shows up in my notification shade (or lock screen) on just a couple lines. I can expand them to dig in or swipe them away en masse\nBut maybe most importantly, you can jump directly to notification settings from the notification itself with a slow / half swipe and then tap on a gear icon. This is huge. On the iPhone, when an annoying notification comes in, you have to dismiss it, then go to settings, then find the app, then change the notification settings.\nIt seems petty to complain about a few extra taps, but those taps impose a pretty heavy cognitive switching cost on the user. On Android, you can tell that app to shut up forever right when you see the notification.\nAndroid has a ton of other options. (Again, I think there are probably too many.) You can snooze notifications like you might do with email. There\u2019s this complicated set of checkboxes called \u201cNotification Channels,\u201d where, on a per-app basis, you can set priority levels for every type of notification that app might want to send. And then further customize what each priority level means.\nIt\u2019s all a lot of work to set up, but you can kind of just do it right when a notification comes in. I think Google needs to keep iterating on it and, honestly, apply a little more of that machine learning it\u2019s always talking about. But even though all the different configuration options are dizzying, I\u2019m at least happy to see that Google is trying to address the problem, even if it\u2019s just with more checkboxes.\nThe iPhone, though... Apple and I have fundamentally different philosophies about how we should relate to notifications. I see them as a new kind of email: annoying, necessary, and ultimately super useful. I want a framework for managing notifications \u2014 just like I have a framework for managing email.\nApple seems to believe that I shouldn\u2019t go in for all that. Notifications are fundamentally distracting, so I think Apple\u2019s solution is to convince us to stop giving them so much attention. Turn them off, let them float by, don\u2019t worry about reaching \u201cnotification zero\u201d (so to speak). My colleague Vlad Savov called it \u201can endless scrolling list of puffy notification clouds,\u201d and I think that\u2019s apt. The result of this philosophy, I think, is that the tools Apple provides for dealing with notifications are blunt instruments. But I also think it\u2019s the wrong philosophy. Some notifications are actually super important, but they\u2019re too easy to miss in that endless pile of clouds.",

        "title": "Apple officially discontinues AirPort router line, no plans for future hardware",
        "body": "Apple is officially exiting the wireless router business and selling off its remaining inventory of AirPort products. This includes the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and both models of AirPort Time Capsule. Apple shared the news in a statement to 9to5Mac:\nWe\u2019re discontinuing the Apple AirPort base station products. They will be available through Apple.com, Apple\u2019s retail stores and Apple Authorized Resellers while supplies last.\nWhile the news is disappointing for fans of Apple\u2019s routers, the end of the AirPort line is no surprise either.\nBloomberg reported back in November 2016 that Apple had disbanded the team responsible for developing Apple\u2019s routers, and in January 9to5Mac was first to report that Apple Stores started selling third-party mesh Wi-Fi routers from Linksys.\nAt the time, Apple told us that its AirPort line would remain \u2014 with the mesh Wi-Fi routers adding a solution for larger homes:\nPeople love our AirPort products and we continue to sell them. Connectivity is important in the home and we are giving customers yet another option that is well suited for larger homes.\nSo why discontinue the AirPort line today and not sooner? That\u2019s unclear, but Apple\u2019s formal announcement confirms what was already largely accepted: the AirPort line is dead.\nOriginal UFO-style AirPort router with add-on AirPort cards for Mac\nApple and third-party vendors will continue to sell the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time Capsule, but only while supplies last.\nThere\u2019s no price drop from Apple either, although other retailers may choose to mark down the discontinued hardware. Apple sells AirPort Express for $99, AirPort Extreme for $199, 2TB AirPort Time Capsule at $299, and 3TB AirPort Time Capsule at $399.\nCustomers can still expect these products to be supported for years to come, but not indefinitely and new hardware revisions are not coming. Apple could always choose to reenter the market if it decides it can make a meaningful impact, but for now Apple is conceding the market to ISP-supplied routers and other third-party solutions.\nPremium price and lack of hardware revisions in recent years aside, Apple\u2019s AirPort products did offer some unique and superior features to competing routers.\nApple\u2019s AirPort Utility app (which needs updating for iPhone X and larger iPads) and iOS Wi-Fi Settings integration made setting up and managing AirPort routers simpler than most third-party routers with clunky apps. AirPort Express let you turn any stereo into an AirPlay speaker with line-in, and USB printers could be shared across the network and accessed from Macs.\nAirPort Time Capsule included a 2TB or 3TB drive for automatically backing up your Mac over Wi-Fi with Time Machine, and AirPort Extreme let you easily connect a USB hard drive to your network for the same feature.\nAirPrint printers have since replaced the need for networking USB printers with AirPort Express, however, and these add support for printing from iOS.\nApple now offers its own AirPlay speaker with HomePod, and AirPlay 2 will bring even more options to market including Apple TV-connected speakers, new Sonos speakers, upcoming Beats speakers, and more.\nThere is also an existing market of peer-to-peer AirPlay speakers, but reliability of AirPlay 1 with third-party speakers is mixed at best.\nApple officially discontinuing AirPort Express adds a new layer of uncertainty to the brief appearance of AirPlay 2 support seen in iOS 11.4 beta. Support appeared to be present when used with an unreleased firmware update. AirPlay 2 support would be a nice perk for existing AirPort Express users, but shipping a major new feature for a recently discontinued product would be odd (but still welcome!).\nIn terms of Time Machine backup alternatives, Apple has almost solved the backup problem with iCloud \u2014 but not entirely.\niPhones and iPads can make full backups to iCloud over Wi-Fi and Macs can sync photo libraries, iTunes libraries, and Documents and Desktop to iCloud, but there are still limitations on backing up elements of macOS to iCloud including the 2TB size limit. More practical is relying on Time Machine for local backups using connected hard drives or network attached storage like Synology.\nThe news also means that Apple\u2019s high-end AirPorts will top out at 802.11ac and not support upcoming 802.11ad and 802.11ax advancements in Wi-Fi technology. Apple is also not offering its own solution for mesh Wi-Fi systems that are growing in popularity for larger homes with lots of connected devices.\nThe good news is a lot of newer routers take design cues from Apple\u2019s now-discontinued AirPort line. Cleanly shaped white towers and unassuming pucks have largely replaced routers that look like robot insects with airplane cockpit lights for eyes \u2014 although you can still find wonkier styles at the high end.\nApple\u2019s AirPort line was also growing increasingly dated \u2014 especially for its premium price \u2014 without a mesh tri-band system available (and extending range with AirPort Express only got so far). Apple will be pointing customers to AirPort alternatives soon, but for now here are a few tried and tested mesh Wi-Fi system options:\neero \u2013 from $295 \u2013 overall best app experience for set up and management\nNetgear Orbi (reviewed) \u2013 from $249 \u2013 highly rated performance, most generous with Ethernet ports\nLinksys Velop \u2013 from $299 \u2013 Apple\u2019s pick, AirPort Extreme/Time Capsule-like design\nGoogle Wifi (reviewed) \u2013 from $129 \u2013 simple set up and management\nYou can also rely on the modem/router combo supplied by your Internet service provider, but that usually comes with monthly rental fees and sub par performance. 9to5Toys regularly features both modem and router deals including:\nhttps://youtu.be/zxPkD9y7_uo?t=57m53s\nSo we\u2019ll continue to see AirPort hardware sold until inventory is depleted, then Apple\u2019s routers will join most of the iPod lineup and Apple\u2019s Thunderbolt Display in being officially sunset.\nIn the case of Apple\u2019s pro display, it has since promised a forthcoming replacement that will work with the new Mac Pro due out next year after a rocky experience with relying on LG for a high-end solution.\nI wouldn\u2019t expect the same 180-decision on the AirPort line however. It\u2019s a shame that Apple is leaving this market with retail stores relying on Linksys who is owned by Belkin who is owned by Foxconn, but Apple needed to make a hard decision to update or kill the AirPort line and we finally have that today.\nApple has now published a support document detailing what to look for when replacing your AirPort devices.\nTop image created by Michael Steeber\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Apple is reportedly demanding better OLED prices from Samsung for the next iPhone",
        "body": "Samsung is the sole supplier of OLED panels for Apple\u2019s iPhone X. The Korean giant was expected to make around $22 billion in revenue from supplying OLED panels to Apple in 2018. Since Samsung was the only supplier who could meet Apple\u2019s demands in terms of quantity and quality, the company was able to command a premium price from Apple for its OLED panels. However, Samsung may not be able to repeat the same for OLED panels for the next iPhone.\nWeak demand for iPhone X, after the initial euphoria driven by Apple fans, has reportedly forced the Cupertino giant to lower sales projections and cut down on component orders from suppliers, including Samsung. Making things worse, Chinese OEMs defied Samsung\u2019s expectations and didn\u2019t make the shift to OLED panels after the launch of the iPhone X, resulting in excess production capacity for Samsung.\nSamsung lost some of the bargaining power\nSamsung reportedly plans to produce 200 million OLED panels this year, of which 100 million panels are for Apple. It is twice the number of panels Samsung supplied to Apple last year for its iPhone X. Samsung plans to produce about 25 million OLED panels for the iPhone X and the rest for the iPhone X\u2019s successor due to arrive later this year. Production of OLED panels for the next iPhone will begin next month, starting with 2-3 million panels before doubling the output in June. Samsung has apparently resumed operations at the A3 line which was earlier shut down due to overcapacity.\nAccording to local reports, Samsung and Apple are in negotiations over the price of the OLED panels, with the latter reportedly asking for price cuts for those panels. The scale at which Apple buys OLED displays gives it the bargaining power to demand better prices from Samsung, which is already reeling from underutilized production capacity. Last month, the CEO of Samsung Display apparently met with Apple executives to negotiate prices but failed to reach an agreement.\nThough never officially announced, Apple apparently paid $110 (some reports peg this between $120 to $130) per OLED panel supplied by Samsung, which was almost 1/3 of the total cost of making an iPhone X. Apple obviously wants to bring the cost down and is expected to pay around $100 per panel this year as per industry sources. Reports state that Samsung is considering price cuts for OLED panels to some extent to address the problem of production overcapacity.",

        "title": "The FBI Could Have Gotten Into the San Bernardino Shooter's iPhone, But Leadership Didn't Say That",
        "body": "The Department of Justice\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) last week released a new report that supports what EFF has long suspected: that the FBI\u2019s legal fight with Apple in 2016 to create backdoor access to a San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone was more focused on creating legal precedent than it was on accessing the one specific device.\nThe report, called a \u201cspecial inquiry,\u201d details the FBI\u2019s failure to be completely forthright with Congress, the courts, and the American public. While the OIG report concludes that neither former FBI Director James Comey, nor the FBI officials who submitted sworn statements in court had \u201ctestified inaccurately or made false statements\u201d during the roughly month-long saga, it illustrates just how close they came to lying under oath.\nFrom the onset, we suspected that the FBI\u2019s primary goal in its effort to access to an iPhone found in the wake of the December 2015 mass shootings in San Bernardino wasn\u2019t simply to unlock the device at issue. Rather, we believed that the FBI\u2019s intention with the litigation was to obtain legal precedent that it could compel Apple to sabotage its own security mechanisms. Among other disturbing revelations, the new OIG report confirms our suspicion: senior leaders within the FBI were \u201cdefinitely not happy\u201d when the agency realized that another solution to access the contents of the phone had been found through an outside vendor and the legal proceeding against Apple couldn\u2019t continue.\nBy way of digging into the OIG report, let\u2019s take a look at the timeline of events:\nDecember 2, 2015: a shooting in San Bernardino results in the deaths of 14 people, including the two shooters. The shooters destroy their personal phones but leave a third phone\u2014owned by their employer\u2014untouched.\nFebruary 9, 2016: Comey testifies that the FBI cannot access the contents of the shooters\u2019 remaining phone.\nFebruary 16, 2016: the FBI applies for (and Magistrate Judge Pym grants the same day) an application for an order compelling Apple to develop a new method to unlock the phone. As part of that application, the FBI Supervisory Special Agent in charge of the investigation of the phone swears under oath that the FBI had \u201cexplored other means of obtaining [access] . . . and we have been unable to identify any other methods feasible for gaining access\u201d other than compelling Apple to create a custom, cryptographically signed version of iOS to bypass a key security feature and allow the FBI to access the device. At the same time, according to the OIG report, the chief of the FBI\u2019s Remote Operations Unit (the FBI\u2019s elite hacking team, called ROU) knows \u201cthat one of the vendors that he worked closely with was almost 90 percent of the way toward a solution that the vendor had been working on for many months.\u201d\nLet\u2019s briefly step out of the timeline to note the discrepancies between what the FBI was saying in early 2016 and what they actually knew. How is it that senior FBI officials testified that the agency had no capability to access the contents of the locked device when, the agency\u2019s own premier hacking team knew capability was within reach? Because, according to the OIG report, FBI leadership doesn\u2019t ask the ROU for its help until after testifying that FBI\u2019s techs knew of no way in.\nThe OIG report concluded that Director Comey didn\u2019t know that his testimony was false at the time he gave it. But it was false, and technical staff in FBI\u2019s own ROU knew it was false.\nNow, back to the timeline:\nMarch 1, 2016: Director Comey again testifies that the FBI has been unable to access the contents of the phone without Apple\u2019s help. Before the government applied for the All Writs Act order on February 11, Comey notes there were \u201ca whole lot of conversations going on in that interim with companies, with other parts of the government, with other resources to figure out if there was a way to do it short of having to go to court.\u201d In response to a question from Rep. Daryl Issa whether Comey was \u201ctestifying today that you and/or contractors that you employ could not achieve this without demanding an unwilling partner do it,\u201d Comey replies \u201cCorrect.\u201d\nThe OIG report concluded that Director Comey didn\u2019t know that his testimony was false at the time he gave it. But it was false, and technical staff in FBI\u2019s own ROU knew it was false.\nMarch 16, 2016: An outside vendor for the FBI completes its work on an exploit for the model in question, building on the work that, as of February 16, the ROU knew to be 90% complete.\nThe head of the FBI\u2019s Cryptologic and Electronics Analysis Unit (CEAU)\u2014the unit whose initial inability to access the phone led to the FBI\u2019s sworn statements that the Bureau knew of no method to do so\u2014is pissed that others within FBI are even trying get into the phone without Apple\u2019s help. In the words of the OIG report, \u201che expressed disappointment that the ROU Chief had engaged an outside vendor to assist with the Farook iPhone, asking the ROU Chief, \u2018Why did you do that for?\u2019\u201d\nWhy is the CEAU Chief angry? Because it means that the legal battle is over and the FBI won\u2019t be able to get the legal precedent against Apple that it was looking for. Again, the OIG report confirms our suspicions: \u201cthe CEAU Chief \u2018was definitely not happy\u2019 that the legal proceeding against Apple could no longer go forward\u201d after the ROU\u2019s vendor succeeded. Why is the CEAU Chief angry? Because it means that the legal battle is over and the FBI won\u2019t be able to get the legal precedent against Apple that it was looking for. Again, the OIG report confirms our suspicions: \u201cthe CEAU Chief \u2018was definitely not happy\u2019 that the legal proceeding against Apple could no longer go forward\u201d after the ROU\u2019s vendor succeeded.\nMarch 20, 2016: The FBI\u2019s outside vendor demonstrates the exploit for senior FBI leadership.\nOn the eve of the scheduled hearing , the Department of Justice notifies the court in California, that, despite previous statements under oath that there were no \u201cother methods feasible for gaining access,\u201d they\u2019ve now somehow found a way.\nMarch 21, 2016:, the Department of Justice notifies the court in California, that, despite previous statements under oath that there were no \u201cother methods feasible for gaining access,\u201d they\u2019ve now somehow found a way.\nIn response to the FBI\u2019s eleventh-hour revelation, the court cancels the hearing and the legal battle between the FBI and Apple is over for now.\nThe OIG report comes on the heels of a report by the New York Times that the Department of Justice is renewing its decades-long fight for anti-encryption legislation. According to the Times, DOJ officials are \u201cconvinced that mechanisms allowing access to [encrypted] data can be engineered without intolerably weakening the devices\u2019 security against hacking.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a bold claim, given that for years the consensus in the technical community has been exactly the opposite. In the 90\u2019s, experts exposed serious flaws in proposed systems to give law enforcement access to encrypted data without compromising security, including the Clipper Chip. And, as the authors of the 2015 \u201cKeys Under Doormats\u201d paper put it, \u201ctoday\u2019s more complex, global information infrastructure\u201d presents \u201cfar more grave security risks\u201d for these approaches.\nThe Department\u2019s blind faith in technologists\u2019 ability to build a secure backdoor on encrypted phones is inspired by presentations by several security researchers as part of the recent National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on encryption. But the NAS wrote that these proposals were not presented in \u201csufficient detail for a technical evaluation,\u201d so they have yet to be rigorously tested by other security experts, let alone pass muster. Scientific and technical consensus is always open to challenge, but we\u2014and the DOJ\u2014should not abandon the longstanding view, backed by evidence, that deploying widespread special access mechanisms present insurmountable technical and practical challenges.\nThe Times article also suggests that even as DOJ officials tout the possibility of secure backdoors, they\u2019re simultaneously lowering the bar, arguing that a solution need not be \u201cfoolproof\u201d if it allows the government to catch \u201cordinary, less-savvy criminals.\u201d The problem with that statement is at least two-fold:\nFirst, according to the FBI, it is the savvy criminals (and terrorists) who present the biggest risk of using encryption to evade detection. By definition, less-savvy criminals will be easier for law enforcement to catch without guaranteed access to encrypted devices. Why is it acceptable to the FBI that the solutions they demand are necessarily incapable of stopping the very harms they claim they most need backdoors in order to stop?\nSecond, the history in this area demonstrates that \u201cnot foolproof\u201d often actually means \u201ccompletely insecure.\u201d That\u2019s because any system that is designed to allow law enforcement agencies all across the country to expeditiously decrypt devices pursuant to court order will be enormously complex, raising the likelihood of serious flaws in implementation. And, regardless of who holds them, the keys used to decrypt these devices will need to be used frequently, making it even harder to defend them from bad actors. These and other technical challenges mean that the risks of actually deploying an imperfect exceptional access mechanism to millions of phones are unacceptably high. And of course, any system implemented in the US will be demanded by repressive governments around the world.\nThe DOJ\u2019s myopic focus on backdooring phones at the expense of the devices\u2019 security is especially vexing in light of reports that law enforcement agencies are increasingly able to use commercial unlocking tools to break into essentially any device on the market. And if this is the status quo without mandated backdoor access and as vendors like Apple take steps to harden their devices against hacking, imagine how vulnerable devices could be with a legal mandate. The FBI likes to paint encryption in an apocalyptic light, suggesting that the technology drastically undermines the Bureau\u2019s ability to do its job, but the evidence from the Apple fight and elsewhere is far less stark.",

        "title": "The Graphing Calculator Story - an Apple engineer who refused to leave",
        "body": "Copyright \u00a9 2004 Ron Avitzur.\nPacific Tech's Graphing Calculator has a long history. I began the work in 1985 while in school. That became Milo, and later became part of FrameMaker. Over the last twenty years, many people have contributed to it. Graphing Calculator 1.0, which Apple bundled with the original PowerPC computers, originated under unique circumstances.\nI used to be a contractor for Apple, working on a secret project. Unfortunately, the computer we were building never saw the light of day. The project was so plagued by politics and ego that when the engineers requested technical oversight, our manager hired a psychologist instead. In August 1993, the project was canceled. A year of my work evaporated, my contract ended, and I was unemployed.\nI was frustrated by all the wasted effort, so I decided to uncancel my small part of the project. I had been paid to do a job, and I wanted to finish it. My electronic badge still opened Apple's doors, so I just kept showing up.\nI had many sympathizers. Apple's engineers thought what I was doing was cool. Whenever I gave demos, my colleagues said, \"I wish I'd had that when I was in school.\" Those working on Apple's project to change the microprocessor in its computers to the IBM PowerPC were especially supportive. They thought my software would show off the speed of their new machine. None of them was able to hire me, however, so I worked unofficially, in classic \"skunkworks\" fashion.\nI knew nothing about the PowerPC and had no idea how to modify my software to run on it. One August night, after dinner, two guys showed up to announce that they would camp out in my office until the modification was done. The three of us spent the next six hours editing fifty thousand lines of code. The work was delicate surgery requiring arcane knowledge of the MacOS, the PowerPC, and my own software. It would have taken weeks for any one of us working alone.\nAt 1:00 a.m., we trekked to an office that had a PowerPC prototype. We looked at each other, took a deep breath, and launched the application. The monitor burst into flames. We calmly carried it outside to avoid setting off smoke detectors, plugged in another monitor, and tried again. The software hadn't caused the fire; the monitor had just chosen that moment to malfunction. The software ran over fifty times faster than it had run on the old microprocessor. We played with it for a while and agreed, \"This doesn't suck\" (high praise in Apple lingo). We had an impressive demo, but it would take months of hard work to turn it into a product.\nI asked my friend Greg Robbins to help me. His contract in another division at Apple had just ended, so he told his manager that he would start reporting to me. She didn't ask who I was and let him keep his office and badge. In turn, I told people that I was reporting to him. Since that left no managers in the loop, we had no meetings and could be extremely productive. We worked twelve hours a day, seven days a week. Greg had unlimited energy and a perfectionist's attention to detail. He usually stayed behind closed doors programming all day, while I spent much of my time talking with other engineers. Since I had asked him to help as a personal favor, I had to keep pace with him. Thanks to an uncurtained east-facing window in my bedroom, I woke with the dawn and usually arrived ten minutes before Greg did. He would think I had been working for hours and feel obliged to work late to stay on par. I in turn felt obliged to stay as late as he did. This feedback loop created an ever-increasing spiral of productivity.\nPeople around the Apple campus saw us all the time and assumed we belonged. Few asked who we were or what we were doing.When someone did ask me, I never lied, but relied on the power of corporate apathy. The conversations usually went like this:\nQ: Do you work here?\nA: No.\nQ: You mean you're a contractor?\nA: Actually, no.\nQ: But then who's paying you?\nA: No one.\nQ: How do you live?\nA: I live simply.\nQ: (Incredulously) What are you doing here?!\nAt that point I'd give a demo and explain that the project had been canceled but that I was staying to finish it anyway. Since I had neither a mortgage nor a family, I could afford to live off savings. Most engineers at Apple had been through many canceled projects and completely understood my motivation.\nApple at that time had a strong tradition of skunkworks projects, in which engineers continued to work on canceled projects in hopes of producing demos that would inspire management to revive them. On occasion, they succeeded. One project, appropriately code-named Spectre, was canceled and restarted no fewer than five times. Engineers worked after hours on their skunkworks, in addition to working full time on their assigned projects. Greg and I, as nonemployees who had no daytime responsibilities, were merely extending this tradition to the next level.\nIn September, Apple Facilities tried to move people into our officially empty offices. They noticed us. The Facilities woman assumed that I had merely changed projects and had not yet moved to my new group, something that happened all the time. She asked what group I worked in, since it would be that group's responsibility to find me space. When I told her the truth, she was not amused. She called Security, had them cancel our badges, and told us in no uncertain terms to leave the premises.\nWe were saved by the layoffs that began that month. Twenty percent of Apple's fifteen thousand workers lost their jobs, but Greg and I were safe because we weren't on the books in the first place and didn't officially exist. Afterwards, there were plenty of empty offices. We found two and started sneaking into the building every day, waiting out in front for real employees to arrive and casually tailgating them through the door. Lots of people knew us and no one asked questions, since we wore our old badges as decoys.\nWe were making great progress, but we couldn't get it done alone. Creating sophisticated software requires a team effort. One person can use smoke and mirrors to make a demo that dazzles an audience. But shipping that to a million customers will expose its flaws and leave everyone looking bad. It is a cliche in our business that the first 90 percent of the work is easy, the second 90 percent wears you down, and the last 90 percent - the attention to detail - makes a good product. Making software that is simultaneously easy to learn, easy to use, friendly, useful, and powerful takes people with an incredible combination of skills, talent, and artistry working together with intensity and patience. Greg and I could do the core engineering, but that was a far cry from creating a finished product.\nAmong other things, we needed professional quality assurance (QA), the difficult and time-consuming testing that would show us the design flaws and implementation bugs we couldn't see in our own work. Out of nowhere, two QA guys we had never met approached us, having heard about our venture through the rumor mill. (We had become a kind of underground cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.) Their day job, QA-ing system software, was mind-numbingly boring. They volunteered to help us, saying, \"Let's not tell our boss about this, OK?\" One guy had a Ph.D. in mathematics; the other had previously written mathematical software himself. They were a godsend. They started right away.\nNext, we needed help writing software to draw the three-dimensional images that our software produced. A friend with expertise in this area took a weekend off from his startup company to write all of this software. He did in two days what would have taken me a month.\nMy skunkworks project was beginning to look real with help from these professionals as well as others in graphic design, documentation, programming, mathematics, and user interface. The secret to programming is not intelligence, though of course that helps. It is not hard work or experience, though they help, too. The secret to programming is having smart friends.\nThere was one last pressing question: How could we get this thing included with the system software when the new machines shipped? The thought that we might fail to do this terrified me far more than the possibility of criminal prosecution for trespass. All the sweat that Greg and I had put in, all the clandestine aid from the friends, acquaintances, and strangers on whom I had shamelessly imposed, all the donations of time, expertise, hardware, soft drinks, and junk food would be wasted.\nOnce again, my sanity was saved by the kindness of a stranger. At 2:00 one morning, a visitor appeared in my office: the engineer responsible for making the PowerPC system disk master. He explained things this way: \"Apple is a hardware company. There are factories far away building Apple computers. One of the final steps of their assembly line is to copy all of the system software from the 'Golden Master' hard disk onto each computer's hard disk. I create the Golden Master and FedEx it to the manufacturing plant. In a very real and pragmatic sense, I decide what software does and does not ship.\" He told me that if I gave him our software the day before the production run began, it could appear on the Golden Master disk. Then, before anyone realized it was there, thirty thousand units with our software on the disks would be boxed in a warehouse. (In retrospect, he may have been joking. But we didn't know that, so it allowed us to move forward with confidence.)\nOnce we had a plausible way to ship, Apple became the ideal work environment. Every engineer we knew was willing to help us. We got resources that would never have been available to us had we been on the payroll. For example, at that time only about two hundred PowerPC chips existed in the world. Most of those at Apple were being used by the hardware design engineers. Only a few dozen coveted PowerPC machines were even available in System Software for people working on the operating system. We had two. Engineers would come to our offices at midnight and practically slip machines under the door. One said, \"Officially, this machine doesn't exist, you didn't get it from me, and I don't know you. Make sure it doesn't leave the building.\"\nIn October, when we thought we were almost finished, engineers who had been helping us had me demonstrate our software to their managers. A dozen people packed into my office. I didn't expect their support, but I felt obliged to make a good-faith effort to go through their official channels. I gave a twenty-minute demonstration, eliciting \"oohs\" and \"ahhs.\" Afterward, they asked, \"Who do you report to? What group are you in? Why haven't we seen this earlier?\" I explained that I had been sneaking into the building and that the project didn't exist. They laughed, until they realized I was serious. Then they told me, \"Don't repeat this story.\"\nThe director of PowerPC software was an academic on leave from Dartmouth. The director of PowerPC marketing was the son of a math teacher. Seeing the value of putting this educational software on every Macintosh in every school, they promptly adopted us.\nThen things got really weird. The QA manager assigned people to test our product. (I didn't tell him that those people were already working on it.) The localization group assigned people to translate it into twenty languages. The human interface group ran a formal usability study. I was at the center of a whirlwind of activity. Nevertheless, Greg and I still had to sneak into the building. The people in charge of the PowerPC project, upon which the company's future depended, couldn't get us badges without a purchase order. They couldn't get a purchase order without a signed contract. They couldn't get a contract without approval from Legal, and if Legal heard the truth, we'd be escorted out of the building.\nGreg was lurking outside one day, trying to act casual, when another engineer accosted him and said, \"I'm sick and tired of you guys loitering in front of the building every day!\" Later he phoned the appropriate bureaucrats on our behalf. I listened to his side of the conversation for twenty minutes: \"No, there is no PO, because we're not paying them. No, there is no contract, because they are not contractors. No, they are not employees; we have no intention of hiring them. Yes, they must have building access because they are shipping code on our box. No, we don't have a PO number. There is no PO, because we're not paying them.\" Finally, he wore them down. They said to use the standard form to apply for badges, but to cross out Contractor and write in Vendor. Where it asked for a PO number, we were to use the magic words \"No dollar contract.\" We got badges the next day. They were orange Vendor badges, the same kind the people working in the cafeteria, watering the plants, and fixing the photocopy machines had.\nOfficial recognition made life exciting. Suddenly even more people became enthusiastically involved. When formal usability testing with students and teachers began, we discovered, again, that we were far from being done.\nI had long been proud of the elegance and simplicity of our design. I wanted our program to ship with every Macintosh, so I had designed it for all users, even those who know little about computers and hate math. I wanted to make mathematics as easy and enjoyable as playing a game. In a classroom, any time spent frustrated with the computer is time taken away from teaching. Sitting behind a two-way mirror, watching first-time users struggle with our software, reminded me that programmers are the least qualified people to design software for novices. Humbled after five days of this, Greg and I went back and painstakingly added feedback to the software, as if we were standing next to users, explaining it ourselves.\nOur recognition made life interesting in other ways since we could no longer remain a well kept secret. After a demo to outside developers, one person called Apple claiming that we infringed his patent, causing a fire drill until I could show prior art. Another company, the makers of Mathematica\u0099, simply demanded that our product be pulled. Apple very politely declined. One week we were evading security, the next week Apple is rising to our defense.\nBy November, we were in full crunch mode, working sixteen hours a day, seven days a week, and feeling the pressure. The home stretch was a blur - wake up, grab a bagel, eat it while driving, work till we drop, sleep, repeat. If this story were a movie, you would now see the clock hand spinning and the calendar pages blowing away in the wind.\nWe finished in January 1994. Graphing Calculator has been part of the Macintosh ever since. Teachers around the world use it as an animated blackboard to illustrate abstract concepts visually. It shipped on more than twenty million machines. It never officially existed.\nWhy did Greg and I do something so ludicrous as sneaking into an eight-billion-dollar corporation to do volunteer work? Apple was having financial troubles then, so we joked that we were volunteering for a nonprofit organization. In reality, our motivation was complex. Partly, the PowerPC was an awesome machine, and we wanted to show off what could be done with it; in the Spinal Tap idiom, we said, \"OK, this one goes to eleven.\" Partly, we were thinking of the storytelling value. Partly, it was a macho computer guy thing - we had never shipped a million copies of software before. Mostly, Greg and I felt that creating quality educational software was a public service. We were doing it to help kids learn math. Public schools are too poor to buy software, so the most effective way to deliver it is to install it at the factory.\nBeyond this lies another set of questions, both psychological and political. Was I doing this out of bitterness that my project had been canceled? Was I subversively coopting the resources of a multinational corporation for my own ends? Or was I naive, manipulated by the system into working incredibly hard for its benefit? Was I a loose cannon, driven by arrogance and ego, or was I just devoted to furthering the cause of education?\nI view the events as an experiment in subverting power structures. I had none of the traditional power over others that is inherent to the structure of corporations and bureaucracies. I had neither budget nor headcount. I answered to no one, and no one had to do anything I asked. Dozens of people collaborated spontaneously, motivated by loyalty, friendship, or the love of craftsmanship. We were hackers, creating something for the sheer joy of making it work.\nAfter six months of grueling unpaid labor, Greg couldn't explain to his parents what he had done. They didn't use computers, and the only periodical they read was the New York Times. So as the project was winding down, I asked Greg if he wanted his photo in the Times so his parents would know what he was up to. He gave the only possible response: \"Yeah, right.\" We made a bet for dinner at Le Mouton Noir, a fine French restaurant in Saratoga. To be honest, I expected to lose, but I made a phone call. Greg doesn't bet against me any more: On March 11, 1994, the front page of the Times business section contained an article on the alliance among Apple, IBM, and Motorola, picturing Greg and me in my front yard with a view of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Someone I knew in Apple Public Relations was livid. I had asked if she wanted to send someone for the interview, but she had said that engineers are not allowed to talk with the press. It's hard to enforce that kind of thing with people who can't be fired. It was positive press for Apple, though, and our parents were pleased.\nWe wanted to release a Windows version as part of Windows 98, but sadly, Microsoft has effective building security.\nPostscript: After the events described, we made everything retroactively legitimate by licensing the software to Apple for distribution. Pacific Tech started a few years later, and continued to develop Graphing Calculator, both in new free versions that Apple bundled with Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9, and commercial releases.",

        "body": "When Steve Jobs demonstrated the first iPhone at Macworld in January 2007, he famously stated that smartphones at the time had \u2018baby software\u2019 while referring to WAP as the \u2018baby internet\u2019.\nWhile that may have been true, it\u2019s easy to look back today and highlight everything that iOS didn\u2019t have. You see, when it came to operating system development, Steve Jobs adamantly believed that you had to start humbly, focusing on the simple elements such as what a button would look like. Then build upon the solid foundation.\nIf we included every iOS feature you'd be here all week and probably bored to death, so we'll only focus on the major stuff.\niPhone OS 1 | iPhone OS 2 | iPhone OS 3 | iOS 4 | iOS 5\niOS 6 | iOS 7 | iOS 8 | iOS 9 | iOS 10 | iOS 11 | iOS 12\niPhone OS 1\nAnnounced: January 9, 2007\nReleased: June 29, 2007\nApple\u2019s original iPhone OS was a seminal achievement. Running a modified version of OS X, the Apple\u2019s Mac Operating System, Apple's engineers, had a number challenges ahead. Not only did the code base have to be reduced to a tenth of its size, during development engineers had to simulate chip speeds, and the impact on battery life as the physical chips would not be manufactured until much later into the development cycle.\nSteve received his first of many cheers from the crowd early in the iPhone announcement \u2018playing\u2019 the audience:\nToday, we\u2019re introducing three revolutionary products of this class. The first one: is a widescreen iPod with touch controls. The second: is a revolutionary mobile phone. And the third is a breakthrough Internet communications device. So, three things: a widescreen iPod with touch controls; a revolutionary mobile phone; and a breakthrough Internet communications device. An iPod, a phone, and an Internet communicator. An iPod, a phone \u2026 Are you getting it? These are not three separate devices, this is one device, and we are calling it iPhone.\nInitially Apple used the three above associations to group iPhone OS features and to better resonate with consumers, after all, who on the planet didn\u2019t know what an iPod was.\nThe non-editable dock contained;\nPhone - including Visual VoiceMail\nMail - HTML e-mail\nSafari - web browser\niPod - music/video player\nWhile on its single, non-editable Home screen the following built-in applications were provided;\nText \u2022 Calendar \u2022 Photos \u2022 Camera\nYouTube \u2022 Stocks \u2022 Maps \u2022 Weather\nClock \u2022 Calculator \u2022 Notes \u2022 Settings\nApple and Google weren\u2019t competitors yet in this space, so the Apple Maps and YouTube applications utilized Google\u2019s back-end services. Meanwhile, Yahoo provided the back-end service for the Weather app.\nSteve Jobs was also an advocate of Skeuomorphism interface design, with icons mimicking real-life objects and materials within the iPhone\u2019s OS. This trend would peak with iPad apps containing leather stitching and paper textures. iOS 7 would later banish this to the history books.\nSkeuomorphism at its worse \u2022 Things improved from iOS 7 onwards\niPhone OS 1 introduced many of the concepts that we\u2019re familiar with today including slide to unlock, multi-touch including pinch to zoom and badge notifications. What was missing? Famously, Text didn\u2019t support the widely adopted MMS standard, you couldn't search in the Contacts app, while Copy & Paste including other features such as wallpapers would be added in future iOS releases.\nAdditionally, the majority of your content was synced via physically connecting to a PC or Mac via iTunes.\nApple introduced new features rapidly during the lifecycle of iPhone OS 1. Headline additions included;\nHome button double-click shortcut to phone favorites or music controls\nSpacebar double-tap shortcut to insert full stop and space\nMaps gained the 'Locate Me' feature to determine the phone's approximate location, using a combination of cellular triangulation and Wi-Fi data from Skyhook Wireless; also hybrid map support and the 'Drop Pin' feature\nIcons on the home screens got the option to be rearranged and placed on multiple home screens (up to nine).\nWeb Clips could be added to (and subsequently removed from) the home screen\nSMS messages could be sent to multiple contacts using messages\niTunes store debuted\niPhone OS 2\nAnnounced: March 2008\nReleased: July 11, 2008\nThe headline feature for iPhone OS 2 was the introduction of Apps. Apple introduced its first SDK for developers, and the App Store for consumers provided a single point of entry to find and download apps. At launch, there were circa 500 apps available, while today there are several million.\nOther notable changes included;\nFull Push e-mail supporting mass move and delete\nAbility to view iWork and MS Office attachments in e-mail\nMultiple calendars support\nSeparate Contacts app with search for contacts\nPictures downloads from Safari and Mail to Photos\nParental controls\nScientific calculator in landscape mode\nGoogle Street View for Maps; location sharing via e-mail\nPressing the Home button from any Home screen navigates to the first Home screen\nEmoji support for Japan. Other countries can access via apps\niTunes no longer restricted to Wi-Fi only\niPhone OS 3\nAnnounced: March 2009\nReleased: June 17, 2009\nDuring the lifecycle of iPhone OS 3, Apple launched the iPad resulting in Apple renaming iPhone OS to iOS. iOS 3.2 was launched alongside the original iPad.\niOS 3 introduced the long-anticipated system-wide \u2018cut, copy and paste\u2019. Spotlight was introduced, providing a search including contacts, e-mail, notes, and apps. While the number of Home Screens was expanded to 11, allowing for 180 apps.\nText application got renamed to Messages and gained support for MMS. Camera app gained auto-focus while video recording is now supported for the newly announced iPhone 3GS.\nOther notable changes included;\nTurn-by-turn navigation support\nPhotos trimming within the Photos app and delete multiple apps\nFind My iPhone option for MobileMe\nTethering over USB and Bluetooth\niOS 4\nAnnounced: March 2010\nReleased: June 21, 2010\nThis was the first iOS release to drop support for older devices, namely the original iPhone and iPod Touch. Functionally, iOS 4 was notable for introducing folders onto the Home screen and supporting custom Home screen wallpapers. Fast app switching was introduced while limited multi-tasking features were also added along with background audio playback.\nOther notable changes included;\nFaceTime\n5x digital zoom for the Camera app\nUnified inboxes in Mail\nUpdated carrier signal strength display and updated method for calculating signal strength (fall-out from antennagate)\nAirPlay\nAirPrint via Print Center\nMulti-tasking tray supporting Volume controls, AirPlay controls, Brightness and screen rotation/lock switch\nPersonal HotSpot\niOS 5\nAnnounced: June 6, 2011\nReleased: October 12, 2011\nIntroducing Siri. iOS 5 brought Apple\u2019s Digital Assistant (beta) to the world. Notifications got a substantial overhaul with temporary banners appearing at the top of the screen and all consolidated in the Notification Center. The iOS dependence on a computer was further reduced as System Software Updates could be downloaded wirelessly, while content could be synced via Apples iCloud web-services.\nOther notable changes included;\niPad multi-tasking gestures\nCamera short-cut from lock screen\niMessages synced across iOS devices\nGroup messaging\niPod app removed, replaced by Music and Videos apps\nVolume up key as shutter release\nPhotos got built-in photo editing for crop, red-eye, auto-enhance and rotation\nSyncing content between devices via iCloud, including Photos, Contacts, Calendars, Notes, Reminders, Mail, Safari bookmarks, Settings and backups\nFull built-in Emoji support\nThis also marked the switch when Apple would announce future iOS releases at its World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC), a tradition that remains to this day.\niOS 6\nAnnounced: June 11, 2012\nReleased: September 19, 2012\niOS 6 was infamous for the new Apple Maps app that replaced Google Maps providing 3D overviews, Satellite views, and Flyover for 3D satellite views. Data inaccuracies resulted in an open letter of apology from CEO Tim Cook and the departure of Scott Forstall. Siri further increased its reach by becoming available on the 3rd generation iPad and above, iPad Mini and 5th Generation iPod Touch. Boarding a plane would never be the same again as the Passbook app was introduced to manage boarding passes, tickets, loyalty cards and coupons.\nOther notable changes included;\nSiri further enhanced to provide information on sports, local searches around the world, movie information, ability to book restaurant tables, launch apps and read notifications. Eyes Free would be the first foray into the automotive world.\nShared Photo streams\nFaceTime over cellular\nPanorama Mode\niOS 7\nAnnounced: June 10, 2013\nReleased: September 18, 2013\nSince it\u2019s inception, iOS\u2019s user interface had remained much the same and was starting to age in comparison to Android. This changed at its seventh major release.\nUnder the guidance of Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of design, iOS 7 introduced a substantially redesigned flat user interface and constructs that permeated throughout the whole of iOS. Goodbye skeuomorphism.\nAlso, iOS 7 added a new Notification Center, while the new Control Center provided fast access to the most commonly used controls and features.\niOS 7 was oft criticized for being design-led as opposed to productivity focused, with usability hampered by needless animations and lack of consistency.\nOther notable changes included;\nAirDrop for wirelessly sharing content between Apple devices\nCarPlay\nSiri redesign and new voices\nNew system font\nNew system-wide back navigation gesture, swipe from left edge of the screen\nSpotlight Search available from all Home screens\nRedesigned app switcher with new swipe to close gesture\nDynamic wallpapers and Parallax wallpapers\nBlock list for the Phone app\nFaceTime Audio\niTunes Radio\nCamera app with 120 fps video recording for supported hardware\nFull release notes and features for iOS 7 can be found here in the GSMArena Glossary\niOS 8\nAnnounced: June 2, 2014\nReleased: September 17, 2014\nAfter the significant redesign, iOS 8 was a polishing update, mopping many of the outstanding issues. It also brought together Apple\u2019s iOS devices and Mac computers by introducing Hand Off and Continuity features.\nThose allowed tasks started on one device to be picked up seamlessly on another. Answer a phone call on an iPad or Mac or send and receive SMS/MMS messages on an iPad or Mac.\nApple Pay launched with the iPhone 6/6 Plus. Later releases of iOS 8 would bring support for the Apple Watch and the launch of Apple Music. The HomeKit framework was announced providing support at an OS level for smart-home appliances and automation.\nApple also introduced Metal, a low overhead 3D hardware accelerated API providing improved performance for graphically rich games and applications.\nOther notable changes included;\nQuickType\niCloud enhanced to support Photo Library and iCloud Drive\nVoice messages within Messages\nNew gestures for deletion, flagging or moving messages in Mail\nSupport for third party widgets in Today view\nFlyover City Tours for Maps\nHey Siri for when a device is plugged into power\nWi-Fi calling\nWeather data provided by The Weather Channel\nFull release notes and features for iOS 8 can be found here in the GSMArena Glossary\niOS 9\nAnnounced: June 8, 2015\nReleased: September 16, 2015\nA new system-wide feature providing Proactive assistance was introduced, though Siri and advanced search, users are now presented with contextually aware information. The Notes app within iOS 9 received notable (pun intended) updates with the ability to add photos, hand-drawn sketches, different fonts within a note.\nApple added a new app called News, providing curated lists of personalized news content for iOS users, offering content from favorite websites and newspapers\nThe iPad multitasking experience was improved by the introducing Slide Over, Split View and Picture in picture.\n3D touch came providing \u2018peek\u2019 & \u2018pop\u2019 functionality, while Night Shift made the display color warmer for more comfortable viewing in the evening.\nOther notable changes included;\nSearch for settings\nWallet replaced the Passbook app\nLow Power Mode\nUpper/Lower case keyboard\nWireless CarPlay\nFull release notes and features for iOS 9 can be found here in the GSMArena Glossary\niOS 10\nAnnounced: June 13, 2016\nReleased: September 13, 2016\niOS 10 brought raise to wake as well as a new lock screen with gestures for accessing the camera and Today view.\nSupport for third-party VoIP for receiving calls on the Lock screen was also part of this release to keep up with the times, while the new iPhone 7 Plus introduced creating a fake bokkeh called Portrait mode.\nOther notable changes included:\nThe option to hide the majority of the built in apps\nA new look for Maps\nFace recognition for the Photos app\nNew Home app for controlling HomeKit accessories\nAll new design for Apple Music\nControl Center redesign\n3D Touch extended to support Lock screen notifications\nFind My AirPods added to Find My iPhone app\nFull release notes and features for iOS 10 can be found here in the GSMArena Glossary\niOS 11 - Current release\nAnnounced: June 5, 2017\nReleased: September 19, 2017\nControl Center was redesigned the last time Apple updated its mobile OS, bringing all controls together on one page and adding support for 3D Touch. The Lock screen and Notification Center got combined, while the App Store was completely redesigned. Augmented Reality apps got kick-started through ARKIt.\nApple Pay Cash debuted in the US, while the new iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X Apple introduced Studio Lighting into the Camera app.\nLater releases introduced support for the Apple HomePod and the iPhone Battery Health (beta) feature.\nLater iOS 11 beta's have introduced AirPlay 2, Apple's next-generation robust multi-room device streaming protocol. You can read our AirPlay 2 first impressions here.\niOS 11 had one of the slowest adoption rates of any previous iOS version and has been criticised for its battery life on iPhones that are only 1 or 2 generations old and for a number of high profile bugs.\nOther notable changes included:\nNew Files manager app\nNew Siri voices\nPhotos enhanced to include new Loop, Bounce and Long Exposure effects for Live Photos\nEnhanced iPad experience including all new dock, enhanced Slide Over and Split View and drag and drop between apps\nFull release notes and features for iOS 11 can be found here in the GSMArena Glossary\niOS 12 The future - what we expect\nWell done for making it this far, we tried to keep it as short as possible but the breadth of the subject matter made it all but impossible.\nThat's why, we felt we'll leave our iOS 12 impressions for another post available here",

        "title": "Apple iPad (2018) review: the best tablet under $500",
        "body": "Apple\u2019s new base-level iPad is very good, but you knew that. Apple hasn\u2019t produced a \u201cbad\u201d iPad in I don\u2019t know how long \u2014 though it has allowed them to get a little long in the tooth from time to time. (The iPad Mini needs to either be refreshed or put down, for example.) Last year, my review of the iPad was summed up by simply telling you that it\u2019s an iPad. The same thing applies this year.\nBut last year\u2019s iPad earned effusive praise for packing a bunch of great technology into the newly low price point of $329. The same thing applies this year, but the technology isn\u2019t quite as new. So the shine is off a bit. This iPad feels more like the result of paper-pushing rather than envelope-pushing.\nThis is the part where you\u2019d expect me to tell you that since Apple is coasting a bit, there might be a better option out there, a product that competes with the iPad at the sub-$500 price point and delivers something that\u2019s at least within the ballpark of functionality and experience.\nYou\u2019d be wrong. There isn\u2019t a single viable competitor to the iPad. It is the only good tablet for less than four or five hundred bucks. So, if nothing else, I\u2019m thankful that it\u2019s as good as it is.\nThe new, sixth-generation iPad has two new features compared to last year\u2019s model: support for the $99 Apple Pencil and a faster processor, the A10 \u201cFusion.\u201d Everything else \u2014 and I mean everything \u2014 is exactly the same as last year.\niPad (sixth-generation) specs and price 9.4 x 6.6 x 0.29 inches; 1.03 pounds\n9.7-inch display; 2048 x 1536 resolution\nOleophobic coating, but not laminated\nApple Pencil support\nApple A10 Fusion processor\n8-megapixel rear camera, 1.2-megapixel front camera\nFirst-gen Touch ID home button\nNo support for Smart Connector\nTwo stereo speakers, located at the bottom\n$329 for 32GB Wi-Fi model\n$100 extra for 128GB of storage\n$130 extra for LTE version\nThat means the 9.7-inch screen is very good, but it doesn\u2019t hold up against the screen on the iPad Pro. It has a visible air gap, it lacks the faster refresh rate, and it can\u2019t adjust itself to the color temperature of the room. Those three features make the iPad Pro\u2019s screen seem downright magical. The iPad\u2019s screen doesn\u2019t feel magical anymore, but it is nevertheless better than anything else in its price range.\nI\u2019ve been using the iPad for a little less than a week, and I can report that it feels fast, lasts all day (Apple claims 10 hours of battery life, and it gets close), and runs everything I\u2019ve thrown at it well. There is a speed difference between the iPad and the iPad Pro, but it\u2019s not so great that I think anybody who buys this will care \u2014 or maybe even notice. (We\u2019re talking an extra half-second to launch an app.) Drawing with the Apple Pencil on the iPad is just as good to me as on the iPad Pro, though true drawing professionals may notice a difference. Since so much of this iPad is recycled from last year\u2019s iPad, I\u2019m going to do the same with my review. Here are a couple things I wrote:\nWhen I simply say \u201cit is an iPad,\u201d reasonable people know exactly what I mean. They know that it is a thin, fast tablet with a good screen, and it has a lot of apps so you that you can do iPad things. ... Fundamentally, what I am trying to tell you is that this is an iPad. You trust that iPads are decent tablets and that they have a basic level of quality, speed, and functionality\nAll of that is still true. If your iPad is starting to slow down or otherwise become a pain, go out and get this iPad to replace it, and don\u2019t sweat the competition. That competition consists of, well, not much. There are Amazon tablets that are dirt cheap Amazon Prime and Kindle delivery vehicles. There are Windows tablets for less than $500, but none I would recommend. There is one (1) ChromeOS tablet, but it\u2019s not out yet and not likely to be anywhere near as good. There are Android tablets, technically, but let us not speak of them for they are bad. (Google, you might note, also does not speak of Android tablets much anymore.)\nReally, the biggest competition for the $329 iPad is the $649 iPad Pro. That extra $300-plus buys you the following:\nA slightly bigger, better screen\nA faster processor and more RAM for running multiple apps\nA smart keyboard connector\nBetter cameras\nMore speakers\nI think, for the vast majority of people, the cheaper iPad is the better choice. Unless you know for sure that you are going to be able to use the iPad Pro as a laptop replacement (and are very adept at the ins and outs of how iOS works), just get the cheaper one.\nYou won\u2019t miss the extra features \u2014 or, more to the point, you probably won\u2019t miss them to the tune of $300. The only thing that kept zinging me is that the iPad can\u2019t run three apps at once like the Pro can. Well, technically it can run three apps if you include two split-screen apps and a third app showing video in picture-in-picture. But if you open a third app in a slide-over window with two apps split-screened, the background apps will pause. I only ran into that because I kept trying to use the iPad like a full computer. Most people will use it for \u201ciPad things\u201d and do just fine.\nDid Apple do the absolute bare minimum with this iPad? Yup. The reasoning, ostensibly, was to get Apple Pencil support in there for schools without raising the price. But I suspect schools would have been happier with a price cut on last year\u2019s model instead of an all-new one \u2014 especially since iPads pretty much require a rugged case for students and, in many cases, a keyboard.\nI wish that Apple had found a way to get the Smart Keyboard Connector on this iPad. Bluetooth keyboards are a pain. In fact, if I were Apple, I would have probably just skipped releasing this iPad altogether and waited to release one that could support the smart connector. By then, maybe a new version of the iPad Pro with more differentiating features (like Face ID, perhaps) would be available.\nThis is a very good tablet. The best, in fact, under $500. It\u2019s too bad that nothing else comes close, because maybe that competition would have inspired Apple to make something a little better.\nCorrection: added more detail and nuance about how multitasking works with split-screen, slide-over, and picture-in-picture at 1:45ET on April 3rd.",

        "title": "It\u2019s time to give Firefox a fresh chance",
        "body": "Ever since it was first released almost a decade ago, Google\u2019s Chrome browser has been the most consistent piece of technology in my life. I\u2019ve gone through a legion of phones, laptops, and headphones, I\u2019ve jumped around between Android, iOS, Windows Phone, macOS, and Windows, but I\u2019ve rarely had reason to doubt my browser choice. Things have changed in recent times, however, and those changes have been sufficient to make me reconsider. After so many years away, I\u2019m returning to Firefox, in equal measure pushed by Chrome\u2019s downsides as I am pulled by Firefox\u2019s latest upgrades.\nIf a friend were to ask me what the best web browser is, I\u2019d answer \u201cChrome\u201d in a heartbeat, so don\u2019t mistake this as a screed against Google\u2019s browser. I still see it as the most fully-featured and trouble-free option for exploring the web. It\u2019s just that sometimes there are reasons to not use the absolute best option available. Here are mine.\nChrome has outgrown its competition in a way that\u2019s unhealthy\nThe thing that woke me up to my over-reliance on Chrome was when Google implemented an ad blocker directly into the browser. I\u2019d usually be delighted to have ad blocking automated away, but the surrounding conversation about Google \u2014 an ad company \u2014 having sway over which ads are and are not acceptable to present to users convinced me there was a problem. According to NetMarketShare, Chrome is now used by 60 percent of web users, both on mobile and desktop devices, and Firefox looks respectable with 12 percent of desktops, but is almost a rounding error with only 0.6 percent of mobile devices. Apple\u2019s Safari and Microsoft\u2019s Edge don\u2019t look much better, even though they\u2019re the default option on their respective OS platforms.\nChrome has outgrown its competition in a way that\u2019s unhealthy. My colleague Tom Warren already detailed the deleterious effects of Chrome\u2019s outsize influence, with web developers optimizing and coding specifically for Chrome (and Google encouraging the practice), with unhappy connotations of the crummy old days when Internet Explorer was the dominant browser for the web. Chrome came to liberate us from the shackles of IE, but like many revolutionary leaders, too many years in power have corrupted Chrome\u2019s original mission.\nBefore I settled on Firefox as my Escape from Chrometown alternative, I gave Safari a solid couple of months as my primary browser. If I were committed to using only iPhones, iPads, and Macs for the rest of my tech life, I might still be on Safari. Its performance is great on both iOS and macOS \u2014 though I\u2019d be lying to you if I were to say I could tell a difference in speed between any of the modern browsers \u2014 and it offers a choice of ad blockers among a reasonable selection of browser extensions. The options are nowhere near as varied as Chrome\u2019s extension library, but that\u2019s a non-issue for me since I\u2019ve never been dependent on extensions in the first place.\nToday\u2019s Firefox is a very different beast from the memory hog of a few years ago\nBut I\u2019m writing this in Firefox today for a very simple reason: cross-platform compatibility. I recently set up a new Windows laptop, and having to deal with a browser that doesn\u2019t know me or my preferences was just an exercise in frustration. Safari\u2019s nice, and I\u2019m certain it\u2019s good enough to supplant Chrome for Apple device users, but for me it\u2019s a non-starter. I need a browser that knows me as well on a Huawei smartphone or Lenovo ThinkPad as it understands me an on iPhone X.\nLike Chrome and Safari, Firefox has a built-in password manager that saves my logins and passwords as I browse, which I can then protect with a master password. One password, I can remember. Dozens of weird alphanumerical concoctions? That\u2019s where I need the browser to step in and help, and Firefox has been great in that respect. With Safari, I had a couple of occasions where the browser would either forget a password or get confused about where to save it when, for example, I\u2019m logging into more than one Google account. Firefox keeps all this stuff straight and, so far as I can tell, secure. (Security pros will tell you that a dedicated password manager is best, of course.)\nIn pondering my browser switch, I did the obvious thing and looked at benchmark comparisons among the most popular browsers, while also reading up on real-world experience with regard to battery life and other less obvious impacts. That piqued my interest in Opera, which has a built-in VPN and, like Firefox, plenty of privacy protection and anti-tracking options. I like the philosophy embodied by Opera, but I don\u2019t like that the Android versions of its browsers serve ads on my lock screen.\nAfter spending some quality time comparing the actual experience of using Chrome, Safari, and Firefox across a variety of websites, I\u2019m confident in saying browser benchmarks are profoundly uninformative. The truth is that performance differences are not substantial enough to be noticed. If anything, you\u2019re most likely to clash with \u201conly works in Chrome\u201d incompatibilities, but that\u2019s kind of the whole reason for me to avoid Chrome: someone has to keep using the alternatives so as to give them a reason to exist.\nBrowsers these days are more similar than they are different\nBut I\u2019m no martyr sacrificing himself for the common good here. Firefox is a legitimate, high-quality replacement for Chrome. Ever since its Quantum engine overhaul, Firefox has been garnering plenty of praise from satisfied users, and though I\u2019m only just starting to get into using it full-time as my main browser, everything I\u2019ve seen has been encouraging. Firefox has certainly grown far beyond slow memory hog that I remember from a few years ago.\nThe main thing I\u2019ve learned from migrating between a few browsers over the past couple of months has been that the design and performance differences between them are smaller than ever before. If you\u2019re like me and want to strip your browser down to a bare address bar and a couple of arrows, you can do that as easily with Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, or any of the other alternatives like Edge and Vivaldi. Your bookmarks can travel with you across operating systems and devices with most browsers. Keyboard shortcuts like Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + T to revive the last-closed browser window are approaching universality. Chrome and Firefox both have a \u201cclose tabs to the right [of this one]\u201d option. You can mute individual tabs in both browsers.",

        "title": "WebKit code references suggest dark mode coming to macOS 10.14",
        "body": "Earlier today, we reported on WebKit\u2019s mailing list suggesting that iOS 12 will support iPhone 5s. Following that, I decided to look into WebKit\u2019s source code to see what else could be found about future Apple releases. For those who don\u2019t know, WebKit is the engine behind Safari on both macOS and iOS, it\u2019s developed in the open so it\u2019s natural that it will eventually hint at future iOS and macOS features.\nNew code implemented in March seems to suggest that macOS will get some sort of system-wide dark mode on 10.14. The code in question is designed to adapt WebKit\u2019s rendering of a website based on the effective appearance of the application. Appearances are the way through which macOS can change the look of UI components like buttons and lists based on assets provided by the system.\nThere is a \u201cdark mode\u201d appearance already present on macOS since El Capitan, but it\u2019s only used when the app developer opts into using it explicitly, this was demonstrated by a previous experiment of mine showing several of Apple\u2019s apps running with this dark mode applied.\nThis is what happens when you build WebKit without the OS version checks and implement effectiveAppearance on NSApplication to return the dark appearance (notice the button and pop up). Dark Mode \u00ae pic.twitter.com/svWS48FCge \u2014 Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) April 21, 2018\nHaving the concept of a system appearance means Apple is working on a way to change the appearance of apps globally, although there are no direct references to a dark mode (for obvious reasons), but the most likely reason for the existence of an API like this is a dark mode.\nWhile this is not a definitive confirmation, it\u2019s definitely a significant hint at a system-wide dark mode coming with macOS 10.14. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find any similar references for iOS 12.\nDo you want dark mode on macOS and iOS? Let us know in the comments.\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

        "title": "Apple offers free battery replacements for select MacBook Pro models",
        "body": "Apple quietly launched a new battery replacement program to help a \"limited number\" of MacBook Pro users. According to the program's webpage, some 13-inch MacBook Pros without Touch Bars may experience component failure that causes the built-in battery to swell. It's not a safety issue, but Apple will replace batteries on the affected laptops for free.\nThe company didn't provide details about which component inside these MacBook Pros could fail and cause the battery to expand. Affected laptops were manufactured between October 2016 and October 2017, and users can check to see if their device is eligible by inputting the device's serial number into the program's webpage. Older MacBook Pros and MacBook Pro models with Touch Bars shouldn't be affected.\nIf your device is eligible for the battery replacement program, you can either take your laptop to an Apple Authorized Service Provider or an Apple retail store to have it serviced. Authorized personnel may need to send the laptop to Apple's Repair Center for a few days, and you have the option to immediately send the device into the repair center yourself rather than going to a store first. Apple advises users to back up all data on their MacBook Pros and repair any other problems with the device before getting it serviced.\nAdvertisement\nIt's unclear how many MacBook Pros may be affected by this issue, but Apple clearly wants to help users by fixing the problem as quickly and painlessly as possible. This isn't the first time Apple has provided free-of-charge battery replacements for some of its devices: recently it launched a program to replace batteries in 42mm Apple Watch Series 2 models that either have swollen batteries or will not power on. The company also extended the warranty on first-generation Apple Watch models for an additional two years, providing battery replacements for free for up to three years after the original date of purchase.\nBut those who suffer from lackluster iPhone batteries still have to pay up. After Apple's slow-down fiasco at the end of 2017, the company began offering $29 discounted battery replacements for select iPhone models at the start of this year. While that's better than the $79 out-of-warranty price users would have had to pay to replace their iPhones' batteries previously, some still argue that the service should be offered for free for affected iPhones. Apple is offering the discounted iPhone battery replacement price through the end of this year.",

        "title": "Apple Seeking OLED Display Price Cut From Samsung Amid Rumors Next iPhone X Will Start at $899",
        "body": "Apple wants to reduce the price it pays Samsung for OLED displays used in current and future iPhone X models, according to DigiTimes.\nThe report, citing industry sources, claims Apple is requiring Samsung to lower its price to $100 per panel, down around 9.1 percent from the $110 that research firm IHS Markit estimated the iPhone maker paid in 2017.\nRather confusingly, the report first says Apple is negotiating with Samsung about the revised price, but later says it is a requirement.\nIf the price cut is indeed being forced upon Samsung, then Apple likely feels confident in its ability to secure OLED displays from LG as a second supplier, and is thereby benefitting from diversifying its supply chain and making its suppliers compete against each other on price in an effort to win millions of orders.\nLG is widely considered to be ramping up its OLED display production capabilities in hopes of securing orders for Apple's next-generation iPhone lineup, but a recent report claimed mass production challenges have caused the company to fall behind schedule. It's unclear if those issues have been resolved.\nApple is expected to purchase up to 100 million OLED displays from Samsung in 2018, to be used for the current iPhone X, in addition to a second-generation iPhone X and so-called iPhone X Plus expected to launch in 2018.\nPrice cuts to the display and other components would help Apple lower its bill of materials for the iPhone X and future models, and the savings could potentially be passed on to customers. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani, for example, believes the second-generation iPhone X will start at $899, down from $999.\nNo doubt, Apple's own bottom line also stands to benefit from reduced production costs, so these negotiations are most likely par for the course.",

        "title": "App Store shrank for first time in 2017 thanks to crackdowns on spam, clones and more",
        "body": "App Store shrank for first time in 2017 thanks to crackdowns on spam, clones and more\nThe App Store shrank for the first time in 2017, according to a new report from Appfigures. The report found the App Store lost 5 percent of its total apps over the course of the year, dropping from 2.2 million published iOS apps in the beginning of the year to 2.1 million by year-end.\nGoogle Play, meanwhile, grew in 2017 \u2014 it was up 30 percent to more than 3.6 million apps.\nAppfigures speculated the changes had to do with a combination of factors, including stricter enforcement of Apple\u2019s review guidelines, along with a technical change requiring app developers to update their apps to the 64-bit architecture.\nApple had also promised back in 2016 that it would clean up its iOS App Store by removing outdated, abandoned apps, including those that no longer met current guidelines or didn\u2019t function as intended. That cleanup may have well stretched into 2017, as app store intelligence firms only started seeing the effects in late 2016. For example, there was a spike in app removals back in October 2016.\nThen in 2017, Apple went after clones and spam apps on the App Store. Combined with those apps that weren\u2019t 64-bit compatible and those that hadn\u2019t been downloaded in years, the removals reached into the hundreds of thousands over a 12-month period. Apple later went after template-based apps, too, before dialing back its policies over concerns it was impacting small businesses\u2019 ability to compete on the App Store.\nTo see the App Store shrink, given these clear-outs, isn\u2019t necessarily surprising. However, Appfigures found that removals of existing apps weren\u2019t the only cause. iOS developers weren\u2019t releasing as many apps as they had during the growth years, it also claims.\nAndroid developers launched 17 percent more apps in 2017 to reach 1.5 million total new releases. But iOS developers launched just 755,00 new apps \u2014 a 29 percent drop and the largest drop since 2008.\nBut this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean developers weren\u2019t creating as many iOS apps \u2014 it could mean that Apple\u2019s review team has gotten tougher about how many apps it allows in. Thanks to the spam and clone app crackdown, fewer apps of questionable quality are being approved these days.\nIn addition, some portion of the new Android app releases during the year were iOS apps being ported to the Google Play platform. More than twice as many apps came to Android in 2017 than Android apps coming to iOS, the report said.\nThe full report also developed into the numbers of cross-platform apps (450,000 are on both stores), the most popular non-native tools (Cordova and Unity), the rise in native development, the countries shipping the most apps (U.S. followed by China) and the Play Store\u2019s growth.\nIt can be viewed here.",
